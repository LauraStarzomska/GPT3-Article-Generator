BMW M4 GT3 at the Sebring 12 Hours: Challenge for the podium ends with disappointing finish.;On its first appearance at the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA), the brand-new BMW M4 GT3 challenged at the very top of both the GTD PRO and the GTD class until the final stages. But the podium was narrowly missed in both classes. In GTD PRO, BMW M Team RLL’s #24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 crossed the line in fourth. The same result was scored by Turner Motorsport in the GTD class with the #96 BMW M4 GT3.;Sebring. On its first appearance at the 12 Hours of Sebring    (USA), the brand-new BMW M4 GT3 challenged at the very top of both    the GTD PRO and the GTD class until the final stages. But it was not    meant to be and the podium was narrowly missed in both classes. In    GTD PRO, BMW M Team RLL’s #24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, driven by Philipp    Eng (AUT), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR), crossed the    line in fourth. The same result was scored by Turner Motorsport in    the GTD class with the #96 BMW M4 GT3. The Florida endurance classic    marked the second round of the 2022 IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Starting from seventh on the grid, the #24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 moved up  the field into the podium positions and briefly lead the GTD PRO class  by the halfway mark. From then on it was involved in a thrilling  battle for the lead and the second six hours turned into a proper  sprint race. The car ran like a clockwork, the team acted cleverly on  strategy and Eng, Yelloly and Wittmann faultlessly completed their  laps. The #24 was lying in second position until one hour before the  chequered flag when it suffered a gearbox issue and dropped off the  podium positions. The #25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 also raced into top three in the opening  stage of the race but suffered a setback after two hours. A power  steering issue resulted in a long repair. This dropped the trio of  Augusto Farfus (BRA), John Edwards (USA) and Connor De Phillippi (USA)  down the field but they continued the race. They brought the #25 home  in tenth place. The two BMW M Motorsport teams in the GTD class also both had an  eventful 12 hours that did not end with the top results they would  have deserved. At Turner Motorsport, Sebring marked the 500th BMW race  for Bill Auberlen (USA) and until the eighth hour it looked that the  Californian could have lots of reason to celebrate at that milestone.  Auberlen, who shared the #96 BMW M4 GT3 with Robby Foley and Michael  Dinan (both USA), had taken the GTD lead but then got hit at the rear  by another competitor and spun into the grass. This dropped the #96  back to eighth in the class. But the Turner Motorsport drivers fought  their way back and with three and a half hours to go, Auberlen brought  the car back in the lead. The #96 stayed at the very top before losing  ground in the final stages due to a team mistake and crossing the line  in fourth. The newest BMW M Motorsport family member, Paul Miller Racing,  experienced cruel bad luck in the race after showing convincing  performances in all sessions. In the first three hours of racing, the  #1 BMW M 4 GT3 was fighting for the very top in GTD class. But then it  became victim of an LMP incident. A car trying to avoid a spinning  LMP2 car hit the #1 on the left rear damaging the suspension. This was  a major setback on Paul Miller Racing’s way to a very strong result in  their first race with the BMW M4 GT3. Madison Snow, Bryan Sellers  (both USA) and Erik Johansson (SWE) finished 16th in the GTD class. The BMW M Motorsport team’s BMW M4 GT4 cars have been in action  already on Thursday in the two-hour IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge  race. The #43 Stephen Cameron Racing BMW M4 GT4 crossed the line in  fifth position. Sean Quinlan and Gregory Liefooghe (both USA) shared  duties in this car. Turner Motorsport finished ninth with the #95 BMW  M4 GT4, driven by Auberlen and Dillon Machavern (USA). Their  team-mates Foley and Vincent Barletta (USA) retired in the #96 car. Reactions after the Sebring 12 Hours: Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “After  twelve exciting hours of racing we leave Sebring with mixed feelings.  This race has once again confirmed that endurance racing not only has  highlights in store but can also bring setbacks and the final results  have been disappointing, of course. Right up into the final phase it  looked as if we could finish on the GTD PRO podium with our #24 and  BMW M Team RLL. But a race isn’t over until the chequered flag, and  unfortunately a gearbox problem set us back a good hour before the  end. The podium was clearly in the cards. I’m convinced that the  number 25 would have fought for the rostrum as well if it hadn’t been  for the early problem with the power steering. It was important that  we covered a lot of race kilometres with this car, too, to gather  information. In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport also was on course  for the podium until the very end but then dropped back. Paul Miller  Racing also was among the favourites with the BMW M4 GT3. It’s a shame  that the team was denied a well-deserved top result through no fault  of their own. Overall, our conclusion is that the pace and performance  of all four cars were very good. Now it’s time to analyse and fix the  problems that have arisen.” Marco Wittmann (BMW M Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, 4th    place GTD PRO): “It’s been a highlight for me to race on  this famous track for the first time. It was a mega event and a lot of  fun. We were fighting at the top with a competitive car all weekend.  In the race, we were able to show our potential and fight for the lead  with the Corvette. BMW M Motorsport, BMW M Team RLL and my fellow  drivers did a great job and showed a very good performance.  Unfortunately, we dropped back one hour before the end due to a  technical problem. Although we missed the podium, we can take a lot of  positives from this race. I’m sure the first podium will come soon.” John Edwards (BMW M Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, 10th place    GTD PRO): “Unfortunately we had a technical issue quite  early in the race that cost us a lot of time. After that we took the  race as a test session. It was important for Connor and myself to get  a couple of hours in the car to learn as much as possible for the rest  of the season. We are disappointed with our result but it was good to  see that the car was competitive. That gives us confidence for the  next race in Long Beach.” Bill Auberlen (Turner Motorsport, #96 BMW M4 GT3, 4th place  GTD): “The new BMW M4 GT3 ran perfectly over the twelve  hours. We lead a lot of this race – didn’t quite have the pace to win  it, but stayed in second. Due to an error with the calculation of my  maximum driving time we had to come to the pits. Otherwise we would  have lost all our points. This one was much better than Daytona. Let’s  take this, take the points and move on to the next one.” Bryan Sellers (Paul Miller Racing, #1 BMW M4 GT3, 16th place  GTD): “We had a very good showing which was ended by someone  else’s mistake. We started very strong, taking the lead and were  pretty much in control of the race with a 30-second gap to the  second-placed car. The balance of the BMW M4 GT3 was very good and all  drivers did similar lap times. Then we were taken out by another car.  But still it was important to get the car fixed and bring it to the  finish line. It was our first race with it and there is a lot to  learn. So every lap of experience is extremely valuable.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Preparations for the 2022 WorldSBK: Two days of intensive testing in Misano for BMW Motorrad Motorsport.;In preparation for the 2022 season of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad Motorsport this week completed the first of three back-to-back pre-season tests. In Misano (ITA), the two BMW teams – the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team – both worked through an extensive test programme on Wednesday and Thursday.;Misano. In preparation for the 2022 season of the FIM    Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad Motorsport    this week completed the first of three back-to-back pre-season    tests. In Misano (ITA), the two BMW teams – the BMW Motorrad    WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team – both worked    through an extensive test programme on Wednesday and Thursday. A    further two tests will follow in Barcelona (ESP) on 25th and 26th    March, and at MotorLand Aragón (ESP) on 4th and 5th April. Many areas of the BMW M 1000 RR have been optimised and developed  over the course of the winter break. As such, Scott Redding (GBR / BMW  Motorrad WorldSBK Team) and the two riders from the Bonovo action BMW  Racing Team, Eugene Laverty (IRL) and Loris Baz (FRA), tested many new  components and set-up variants. The areas that have been developed by  BMW Motorrad Motorsport include the engine, brakes, riding geometry  and ergonomics as seats and fuel tank shapes. In addition, individual  rideability options for the riders had been generated in the  electronics area. The three factory riders provided more input, on the basis of which  BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the two teams will now work closely  together to prepare for the coming tests. BMW newcomers Redding and  Baz also used the test to familiarise themselves further with the BMW  M 1000 RR. Overall, the three riders completed over 1,700 kilometres  of testing without any issues. Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team was  unable to attend the test in Misano, due to an injury. He fractured  his leg in a crash whilst training on his mountain bike. This injury  also means the Dutchman is unable to take part in the tests in  Barcelona and at MotorLand Aragón. BMW factory rider Ilya Mikhalchik  (UKR) will replace him as the reserve rider at these tests. Three-time  IDM champion Mikhalchik is part of the BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team in the FIM Endurance World Championship and also lines up in the  Spanish Superbike Championship this season. Quotes after the Misano test. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “First of all, we wish Michael a good and speedy recovery, of course.  His absence shortly before the start of the season is obviously very  unfortunate. With him being absent we partly were missing a reference  to last year’s topics which made the test work a bit more difficult.  However, in Ilya we have a very good replacement, who will stand in  for him at the next two tests. With him we can now work through the  test list, fine-tune the 2022 package and Michael’s crew can gel. Ilya  knows the BMW M 1000 RR well and is thus able to provide valuable  input. He is a strong BMW factory rider, and has thus earned the  opportunity to test the WorldSBK package. Nevertheless, our two days  of testing have been overall very constructive. Our new riders could  gather experience with the BMW M 1000 RR and get acquainted with the  new developments.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We had only one rider testing with Scott but it has been a  real positive test. The feedback we got from all our test items was  that we made good steps forward over the winter period. So from Jerez  to where we are today has confirmed what we have been doing, mainly  chassis, electronics and engine. Especially the engine development has  proved to be a good steps for all the guys from BMW. The first day was  a lot about evaluation and the second day was a bit more of  fine-tuning the set-up and that went pretty well. I am really happy  with the fact that we focused mainly on the SC0 tyre for him. He has  not got that set-up yet for him where he could use the extra grip of  the SCX or the SCQ. So all work was with the SC0 and it was a good,  solid test with a lot of positives to take away.” Scott Redding, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “So we  finished the two days test here in Misano. I’m really happy with the  work that we have done. We changed a lot at the bike angles. We had  some new parts to test. That changed a lot on the bike. So we focused  mainly on getting a feeling for me with this bike. It was very  positive, and I enjoyed the two days here. We made some good steps,  and we managed to close the gap to the front guys. That was important  to me. I can go home from this test very happy. So we are going in the  right direction, and I’m looking forward to Barcelona.” Michael Galinski, Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team:  “As a team we are really satisfied with this test on both  sides of the garage, as both riders made a step forward. Overall, they  have been on the same level. The new parts, especially the new engines  we got from BMW, are top and a significant improvement. We made some  steps forward also with the other items we could test. We are still  lacking nine tenths of a second to the very top but we got closer und  were able to continuously improve. The team grew together very well.  Both sides are on the same level now, and it was the second time for  us to work in the final team constellation. Now I am already looking  forward to the Barcelona test. This will be another challenge as it is  known that there is a bit less grip. Nevertheless we are looking  forward to it and to the next step we can make there.” Eugene Laverty, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “Today  was really good. I made some progress because yesterday I still didn’t  feel quite comfortable on the bike. Today especially in braking  improved a lot. The bike is now transferring correctly. I’m a smaller  rider than the other guys. So we needed to make some changes. Now I  feel much more comfortable and make some really consistent lap time.  So I’m really happy with the step.” Loris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I am  really happy. I did not know what to expect. In Jerez, everything was  totally new for me coming from a completely different bike. After  then, we had a long break, so I was really happy to get back on the  BMW M 1000 RR. This track is completely different, also the grip level  is completely different but I was pretty happy straight away with the  new engine spec and the electronic development that the guys have  done. So, yes, I am really happy with the direction they took, I think  it is the right one. I am happy with the pace and over the two days I  managed to do a lot of consistent laps on the race tyre. I’m really  happy with the job done, we are also close to Scott and Eugene so it’s  a good direction for BMW.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Technology and exclusivity in a new dimension.;At today's BMW Group Annual Conference, Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development, presents the first details of the future BMW 7 Series.;Munich. A few weeks before its world premiere and on  the occasion of today's BMW Group Annual Conference, Frank Weber,  Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development, presents  details of the new BMW 7 Series. The focus is initially on technology  highlights, a new front-end design based on hallmark BMW design  features and a unique interior experience consisting of digital  features and exclusive materials. In April, the premium car  manufacturer will present the all-electric BMW i7 (combined power  consumption: 19.7 – 18.9 kWh/100 km according to WLTP; up to an  estimated 305 mi EPA electric range;" forecast based on the vehicle's  development status to date) and with it the entire new BMW 7 Series.  Being the first all-electric luxury sedan in the world, it brings  innovative driving pleasure to the road with a range of more than 600 kilometers.With the all-electric BMW i7, the Bavarian premium automobile  manufacturer is expanding its range of locally emission-free vehicles  to the exclusive segment of its top-of-the-range models. """"The new  BMW 7 Series is absolutely trail-blazing in every respect. Like no  other model, the BMW 7 Series stands for BMW's innovative  strength,"""" says Weber. """"The all-electric BMW i7 is also the  most powerful BMW 7 Series. It combines the best driving experience  with the ultimate digital experience. This makes it the ideal vehicle  for forward-thinking, responsible decision-makers and avant-garde pioneers.""""In the BMW i7, the characteristic design elements of twin round  headlights and BMW grille have been completely reinterpreted to  achieve a modern and distinctive look. Some of the special design  statements are upper light elements made of exclusive crystal glass  and the illuminated contour of the kidney grille.In the interior, the focus is on the innovative user experience  created with new My Modes and the latest generation of the iDrive  operating system. My Modes enable the driver to precisely customise  the car’s driving characteristics and interior ambience. In addition  to the BMW Curved Display, a new type of light and function strip on  the instrument panel and the doors provides a visual and haptic  quality that is as modern as it is exclusive. The BMW Interaction Bar  is part of the ambient lighting and also features integrated control  buttons. In addition, the newly developed Sky Lounge panoramic glass  roof adds to the feeling of spaciousness, modernity and well-being  that prevails in the interior of the new BMW 7 Series with LED light  threads that can be individually adjusted.The rear of the BMW i7 offers outstanding travel comfort and sets new  entertainment standards offering a unique cinematic experience. The  BMW Theatre Screen, which moves out of the roof liner, is an  ultra-wide screen with a 31 inch screen, 32 : 9 panoramic display  format and 8K streaming resolution. It transforms the rear seats into  an exclusive, private cinema lounge where passengers can select their  personal entertainment programme from a diverse range of streaming  offers and enjoy watching it while driving in BMW's new  top-of-the-range models.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Statement Dr Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Annual Conference 2022;Statement Dr Peter Annual Conference 2022;Good Morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.Despite the challenging conditions, the BMW Group once again achieved  its goals in all segments. Our positive business performance is  reflected in our strong financial results for the past year. An EBIT  margin of 10.3% for our automotive business puts us at the upper end  of our adjusted target range, as expected. The Free Cashflow in the  Automotive Segment amounted to 6.4 billion euros, as forecast. We also  met all our non-financial targets, in particular the further reduction  of our CO2 fleet emissions. The rating agencies Moody’s and S&P have also recognised the BMW  Group’s positive business development and revised their outlook  upwards over the course of the year. We have now published our  financial statements in our Integrated BMW Group Report for the second  time. In addition to financial key figures, we have also expanded our  reporting to include non-financial indicators fully in line with SASB  standards. Information on the EU Taxonomy was also included for the  first time. Let’s take a look at the business development in detail. After a  difficult 2020, due to the pandemic, 2021 was no less demanding.  Despite problems with semiconductor supplies, we came through the year  relatively well and took advantage of opportunities to further improve  price realisation worldwide. At this point I would like to thank the  many colleagues in all areas of the company who continue to show  extraordinary commitment. In particular, our thoughts are with the  many employees of our suppliers in Ukraine. After a strong first half-year, semiconductor supply issues  intensified, as expected, in the second half of the year. Fixed costs,  which increased as planned towards the end of the year, also had an impact. Revenues for the full year climbed to around 111 billion euros –  against the backdrop of positive pricing for new and pre-owned  vehicles and the higher volume of sales. The significantly higher  financial result primarily reflects the positive earnings contribution  of our Chinese joint venture, BBA, which increased by more than 40%.  Valuation effects, including interest rate hedging instruments, also  had a positive impact. Group earnings before tax increased significantly to around 16  billion euros. The previous year had been weak, due to the pandemic.  At 14%, the Group EBT margin was well above our long-term minimum  target of 10%. Strong pricing for new and pre-owned vehicles, in  particular, was a key driver for earnings. We also delivered more  vehicles to customers than in the previous year. And, finally, there  were the positive one-time effects, we have already communicated. This  included the partial reversal of the provision for the EU antitrust  proceedings and the modernisation of the pension scheme for employees  in Germany. Ladies and Gentlemen, Our strategic approach remains focused on  emission-free mobility. The new all-electric BMW iX and the sporty BMW  i4 are once again demonstrating our technology leadership. Our order  books are very well-filled. The BMW i7 will once again set new  standards in all major areas of innovation – especially  electrification, digitalisation – including for example rear-seat  entertainment – and highly-automated driving. We will present the i7  to you in April. Our sixth-generation electric drivetrains developed  in-house will bring further major steps in efficiency and range. We invested a total of around 5 billion euros in this and other  future projects in 2021, as well as in our global production network  and new models. The capex ratio of 4.5% was below our target figure of  5%, as planned. With the full consolidation of BBA, where extensive  plant expansions are currently underway, we expect a slightly higher  ratio of around 5% for 2022. I will address the details of the impact  of full consolidation later. Research and development expenditure remains at a high level, with a  priority on emission-free mobility. In addition to expenses for new  models, a major focus in 2021 was on preparations for the Neue Klasse,  which is scheduled to ramp up in the middle of the decade. R&D  costs according to IFRS increased to 6.3 billion euros. The R&D  ratio of 6.2%, according to the German Commercial Code, was in line  with our expectations. In 2022, the ratio will be back within our  long-term target range of 5 to 5.5%, also due to the full  consolidation of BBA. Today, well over half of our total investments  are in the future fields of e-mobility, digitalisation and highly  automated driving. Ladies and Gentlemen, This year, in recognition of this positive  business development, our employees in Germany will also enjoy the  highest-ever profit-sharing bonus for the financial year 2021. Last  autumn, we also expanded the preferred stock programme for employees,  which has been in place since 1989. This has enjoyed a very positive response. We also want our shareholders to participate in the company’s  success. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will  propose a dividend of 5.80 euros per share of common stock and 5.82  euros per share of preferred stock to the Annual General Meeting. This  represents a pay-out ratio of 30.7%, which is within our long-term  strategic target range of 30-40%. Already today, the BMW Group has a healthy balance sheet and the  potential to generate sustainably high free cash flow. The full  consolidation of BBA in the BMW Group Financial Statements from  February onwards will further increase this potential. The Board of  Management and Supervisory Board will therefore propose to the Annual  General Meeting, that the Board of Management be authorised to  repurchase and retire reacquired shares. This would create the option  of returning available capital to shareholders via share repurchases,  in addition to the annual dividend. Ladies and Gentlemen, Let’s take a closer look now at business  development in 2021 in the individual segments. In the Automotive Segment, we delivered a total of more than 2.5  million vehicles to customers last year, including over 100,000  all-electric cars. The segment’s operating earnings totalled almost 10  billion euros. At 10.3%, the EBIT margin is at the upper end of our  adjusted target range, as forecast. The year-on-year comparison mainly  reflected the positive effects of improved pricing and higher volumes.  Our aftersales business also saw significant growth. The exceptionally  strong residual value development was another factor that contributed  to the increase. Ongoing efficiency measures from our Performance  Programme also took effect in 2021. The partial reversal of the  provision for the EU antitrust proceedings, as well as the valuation  effect of modernising the pension scheme for employees in Germany,  also had a positive effect. Higher research and development spending, in particular for the  further ramp-up of e-mobility due to very strong demand, as well as  for digitalisation, dampened EBIT much more than the previous year, as  we had projected. The net balance of raw material prices and currency  effects resulted in a headwind in the mid-three-digit million-euro  range, as forecast. The positive operating result was also the main driver for strong  cash development in the financial year 2021. Despite higher capital  expenditure, free cash flow in the Automotive Segment totalled 6.4  billion euros and therefore met our expectations and our guidance. In  contrast to the previous year, this did not include an inflow from  BBA's dividend payments. For 2022, we expect a free cash flow of at  least 12 billion euros, which includes an expected one-time  cash-inflow of about 5 billion euros from the BBA full consolidation.  This consists of a positive effect from recognising BBA’s liquid  assets in the balance sheet for the first time. This effect is  partially offset by payment of the acquisition price of around 3.7  billion euros. This strong free cash flow in the financial year 2021 is also  reflected positively in the BMW Group’s liquidity position. In preparation for payment of the purchase price for increasing our  shareholding in BBA, the company had increased its liquidity to 20.3  billion euros at the end of last year. Let’s turn now to the Financial Services Segment, which posted  pre-tax earnings at a high level of 3.75 billion euros in 2021, mostly  due to the favourable risk situation. The number of new contracts with  retail customers climbed 6% year-on-year to almost two million. At the  same time, the average financing volume per vehicle also increased.  Residual values and credit risks improved significantly from the  previous year, which had been impacted by the pandemic. The return on  equity of 22.6% was at the high end of our adjusted target range of 20  to 23%. We review our risk provisioning on an ongoing basis, taking  into account all relevant current developments: From today’s  perspective, we have continued to make appropriate provisions for our  business risks. The Motorcycles Segment also delivered a very strong performance in  2021, with five new models and three model updates. With total sales  of more than 194,000 units worldwide, we reported strong growth in all  regions, especially our strategic growth markets, the US and China. At  8.3%, the EBIT margin was within our target range of 8-10%. Pre-tax  earnings more than doubled year-on-year to almost 230 million euros. Let’s move on to the Other Entities Segment and intersegment  eliminations. As expected, the net balance for pre-tax earnings of 274  million euros was significantly lower than the previous year. Positive  valuation effects from interest rate hedging instruments, driven by  higher interest rates, were more than offset by higher intersegment  eliminations caused by the increased leasing business volume. Ladies and Gentlemen, Let’s turn our attention now to the current  year. As you know, we have increased our stake in our Chinese joint  venture, BBA, to 75% and extended the joint venture contract to 2040,  as planned. With the completion of this transaction in February of this year, BBA  will be fully consolidated in the BMW Group’s Financial Statements.  BBA’s earnings contribution was previously reported in the financial  result as part of the at-equity consolidation. With full  consolidation, BBA will be fully reflected in all positions of the  income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement. This also includes revaluing the existing 50% stake to the current  market value. This will result in an estimated positive one-off effect  of between 7 to 8 billion euros in the financial result. Full  consolidation will increase both revenues and the absolute EBIT result  in the Automotive Segment. This will, however, be partially offset by  an annual depreciation expense from the purchase price allocation over  the coming years. A technical effect from the initial consolidation in  connection with intra-Group deliveries will also dampen earnings in  2022. For this reason, we do not anticipate any significant impact on  the EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment in the current year. Ladies and Gentlemen, We are securing our future competitiveness by  investing in future technologies today. At the same time, we always  maintain a clear focus on our financial performance. We remain  committed to our long-term target range of 8-10% for the EBIT margin  in the Automotive Segment. Profitability and efficiency remain our  focus, in all segments and across all brands. Let’s now turn to our Outlook for 2022 in detail. Our guidance for  this year reflects the current status of our planning and includes the  impact of the BBA full consolidation. The war in Ukraine is having a  substantial effect on the country’s automotive suppliers, with supply  restrictions resulting in production interruptions at several BMW  Group plants. This is already taken into account in our outlook, to  the extent that the impact is currently predictable. Regarding the ongoing semiconductor supply shortages, we do not  expect the situation to ease before the second half of 2022. An  initial impact of rising raw material and energy prices is included in  the outlook for the current year. Further significant price increases in connection with the war in  Ukraine and the related sanctions are not part of the forecast.  Possible longer-term effects of the conflict in Ukraine cannot be  estimated at the present time and are therefore also not reflected in  our outlook. We continue to monitor closely current developments regarding the  coronavirus pandemic, particularly in China. Any further possible  negative impact on our business is not currently included in our outlook. Ladies and Gentlemen, The BMW Group has proven its financial strength  and flexibility time and again. In extremely volatile times, we manage  our business with prudence and clear focus. Our young, attractive  product portfolio is well received by customers, particularly the MINI  E*, the BMW iX and the BMW i4. Despite the current supply bottlenecks  due to the current geopolitical situation, we are confident that the  positive business development will continue in 2022. For the Group's pre-tax profit, we expect a significant increase  compared to the previous year. The main driver is the BBA full  consolidation from 11 February. Due to the inclusion of the  approximately 26,500 employees from China in the workforce for the  first time, the BMW Group's headcount will increase significantly in 2022. Thanks to high customer demand and new models, we had originally  planned a slight growth in deliveries in the Automotive Segment. As a  result of the negative effects of the war in Ukraine, in particular  the production interruptions due to supply constraints at local  suppliers, we now expect deliveries to remain at the level of the  previous year. Deliveries of electrified vehicles are forecast to increase  significantly this year. The number of all-electric vehicles is  expected to more than double. Based on the original planning,  including BBA full consolidation, we had expected the EBIT margin in  the Automotive Segment to be in the upper half of our strategic target  range of 8 to 10%. As previously mentioned, the BBA full consolidation  has no significant impact on the margin in 2022. As a result of the  war in Ukraine however, we now expect a margin of between 7 and 9%. In the Motorcycles segment, we expect a slight increase in  deliveries. The EBIT margin is forecast to be in the target range of 8-10%. In the Financial Services segment, we should see a return on equity  within the range of 14 to 17% in 2022. The reporting year 2021 was  characterised by an exceptionally positive risk situation. Ladies and Gentlemen, The BMW Group is committed to consistently  strong performance, even in volatile times – and we have been able to  accomplish this yet again. Operationally, we are well positioned for  the challenges ahead. Over the past two years, the coronavirus  pandemic and semiconductor shortages have challenged our flexibility  and commitment to deliver top performance more than ever before. Despite the high volatility, we have continued to drive forward our  transformation. We remain committed to the BMW way. Now, I’ll hand  over to Oliver, who will talk about what this means for us in more  detail. Thank you.  *: Consumption/Emissions data: MINI Cooper SE: Power consumption in kWh/100 km  combined: 16.8-14.8 NEDC, 18-15.5 WLTP. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Statement Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Annual Conference 2022 ;Statement Zipse Annual Conference 2022;Good Morning, Ladies and Gentlemen! The BMW Group has proven time and time again that it can master  challenging situations, emerging even stronger than before. Think  about the global economic and financial crisis, the coronavirus  pandemic or the semiconductor supply shortages. In unpredictable times, it is even more important to do the right  thing. For us, this currently means three things: 1. First, we are helping out wherever our assistance is needed. Max  Schöberl just gave an overview of the Group’s position. Our thoughts  are with all those who are suffering as well as with our suppliers and  our partners. The BMW Group stands for both the peaceful coexistence  of all cultures and free global trade, which brings people closer  together and leads to progress and prosperity in every region of the world. 2. Second, we are working to secure and keep our operating business  running – because we can only provide effective support for others and  serve the common good if we as a company are able to perform in a  strong manner. 3. And third, we are also continuing to work tirelessly towards our  long-term goals. This is our most fundamental task. It is what BMW is  all about. If we fail to do this, we lose valuable time. The  commitment to climate neutrality is a huge task for the global  community. We all must act, intensively and without delay. The BMW Group has a robust capital structure. We are a highly  flexible, global company that calls all regions of the world home.  Even the current situation will not change our long-term perspective.  For us, every year is just the next step in our BMW journey. We will make a difference. To create value that our customers ask  for. To generate meaningful added value. We balance the legitimate  demands of all stakeholders – because we all need, live with and  benefit from mobility. We also view the environment as an important stakeholder. We were the  first German automotive manufacturer to join the Business Ambition for  1.5°C campaign launched by the Science-Based Targets Initiative. As a  result, our road to climate neutrality in 2050 follows a  scientifically validated, transparent path that spans the entire value  chain. That is my understanding of holistic responsibility. Global markets develop at different speeds. To have maximum impact on  the climate, we need a diversity of technological solutions and  offerings. Because: Our future will be decided by technologies.  Customers expect tech magic – products that fascinate. This car right here was one of the highlights of the CES in Las  Vegas. It perfectly embodies what we aim to do at BMW: Technological  innovations that inspire people. We have shown what is possible – and  we definitely succeeded with the iX Flow. Digitalised vehicles are created in a digitalised company. We are  pioneering the use of artificial intelligence in our industry: Several  hundred AI applications are already being used in our production phase  alone. We are creating a virtual image of production processes in our  global network – a revolution in factory planning. Further digitalising processes and structures lowers costs, improves  quality and efficiency, and helps us reach our sustainability goals  quickly and effectively.Our aim is to lead the transformation of our industry. This will  require adaptability as well as resilience. This means reliability,  stability and operational excellence, on the one hand, and courage,  disruption and forging our own technology-based path on the other.  These characteristics can turn transformation into a competitive  advantage for us – because, in this process, we can fully exploit our  renowned BMW capabilities. Let me give you a few examples: 1. We are accelerating our e-mobility ramp-up in a precise manner in  line with growing demand. By the end of 2025, we aim to have delivered  two million fully electric vehicles to customers. By 2030, at least  half our global deliveries should be BEVs – and we are doing  everything we can to meet this goal earlier. By then, our BEV sales  could already surpass 1.5 million per year – depending, among other  things, on how quickly the charging infrastructure expands worldwide,  and how the supply of raw materials for batteries shapes up. 2. The BMW i Vision Circular is our look ahead to what sustainable  and luxurious mobility could look like in the urban environment of  2040. With this vehicle, BMW has impressively laid claim to the next  big cross-industry topic of circularity and defined it for itself. 3. In 2025, we will embark on Phase III of our transformation with a  major leap in technology. The NEUE KLASSE will be built on our new  vehicle architecture. This means digital and circular, with  substantially improved efficiency for uncompromising e-mobility. Our  future Gen 6 drivetrain generation enables lower costs, enhanced  performance, new cell chemistry and new cell formats. The  profitability of the NEUE KLASSE therefore needs to be on par with  vehicles that have state-of-the-art internal combustion engines. BMW  should remain an attractive investment. 4. With the launch of the NEUE KLASSE at our new plant in Hungary in  2025, we are also taking our production network into new spheres:  lean, green and digital. We are preparing every plant for this. We  call it the BMW iFactory. 5. The car is becoming a digital device – and BMW is right at the  forefront. Independent from the drive technology, we also offer  over-the-air Remote Software Upgrades. In this way, BMW has the  world’s largest fleet that can be upgraded continuously. 6. We are collaborating with the best tech players in all regions of  the world and with partners from other industries – for example,  within the framework of Catena-X. When it comes to all-solid-state  batteries, we believe we have the strongest partner in this field with  Solid Power. We are establishing long-term cooperation with Qualcomm  Technologies and Arriver to develop next-generation software for  driver assistance systems and automated driving. Together, we will  provide industry-leading software functions for automated driving,  ranging from New Car Assessment Program Level 2 and Level 2+ Driving  Assistance Systems to Level 3 High Automated Driving functionalities.  7. Our BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture has been fully  consolidated in the Group Financial Statements of BMW AG since  February. With this move, the BMW Group is taking its growth to the  next level. BMW continues to be a long-standing partner of China and  the Liaoning Province. China is a driving force and pacesetter for  digital trends. We will now be even closer to customers there, keeping  our finger on the digital pulse. 8. In past weeks, we have also secured the trademark rights of the  ALPINA brand. In doing so, we will ensure the longevity of this  tradition-rich brand while leading it into a new future.All these examples show: We are leveraging the transformation with  purpose in order to highlight our strengths. Our success benefits many different stakeholders:     The fact of the matter is:Our successful transformation is good for everyone. We consider it a privilege to be able to operate independently in  this process and make long-term investments. We receive the support we  need for this from our motivated team: I notice it whenever I talk to  our associates. And this does not just come from my intuition. Our global Employee Survey clearly showed that the team backs the  company, and we have found the right balance between disruption and stability. In 2021, the company achieved all-time highs in important key  figures. And we aim to maintain this financial strength in 2022. Dr Nicolas Peter will now talk about our performance in 2021 in more  detail and present our targets for 2022. We will see each other again here in a bit to discuss our strategic  outlook. This will include a first look at the new 7 Series. Stay tuned. Thank you! Statement Dr Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management, FinancePart II – Statement by Oliver Zipse on strategic outlook Ladies and Gentlemen, The new BMW 7 Series that will be released this year is tech magic at  its best. This is the first time we are fully using our Tech Stack for  driver assistance functions. It will also enable Level 3 highly  automated driving, which we will present before the end of 2022. We developed its sound system with the Hollywood film-score composer  Hans Zimmer. The new 7 Series will be the next ace in our successful growth  strategy in the luxury class. It is the only luxury sedan with true  drivetrain diversity – offered as a BEV, a plug-in hybrid and a modern  combustion engine.The most powerful variant of 7 Series is the fully electric model.  The BMW i7 is part of the success story of how we perceive our role as  a leader.We will remain open to all technologies – as long as there is  customer demand, and it benefits the climate. The new BMW 7 Series  also kicks off the new generation of our highly efficient combustion  engines. It is already geared towards the likely incoming Euro 7  standard legislation.In other words, our conventional drivetrains are already prepared in  accordance with 2030 regulatory requirements. And we have already  covered the main financial expenses for these requirements. On the 20th of April, we will present our new 7 Series for the first  time at its public world premiere. We will also give you a sneak  preview now. Film: Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management, Development. A digital driving experience has played an integral part in mobility  for a long time. For this reason, we are rolling out the BMW iDrive  and our Operating System 8 on a broad scale and in all derivatives. Of course, the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is also equipped with  the latest BMW iDrive – the first vehicle in the premium compact  class. This is how we are transferring technology to smaller vehicle classes. The new level of connectivity, including the 5G standard, brings even  more entertainment to all segments. The same applies to future BMW  models, like the 3 Series and X7 updates, as well as the new XM and  the new X1, with its BEV variant, the iX1. Starting at the end of the year, the new iX1 will be our fully  electric offer to customers in the high-volume premium compact  segment. The X1 also highlights the potential of modern, flexible BMW  architectures with its diversity of different drivetrains – just as  you have experienced with iX and i4. Digitalised mobility primarily needs robust international supply  chains for both software and hardware. The flow of goods around the  world is highly interconnected – as the semiconductor supply  bottlenecks have shown. And this is typical for all key technologies. We build several thousand chips into every vehicle. Now, we are  increasingly relying on direct supply contracts. Film: Dr Joachim Post, Member of the Board of Management, Purchasing  and Supplier Network. The supply chain takes on a whole new meaning with the ramp-up of  e-mobility. We are signing targeted agreements with our suppliers –  for instance, for energy-intensive primary materials like steel and  aluminium. Already today, we have contractually agreed with our  suppliers that by 2030, we will save around 20 million tonnes of  CO2 in the supply chain alone, compared to 2019. In the company internally, we are paying much closer attention to the  increased importance and responsibility of upstream value chain  processes. We have been creating the structures for this and refining  our organisation since the start of the year. This will make the  company significantly faster and more resilient. Today, our Purchasing, Development and Production divisions are  already working very closely together. The Board of Management has  decided that such collaboration should be linked even more closely together. In the future, this will consist of technology clusters. This applies  to the clusters “digital”, “drivetrain”, “driving” and “exterior and  interior”. As part of this process, we will explicitly strengthen the  responsibility of our Purchasing and Supplier Network division. Joachim Post and his team will foster close collaboration with our  development and production as well as our suppliers, forming new  alliances across value chains and regions. We are selective about the companies we work with. This could even be  an innovative start-up if they are the ones developing exactly the  technology we need. In this way, we are able to significantly improve  the transfer of technological innovations into our products, our  development and our production in a targeted, permanent manner. The  same applies to our partners’ contribution to our climate goals for 2030. The global commitment to climate neutrality is bringing the topic of  production back into the public focus. It is, and will remain, one of  BMW’s greatest strengths – something we are able to exploit even more  during the transformation. Film: Dr Milan Nedeljković, Member of the Board of Management, Production. All our plants will become iFactories. Take, for instance, our two “bookends”: our oldest plant in Munich,  and our future plant in Hungary. We are transitioning our plant in  Munich to 100-percent electric during ongoing production. On 1 June,  we will lay the foundation stone for our plant in Debrecen. Already 26  months later, the pre-series for the NEUE KLASSE is set to roll off  the production line. The plant in Hungary is the first representative of both the BMW  iFactory and our new vehicle architecture. Exactly one year after  announcing the NEUE KLASSE, we are right on track. We are once again reinventing ourselves – our products, our  technology and our way of working. 90 percent of the supplier  contracts for the first vehicles will be awarded this year – with  CO2 emissions as part of our selection criteria. I want to  put it clearly: Cool, digitalised products are built in cool,  digitalised plants. In Shenyang, we will be opening a completely new plant at the Tiexi  site this year. Our plant in the Dadong district is also undergoing a  comprehensive expansion. We are using this capacity to produce  additional BEV models in China. This year, we will start producing a  fully electric variant of the BMW 3 series long sedan, tailor-made for  the Chinese market. In addition to this, the BMW X5 is currently No. 1 in its segment  globally. In China, we are expanding our offer of a locally produced  variant of the X5, which has an extra-long wheelbase and added comfort  as the 3 Series. Hydrogen remains relevant for us, alongside electromobility. We see  hydrogen-electric drivetrains as a complement to battery electric  drivetrains. This is the only way our fleet can have a maximum impact  protecting the climate. That is why we support the European  Commission’s plans to expand charging and hydrogen-filling station  infrastructure along European highways. Our BMW iX5 Hydrogen is already in its final stages of development.  We just completed winter testing under extreme conditions. The result:  full range and performance, even under negative 20 degrees Celsius. We  will begin producing a small series in autumn. And we are already  preparing for the next generation of our fuel cell drivetrain. IPCEI  funding would rapidly advance development and industrialisation of  this additional drivetrain generation in Germany. BMW is actually the  only automaker that has committed to produce a vehicle within the  framework of this program. Our technological transformation is a comprehensive, far-reaching  process. And we are taking our people with us. Film: Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management, Human Ressources. We have already trained more than 50,000 employees worldwide on  e-mobility and we are bringing new experts on board for emission-free mobility. Our MINI and Rolls-Royce brands will be all-electric from 2030 onwards. By the end of this year, we will give you a glimpse of the new MINI  family line-up: New models with a remarkable character and the MINI  specific electrified go-cart feeling. Full digitalisation – reflecting  the lifestyle of our MINI customers. And an overall ecological  footprint that is minimal. At BMW Motorrad, all future urban models will be fully electric. BMW  Motorrad has been developing electrified two-wheelers for over ten years. Here, you can see the latest model: the BMW CE 04. The media is  currently testing it. It’s a real eye-catcher and a lot of fun to ride  – especially given how it sprints away from the traffic lights. The next innovative model built for urban mobility will follow in  2023. Customers can expect a new electric two-wheeler from BMW  Motorrad every 18 to 24 months. We are fulfilling our customers’ wishes in all segments – because it  is our customers who ultimately decide whether we continue to be successful. Film: Pieter Nota, Member of the Board of Management, Customer,  Brands, Sales.Flexibility, technological expertise and fantastic products in every  segment – all of this pays off: The BMW brand is back on top of the  global premium segment – and we intend to keep it that way. Our global market share of 3.4 percent is a result of our successful  business operations. All our brands are focused on the customer and  their mobility experience. We are digitalising the customer interface and leveraging digital and  physical options to reach out to customers through all channels. We  are scaling up online-sales. However, our retailers will have an  important and future role as the “point of sales and service”. We see  the premium customer experience, especially in sales and service, as a  potential competitive advantage we want to expand. Ladies and Gentlemen, Standing here next to the BMW iX Flow, I want to share our promise  with you for the CES in January 2023. You can look forward to our  #NextGen and our digital Vision Vehicle, our next vision for mobility  in 2040. I refer to it as a metaverse experience, combining the  physical vehicle and the digital future. Technology will enable emission-free, digitalised, circular mobility.  The BMW Group is in the best position for this – as upcoming  anniversaries this year show. This includes the centenary for BMW Plant Munich, 50th anniversary  for the BMW Hochhaus, and 50 years of BMW M. They all show how we  always look far into the future. 2022 will not be an easy year – that much is certain. However, we  have experience handling challenging situations – and at the same  time, we have always pursued and reached our long-term goals. In order to do this, our world must remain peaceful with the  possibility of free global trade which drives innovation in a  competitive environment. We will do everything in our power to achieve  this. And we are providing help when and wherever it is needed. Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Transformation and responsibility: BMW Group steps up technological change for sustainable future;After a successful 2021, the BMW Group is speeding up technological change and pushing forward with the transformation towards sustainable mobility. The company is preparing for a comprehensive leap in technology in its Neue Klasse and significantly upping the pace once again as it continues to ramp up e-mobility.;" Munich. After a successful 2021, the BMW Group is  speeding up technological change and pushing forward with the  transformation towards sustainable mobility. The company is preparing  for a comprehensive leap in technology in its Neue  Klasse and significantly upping the pace once again    as it continues to ramp up e-mobility. At the same time,  the BMW Group is involving its stakeholders, from employees to the  capital market to society, in its successful, consistently implemented  transformation strategy. “We see 2021 as clear evidence that successful transformation pays  off. The strong result we achieved in financial year 2021 is the  outcome of our consistent strategy – with an open-technology approach  and the right products at the right time,” said Oliver  Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, on  Wednesday in Munich. “We have laid the foundations to build on this  success in the coming years: With the Neue Klasse, we are leading  sustainable mobility into a new technological  dimension. By extending the contract with our BBA joint  venture until 2040, the BMW Group is also taking its growth to the  next level.” The BMW Group is monitoring the current development of the situation  in eastern Europe with great concern and dismay. As a global company,  the BMW Group stands for the peaceful coexistence of different  cultures all over the world – at all times and in all locations. The  thoughts of our BMW Group employees are with all those who are  experiencing suffering and loss in this war. “In the current situation, three things are paramount for the BMW  Group: helping the victims and those affected wherever we can,  securing our day-to-day operations worldwide and continuing to  systematically implement our long-term strategy,” said  Zipse. “The major challenges we are already facing,  such as the fight against climate change and the transformation  towards sustainable mobility, must still be confronted with the same  intensity . It is especially important in times of crisis not to stop  doing the right things.” Employees key success factor in transformation Allstakeholders in the company benefit  from how the BMW Group is approaching the transformation: In response  to the technological shift taking place and continued growth  prospects, the BMW Group plans to add new jobs worldwide this year  that will expand its workforce by to up to five  percent. In this way, the company is contributing to    social prosperity at its locations worldwide.  Current BMW AG employees will see a noticeable increase in their    profit-sharing bonus for 2021, in line with Group  net profit. “The main secret to BMW’s success is our associates: They deserve our  thanks, our respect and our recognition for their achievements in  2021. We all share the same core belief that we at the BMW Group move  people, touch their hearts and inspire their minds. We are working  together to continue this success in the future,” said Zipse. Nicolas Peter, member of the Board of Management of  BMW AG responsible for Finance, adds: “Our workforce also benefits  from the success of the company: Last autumn, for instance, we once  again expanded the preferred stock programme introduced in 1989 that  allows employees to buy shares in the company on favourable terms.” Environment also benefits: CO2 fleet emissions once again    significantly reduced The environment is another key stakeholder for the  BMW Group and also benefits from the course taken by the company:  Based on preliminary calculations, the BMW Group reported an    EU fleet emissions figure of 115.9 grams of CO2 per  kilometre and therefore once again significantly  overfulfilled its CO2 fleet target of 126 g/km. 2021 was also  the first year in which the BMW Group’s entire production and all its  sites worldwide achieved a net zero carbon footprint. In 2021, the company became the first German automotive manufacturer  to join the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign launched by the Science-Based Targets  Initiative and therefore committed to the goal of complete    climate neutrality throughout the entire value chain by    2050 at the latest. To take account of all aspects  of holistic sustainability, the BMW Group aims to  significantly increase the percentage of secondary material used in  its vehicles. The ""Secondary First""  approach seeks to gradually expand the percentage of recycled and  reused materials used from the current average of almost 30 percent to    50 percent in the Neue Klasse. The    BMW i Vision Circular already provided a glimpse of  what individual, sustainable, luxurious mobility in the urban  environment could look like in 2040:    built from 100-percent secondary material and  renewable raw materials – and 100-percent recyclable. All BMW AG shareholders also have the opportunity to  participate in the company’s success during the transformation: The  Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose a  dividend of 5.80 euros per share of common stock  (preferred stock: 5.82 euros) for the financial year 2021 to the  Annual General Meeting. This represents a payout ratio of 30.7%. “The higher dividend allows our shareholders to benefit from the  company’s strong performance last year. Appropriate participation in  the company’s success is important to us. We will continue to apply  sound judgement, remaining equally focused on the successful,  sustainable development of the company and our shareholders’  expectations. Even in times of high volatility, amid the challenges of  a far-reaching transformation, we are still optimising our company’s  profitability and enabling our shareholders to benefit from it to an  appropriate extent,” said Peter. Majority stake in joint venture BBA will boost electric    offering in China Another important element in the future orientation of the company is  the extension of the contract with the BMW Brilliance  Automotive (BBA) joint venture in China, combined with  acquisition of a majority stake. Since February, the BMW Group has  held 75 percent of the shares in the company, which  has since been fully consolidated in the Group Financial Statements of  BMW AG. “A successful global company must be able to thoroughly understand  and fulfil customers’ needs and wishes in all three main    regions of the world. With our new footprint in China, we  will be able to meet this requirement to the same extent in all  regions,” said Zipse. One of the ways in which the  BMW Group will achieve this is by expanding its range of    fully-electric vehicles in the world’s    largest market for e-mobility and launching production this  year of a fully-electric variant of the BMW 3 Series    Long-Wheelbase Version that has been specially customised  for China. The company has already announced that the BMW  X5 range will also be expanded to include a variant produced  locally in China. Strong free cash flow expected – share repurchase    authorisation to be proposed to Annual General Meeting Based on its strong operating performance during the  transformation and confidence in the company’s continued  success, the BMW Group is setting itself ambitious targets  for free cash flow: For 2022, the BMW Group  expects free cash flow in the Automotive  Segment to reach at least seven billion euros. In addition,  there will be a positive one-time effect from recognising BBA’s liquid  assets in the balance sheet for the first time amounting to  approximately 5 billion euros. Payment of the acquisition price of  around 3.7 billion euros in February has already been considered. Thanks to its successful business development, the BMW Group has a    healthy balance sheet and a very  solid financing structure, with the potential to generate    sustainably high free cash flow. One reason for  this is the recent full consolidation of BBA in the BMW Group  Financial Statements. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board  will propose to the Annual General Meeting that the Board of  Management be authorised, among other things, to purchase and    retire treasury shares. In accordance with the legal  framework, the Board of Management would be authorised for a period of  five years to purchase shares in the company worth up to ten percent  of the total share capital and to retire or to use them. Innovation drives demand: BMW Group steps up technological    change and e-mobility ramp-up significantly Validated by the success of its fully-electric models so far, the BMW  Group is also raising its targets for the e-mobility ramp-up:    This year, including pre-production vehicles, the  company will already have 15 fully-electric models in  production – covering around 90 percent of its    current segments. In addition to existing models like the    BMW i4, BMW iX and MINI  SE*, this also includes four high-volume BMW model  series: the BMW 3 Series and BMW 5  Series, the BMW X1 and the  BMW X3. The new BMW 7 Series also  has a special role to play in 2022, with the launch of the new    BMW i7. “The BMW iX and BMW i4 are probably the best    electric cars on the market currently –  the test reviews and strong demand from our customers speak for  themselves. This year, the BMW i7 will take things to the next level,”  said Zipse. With the introduction of the BMW iX and BMW i4, the BMW Group has  significantly expanded its digitalisation of the customer  interface. For instance, as well as offering intuitive  configuration to simplify the purchasing process, pre-configured new  vehicles and newer used cars across the entire model range can already  be bought online in the BMW Group’s domestic market of Germany. By  2025, the company plans to sell around a    quarter of its vehicles entirely online. Furthermore, data-based recognition of service requirements enables    proactive customer care. This means the customer can be contacted  directly and receive assistance remotely, wherever possible, or a  visit to the workshop can be set up easily and efficiently, if needed. Two million BEVs on roads by end of 2025 With a fast-growing range of products and strong  demand for the new electric models already available, like  the BMW iX and BMW i4, the BMW Group expects sales of its  fully-electric vehicles to increase rapidly: By the end of  2025, the company aims to have more than two million    fully-electric vehicles on the roads. With the addition of the BMW i7, the BMW 7 Series  will become the first fully-electric luxury sedan in  our line-up available with either an internal combustion engine or a  plug-in hybrid drive train. At the same time, the new BMW 7 Series  also comes with next-level internal combustion and plug-in hybrid  drive technology. This new generation of diesel and petrol    engines offers higher efficiency. Its development already  ensured that engine technology is taking a further step towards  reducing emissions and improving air quality. At the same time, it is  also technically enabled for future regulatory requirements. Neue Klasse brings leap in technology: new battery generation    and future of connectivity The BMW Group will be realigning its product range from the middle of  the decade with the introduction of the Neue Klasse.  Based on a vehicle architecture (BEV-only) that is uncompromisingly  geared towards electric drive trains, the Neue Klasse is characterised  by three key aspects: an entirely redefined IT and software  architecture, a newly-developed high-performance    electric drive train and battery generation, and a  new level of sustainability throughout the entire lifecycle. This new dimension of product substance is designed  to set the standard for digitalisation and electrification, while  bringing the characteristics of a typical BMW into the future –  thereby giving rapidly growing demand for  fully-electric BMW Group vehicles a further boost. To achieve this, the company is making a major technological  leap: For example, the Neue Klasse will use an all-new  electric drive train with lower fuel consumption and higher  range. The BMW Group is currently developing a new generation  of battery cells for this that, combined with optimised cell  chemistry, should also significantly lower costs for the e-drive. The company plans to announce details of this new battery technology  – which is already the sixth generation independently developed by the  BMW Group – before the end of 2022. Within the    next 12 months, the BMW Group will also provide a  first glimpse of the potential of the Neue Klasse for  the next generation of connectivity and user interaction. The long-term cooperation between the BMW Group and Qualcomm  Technologies and Arriver Software agreed on 10 March marks an  important milestone for the next platform generation for automated  driving. The aim is to create a scalable platform for automated  driving where development is based on a common reference architecture,  with joint sensor specifications and a shared safety architecture.  More than 1,400 specialists at locations around the world will work  together within this cooperation. 50 percent BEV share may be possible before 2030 The BMW Group believes the Neue Klasse has the potential to further  speed up the market penetration of e-mobility. For example,    fully-electric vehiclescould make up50 percent of the company’s global sales earlierthan2030. By this point, annual sales of fully-electric BMW Group vehicles  could already surpass 1.5 million units. However,  this will depend on expansion of charging infrastructure worldwide  being able to keep up with the increase in models available and  growing customer demand for fully-electric vehicles. The company is  driving this expansion itself – for example, through the high-power  charging network, Ionity. A stable supply of raw materials will also  be key. Under these conditions, the BMW Group aims to have delivered a total  of ten million fully-electric vehicles to customers    by 2030. By then, the Rolls-Royce  brand will have a product range that is    exclusively all-electric. MINI is also on the road  to a fully-electric future from the early 2030s onwards. Later this  year, the brand will provide a glimpse of the all-new MINI family:  fully digitalised, to suit the MINI lifestyle – with electrified  go-kart feeling, a clear focus on sustainability and a minimal  environmental footprint. The BMW Group does not expect all markets worldwide to have the    necessary framework conditions in place for all  customers to transition to pure electromobility in the early 2030s.  For this reason, options with highly efficient conventional drive  technology will still be needed to meet people’sindividual mobility requirements, while at the same  time contributing to CO2 reduction in the transport sector. Hydrogen fuel cell as further pillar of drive technology Hydrogen fuel cell technology is also expected to  account for a growing percentage of the drive train mix from the  second half of the decade onwards. The BMW Group is systematically  pushing forward with development of this technology as an additional  option for sustainable individual mobility and has already announced  that an electric drive train based on a hydrogen fuel cell is also  conceivable for the Neue Klasse. A small series of the BMW iX5  Hydrogen will be used for demonstration and testing purposes  for the first time this year. With its high-performance fuel cell and  optimised power battery, the BMW iX5 Hydrogen’s drive  system is one-of-a-kind worldwide. Assuming  the hydrogen is produced using renewable energy and  the necessaryinfrastructure is available, this technology can  complement the BMW Group’s drive train portfolio and, in particular,  meet the needs of customers who do not have their own access to    electric charging infrastructure, frequently drive  long distances and desire a high degree of flexibility. BMW iFactory: Lean, green, digital – production of the future for Neue Klasse The Neue Klasse is not only designed to set standards on the roads,  but also in production. The BMW Group has viewed itself for decades as  the benchmark for production technology and  operational excellence in vehicle construction. Building on this  foundation, the company now aims to redefine the future of automotive  production: BMW iFACTORY represents this strategic vision of BMW  production: LEAN. GREEN. DIGITAL. BMW iFACTORY provides answers to the challenges of transforming the  production network towards e-mobility, with a global, integrative  approach, and will be implemented at all plants worldwide. This    digitalised iFactory approach will be pioneered by  the new Plant Debrecen, with  groundbreaking planned for 1 June 2022. Exactly 26  months later, the plant will produce the first prototypes for the Neue  Klasse. Existing locations such as the main plant in  Munich, which will celebrate its centenary  this year, will be modernised from the same perspective, as part of  the ongoing transformation, and geared up for future tasks. In the clusters lean, green, digital, the BMW Group  will be systematically further developing its global production  network in the coming years to fulfil its ambition of creating the    most state-of-the-art and efficientproduction for the Neue Klasse. The term lean stands for efficiency,    precision and a high level of flexibility, as well as the  ability to integrate different drive technologies and vehicle  architectures into production – which is already a key factor for the  lasting success of the transformation. Green means using state-of-the-art technologies to  establish production with minimal use of resources  and the vision of a circular economy. By 2030, the  BMW Group aims to reduce its CO2 emissions per vehicle from production  by 80 percent from 2019 levels. Digital stands for the use of data  science and artificial intelligence in  production, as well as merging the real and virtual  world in planning and development. The aim is for employees  around the world to be able to connect virtually in real time to shape  the production of the future. “We are making good progress with the comprehensive digitalisation of  the company and its products, and the gradual electrification of our  line-up. We are able to cover the high investments we are making out  of our own resources, today and in the future. We have the staying  power and the financial strength for this far-reaching  transformation,” said Peter. Operational excellence – the basis for continued success The BMW Group brought the financial year 2021 to a successful  conclusion – with Group revenues, earnings and net profit all  significantly higher.Deliveries were up 8.4%, to    2,521,514 units, of which 13% were electrified  vehicles (328,314 units/ +70.4% YOY). Group revenues climbed to €111,239 million (prev. yr.: € 98,990 million) in  2021. A higher percentage of high-revenue vehicles meant the BMW Group  benefited from positive product-mix effects and improved pricing –  both for the sale of new vehicles and the resale of end-of-lease vehicles. For the full year, the BMW Group reported Group earnings before taxes of    € 16,060 million (prev. yr.: €  5,222 million). A positive effect of around € 1 billion resulted from  the partial reversal of the provision for the EU Commission’s  antitrust proceedings, after these were concluded in the second  quarter. Higher research and development spending  provides an indication of how the BMW Group is consistently driving  forward with its transformation. Total costs for research and  development in accordance with IFRS increased significantly  year-on-year to € 6,299 million (prev. yr.: € 5,689 million). Despite  this, Group net profit reached a new all-time high of    € 12,463 million (prev. yr.: € 3,857 million).    Employee numbers stood at 118,909 at the end of  December 2021 (prev. yr.: 120,726). EBIT margin in Automotive Segment for 2021 at high end of guidance In the Automotive Segment, earnings before financial  result (EBIT) amounted to € 9,870 million  (prev. yr.: € 2,162 million). At 10.3% (2020: 2.7%),  the EBIT margin for the segment was therefore at the  high end of our guidance. The Financial Services Segment also benefited from  continuing high demand for new and used premium vehicles.    Pre-tax earnings totalled €3,753 million (prev. yr.: € 1,725 million) and were  therefore also significantly higher than the previous year. The need  for value adjustments for credit risks remained low – which also had a  positive effect. BMW Motorrad delivered more motorcycles and scooters  to customers in 2021 than ever before, with 194,261  units (prev. yr.: 169,272) sold. The segment posted  revenues of € 2,748 million (prev.  yr.: € 2,284 million) and an EBIT of € 227  million (prev. yr.: € 103 million). The EBIT  margin came in at 8.3% (prev. yr.: 4.5%) and  is therefore within the guidance corridor of 8-10%. “The BMW Group’s financial statements have once again proven its  financial strength and flexibility. They show that we are managing our  business prudently and with a clear focus, and staying the course,  even in extremely volatile times. Our goal, once again this year, is  to maintain a consistently strong performance. Operationally, we are  well-positioned for this. The fact that our workforce is highly  motivated and able to weather a crisis makes me optimistic for 2022,  despite the difficult conditions,” said Peter. Outlook for 2022: Group earnings before taxes expected to    increase significantly The BMW Group will continue to enhance the operational excellence of  its day-to-day business in 2022 to maintain its success, even in  difficult conditions. The company’s products are in high demand  worldwide – both models with electrified drive trains and those with  conventional technology. At the same time, the geopolitical situation  in eastern Europe is leading to restrictions in the BMW Group  production network. Without these negative effects, year-on-year    deliveries in the AutomotiveSegment would have been expected to trend slightly  higher. Due to the foreseeable adjustments to production,    deliveries are now projected to be on a par    with last year. The full consolidation of BBA will affect key BMW  Group performance indicators for the financial year 2022: Automotive  Segment revenues and EBIT will increase significantly, due to the full  consolidation. However, in combination with consolidation effects,  this is not expected to have a significant impact on the EBIT margin  in the Automotive Segment for the financial year 2022. Without the  impact of the war in Ukraine, the BMW Group would have targeted a  range of 8-10%. However, taking into account the negative effects of  adjustments to production, the EBIT margin is now  forecast to be between 7-9%. This outlook already assumes that the impact of the geopolitical  situation in eastern Europe will lead to restrictions in the BMW Group  production network over the coming weeks. The company is engaging in  intense and constructive discussions with its partners and suppliers  and leveraging the high level of flexibility in its production network  to minimise these limitations. This also involves these suppliers’  production locations worldwide. In parallel, the BMW Group continues  to source parts from West Ukraine, thereby securing long-term  prospects for those employees. However, the safety of local employees  remains the top priority throughout all these activities. A slight increase in deliveries is  forecast for the Motorcycles Segment. The EBIT margin  should remain within our target range of 8 to 10%. The performance  indicators for the Motorcycles Segment will be only marginally  affected by the full consolidation of BMW Brilliance. In the Financial Services Segment, we expect RoE to  be between 14 and 17%. Compared to reporting year 2021, the strong  positive effects from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles are expected  to normalise in the second half of the year, as the semiconductor  supply situation improves. As a result of the full consolidation of BMW Brilliance,    Group earnings before taxes should increase  significantly during the forecast period. The decisive factor here  will be the inclusion of the BMW Brilliance operating result in the  Automotive Segment and the revaluation of previously held equity  interests, with a positive effect of approx. 7-8 billion euros in the  financial result. These effects would more than offset the elimination  of BMW Brilliance’s at-equity earnings in the financial result and the  negative impact resulting from effects in connection with the full  consolidation. Even taking into account the negative impact of  production adjustments, Group earnings before taxes  are still expected to see significant growth. To enable it to press forward with technological change and leverage  further growth prospects, the company will be hiring new  employees this year. The BMW Group plans to increase its  workforce worldwide by up to five  percent in 2022 (reporting date 31 Dec. 2021). Not included in this forecast are: significant tightening of the  sanctions against Russia and/or changes in how existing sanctions are  interpreted, the conflict spreading outside of Ukraine, or a further  substantial increase in energy and raw material prices – due to the  war in Ukraine and/or as a result of related sanctions, among other factors. Regardless of this, the situation remains extremely dynamic, making  it difficult to provide accurate guidance for the financial year 2022.  Since it is not possible to assess further potential longer-term  implications of the war in Ukraine at this time, this cannot be  factored into our forecast. International demand for semiconductors is likely to remain high,  with a correspondingly difficult supply situation. As in 2021, there  is still a risk of supply bottlenecks for the semiconductor components  required for in-house production. The situation is not currently  expected to improve until the second half of 2022. * * * The BMW Group – an overview20212020Change in %Deliveries to customersAutomotive1units2,521,5142,325,1798.4thereof:         BMW2units2,213,7902,028,8419.1 MINI2units302,138292,5823.3 Rolls-Royce2units5,5863,75648.7Motorcyclesunits194,261169,27214.8     Employees                                                        (compared to 31 Dec. 2020)118,909120,726-1.5     Automotive Segment          EBIT marginpercent10.32.7+7.6% pointsMotorcycles          Segment EBIT marginpercent8.34.5+3.8% pointsEBT margin BMW Group3percent14.45.3+9.1% points     Revenues€ million111,23998,99012.4thereof:          Automotive€ million95,47680,85318.1Motorcycles€ million2,7482,28420.3Financial        Services€        million32,86730,0449.4Other        Entities€        million5366.7Eliminations€ million– 19,857-14,19439.9     Profit before financial result        (EBIT)€ million13,4004,830177.4thereof:          Automotive€ million9,8702,162356.5Motorcycles€ million227103120.4Financial        Services€        million3,7011,721115.0Other        Entities€        million-836-Eliminations€ million-390808-     Profit before tax (EBT)€ million16,0605,222207.5thereof:          Automotive€ million11,8052,722333.7Motorcycles€ million228100128.0Financial        Services€        million3,7531,725117.6Other        Entities€        million531-235-Eliminations€ million-257910-     Income taxes€ million– 3,597– 1,365-Net profit2€ million12,4633,857223.1Earnings per share(common/preferred share) €18.77/18.795.73/5.75-1 Including Joint Venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.,  Shenyang (2021: 651,236 vehicles, 2020: 602,247 vehicles, 2019:  538,612 vehicles, 2018: 455,581 vehicles, 2017: 385,705 vehicles).2 Retail vehicle delivery data presented for 2020 and 2021  is not directly comparable to such data presented for previous years.

BMW Group, Qualcomm and Arriver to form long-lasting strategic cooperation for joint development of Automated Driving software solutions;BMW Group, Qualcomm Technologies, and Arriver join forces to co-develop next generation of Automated Driving Systems. The cooperation combines BMW’s current AD stack with Arriver’s Vision Perception and NCAP Drive Policy products on Qualcomm Technologies’ system-on-chip, with the goal of designing best-in-class Automated Driving functions spanning NCAP, Level 2 and Level 3.  ;Munich. BMW Group, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and  Arriver Software AB announced a long-term development cooperation for  the development of Automated Driving technologies. The companies  signed an agreement for a strategic cooperation, which will focus on  joint development of next-generation AD technologies ranging from New  Car Assessment Program (NCAP), Level 2 Advanced Driving Assistance  Systems to Level 3 High Automated Driving functionalities. The  co-development of software functions is based on the current BMW  Automated Driving software stack first launched with the BMW iX in  2021, which will be further extended in the next generation through  this cooperation. In November 2021 the companies announced that BMW’s  next generation Automated Driving System will be ported on the  Snapdragon Ride™ Vision system-on-chip (SoC) including Arriver  Computer Vision and the Snapdragon Ride Platform’s compute SoC  controllers managed by Snapdragon® Car-to-Cloud Services platform. The efforts will focus on creating a scalable platform for Automated  Driving based on a common reference architecture, sensor-set  specifications, and safety requirements with joint development,  toolchain, and a data center for storage, reprocessing, and  simulation.

Expanding the portfolio: BMW Group acquires the ALPINA brand;Pieter Nota: “Top-quality car cachet”  Long-term future of ALPINA brand secured  Andreas Bovensiepen: “This marks the beginning of a new chapter for ALPINA and BOVENSIEPEN”  Existing cooperation agreement expires at end of 2025  New direction at Buchloe site  ;Munich. The BMW Group welcomes a new addition to its  portfolio, as the ALPINA brand becomes part of the company. The BMW  Group will secure the rights to the ALPINA brand – bringing even  greater diversity to its own luxury-car range. BMW AG and ALPINA  Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG have reached an agreement to this  effect that will secure the long-term future of the ALPINA brand as  well as the Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH und Co. KG. The conclusion of the transaction is still subject to various  suspensive conditions – in particular, approval by the responsible  antitrust authorities. The long-standing cooperation agreement, which  was extended for another five years in late 2020, will expire on 31  Dec. 2025. Both parties have agreed not to disclose any financial  details. No shares in the company will be acquired. Over half a century, BMW and the small-series manufacturer from  Buchloe, outside of Munich, have forged a close cooperation built on  the highest level of trust. Now, the transformation of the automotive  industry enters a new chapter. “The automotive industry is in the midst of a far-reaching  transformation towards sustainable mobility. For that reason, existing  business models need to be re-examined on a regular basis. For over  fifty years, the Buchloe firm has demon­strated how to deliver  top-quality car cachet through meticulous attention to detail. The BMW  Group is also driven by this same passion for cars that capture the  imagination. That is why we are now embarking on a new chapter in our  long-standing partnership. Acquiring the trademark rights will allow  us to shape the long-term course of this brand steeped in tradition.  We are delighted to welcome the ALPINA brand to the BMW family,” said  Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management responsible for  Customer, Brands and Sales. The transformation towards electromobility and increasing regulation  worldwide – particularly emissions legislation, software validation  and requirements for driver assistance and monitoring systems – result  in significantly higher risks for small-series manufacturers. The  management of ALPINA Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG is addressing  this with a strategic realignment that will secure the long-term  viability of the Buchloe operations. Andreas Bovensiepen, co-managing director of ALPINA Burkard  Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG, explains: “We recognised the challenges  facing the automotive industry early on and are now setting the right  course for ALPINA and for our family firm, BOVENSIEPEN. This marks the  beginning of a new chapter. Both the ALPINA brand and our company are  extremely desirable. We made a conscious decision not to sell ALPINA  to just any manufacturer, because BMW and ALPINA have worked together  and trusted one another for decades. That is why it is the right  decision strategically for the ALPINA brand to be managed by the BMW  Group in the future.” The cooperation will continue – but in a different form: The company  owned by the Bovensiepen family will continue to use its engineering  expertise in developing, manufacturing, and selling BMW ALPINA  vehicles within the existing cooperation until the end of 2025. This  results in base BMW cars receiving extensive modifi­cation by the  ALPINA team - including the engine and transmission, as well as the  chassis, aerodynamics, and interior equipment. BMW ALPINA vehicles are  pre-assembled on BMW production lines before final assembly of the  vehicles taking place in workshops in Buchloe, also comprising  individual interiors built to customer specifications. The service, parts and accessories business for the existing and  legacy BMW ALPINA vehicle portfolio will continue at the Buchloe  location in the long term. There will be no changes to the existing  aftersales cooperation. As part of a strategic cooperation between the  two companies, there will be a further expansion of the existing  development services business for BMW out of Buchloe. The wine  business that also forms part of the family firm will be unaffected. “BMW and ALPINA are a perfect fit! The ALPINA brand has matured  alongside BMW over the past 50 years and has everything it takes to  make the heart of an automotive connoisseur beat faster all over the  world. It finds the right balance between cultivated sportiness,  luxury, and exclusivity. We are delighted to acquire the trademark  rights to ALPINA and add new vehicle capturing DNA to the BMW  portfolio,” said Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President Customer and  Brand BMW. 2021 was the most successful year in the history of ALPINA Burkard  Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG. Building on this strong foundation, the  family business will strategically realign going forwards in order to  address regulatory challenges and technological change in the  industry. This will secure the location of Buchloe for the long term. “We will continue our father’s life’s work and invest in the equally  well-known name of BOVENSIEPEN. With our expertise and high standards  of quality, we will bring other convincing mobile offerings to the  market in the future,” explains co-managing director Florian  Bovensiepen: “Without our creative, highly capable, and loyal  employees, ALPINA’s success story would not have been possible. We are  relying on the strength of our company, our team, and our families to  pivot at the right time. At the same time, we acknowledge, with the  BMW Group, our social responsibility towards our workforce and will do  our best to cushion the potential impact resulting from this reorganisation.” The sale of trademark rights to BMW and the resulting discontinuation  of the current ALPINA vehicle programme at the end of 2025 will have  implications for existing jobs at the Buchloe site. BMW will support  ALPINA with the necessary adjustments to the workforce at the Buchloe  location over the coming years. Up until the end of 2025, BMW will  work with ALPINA to offer those employees who will not be able to  continue working at the Buchloe site a new position with the BMW Group  and also help them find new jobs with suppliers and development partners. ALPINA Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG, a German vehicle  manufacturer based in Buchloe, was officially founded on 1 January  1965. ALPINA was active in BMW tuning and motorsports from the 1960s  onwards and began manufacturing passenger cars based on BMW AG  products in 1978. Since 1983, the company based in Buchloe in the  Ostallgäu district of Bavaria has been registered as an official  automotive manufacturer with the German Federal Motor Transport  Authority in Flensburg and employs around 300 people. Around 2,000  vehicles were produced in Buchloe in 2021. In addition to Germany and  Europe, Japan, the US, and the Middle East are also important markets  for ALPINA. The family company’s second main area of activity is the  ALPINA wine business. If you have any questions, please contact: BMW Group Corporate Communications Jörg Kottmeier, Communications CorporateTelephone: +49-89-382-23401Email: joerg.kottmeier@bmw.de Eckhard Wannieck, Head of Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesTelephone: +49 89 382-24544E-mail: Eckhard.Wannieck@bmwgroup.com Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comE-mail: presse@bmwgroup.com  The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

BMW Group significantly increases Group earnings and net profit;Group EBT: € 16 billion  2021 EBIT margin of 10.3% at high end of guidance range  Free cash flow (automotive): € 6,354 million  CO2 emissions of EU new vehicle fleet significantly reduced to 115.9 g/km (WLTP)  Dividend of € 5.80 per share of common stock proposed  Share repurchase authorisation will be proposed to Annual General Meeting  Zipse: “Successful transformation due to employee performance”  ;Munich. In a challenging environment, the BMW Group  ended the financial year 2021 strong and fulfilled its targets as  forecast. The premium manufacturer was able to significantly increase  both Group earnings and net profit compared to the previous year,  having already raised its guidance in May and September. Valuation  effects and reversals contributed to this improvement. The BMW Group  also met high expectations for its non-financial targets: For example,  in financial year 2021, the percentage of total deliveries from  electrified vehicles increased significantly to 13%. As well, the CO2  emissions value of the BMW Group’s EU new vehicle fleet was reduced to  115.9 g/km (WLTP).The company has stepped up electrification of its product range,  while considerably enhancing its profitability.“The past year provides clear evidence that successful transformation  bears fruit. The strong earnings we achieved in financial year 2021  are the result of our consistent strategy – with the right products at  the right time,” said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the  Board of Management of BMW AG, on Thursday in Munich. “This success is  also thanks to our associates, and I would especially like to thank  them for their hard work and their passion. Together, we are  demonstrating that bold transformation and economic success go hand in  hand at BMW.” High Group earnings for financial year 2021  The BMW Group ended the financial year 2021 with all-time highs for  Group revenues, earnings and net profit – all of which were  significantly higher.Deliveries were up 8.4%, to    2,521,514 units, of which 13% were electrified  vehicles (328,314 units/ +70.4% YOY). Group revenues climbed to € 111,239 million (prev. yr.: € 98,990 million/  +12.4%). With a higher percentage of high-revenue vehicles, the BMW  Group benefited from positive product-mix effects and improved pricing  – both for the sale of new vehicles and the resale of end-of-lease  vehicles. Lower year-on-year employee numbers and modernisation of the  pension scheme for employees in Germany resulted in a lower cost of  sales in the high three-digit million euro range. However, this was  partially offset by higher expenses for performance-based remuneration  in the cost of sales. Further headwinds resulted from higher raw  material prices. E-mobility and digitalisation drive R&D costs  Higher research and development spending is an indication that the  BMW Group is consistently driving forward with its transformation.  Total costs for research and development in  accordance with IFRS increased significantly year-on-year to € 6,299 million (prev. yr.: € 5,689 million/ +10.7%).  Higher revenues meant the R&D ratio, according to  the German Commercial Code, of 6.2% remained on a par  with the previous year (prev. yr.: 6.3%). In 2021, investments were  channelled into new vehicle architectures and toolkits in connection  with the electro-offensive. Additional expenses came from the  development of digital products and automated driving. Capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment and    other intangible assets amounted to € 5,012  million in 2021 (2020: € 3,922 million/ +27.8%). The major  expansion of the electrified product line-up and upcoming series  launches led to corresponding capital expenditure at the plants  involved. The capex ratio of 4.5%  was within the target range of <5% as planned.The BMW Group reported earnings before financial  result for the full year of € 13,400 million (prev. yr.: € 4,830 million/ +177.4%).    Group earnings before tax also saw a strong  increase, reaching an all-time high of € 16,060  million (prev. yr.: € 5,222 million/ +207.5%). A positive  effect of around € 1 billion resulted from the partial reversal of the  provision for the EU Commission’s antitrust proceedings, after these  were concluded in the second quarter. Group net profit also reached a new all-time high of    € 12,463 million (prev. yr.: € 3,857 million/ +223.1%). Dividend to increase proportionallyShareholders should also participate to an appropriate extent in the  success of the company. Based on the annual financial statements of  BMW AG, the unappropriated profit (according to the German Commercial  Code) for distribution to shareholders amounts to €3,827 million (prev. yr.: € 1,253 million/ +205.4%).  While maintaining the target range of 30-40% for the payout ratio, the  Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose a  dividend of € 5.80 per share    of common stock (prev. yr.: € 1.90) and €5.82  per share of preferred stock  (prev. yr.: € 1.92) to the Annual General Meeting on 11 May. The  payout ratio amounts to 30.7% (prev. yr.: 32.5%). “We intend to keep our promise of enabling shareholders to  participate in the company’s success at a reliable and commensurate  level. With a payout ratio of 30.7%, our shareholders will also be  able to benefit from a strong financial year 2021,” said    Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management of  BMW AG, Finance. EBIT margin of Automotive Segment at 10.3% The Automotive Segment benefited from better pricing  and an improved product mix in 2021, as demand remained high. Due to  the global semiconductor shortage, fewer new vehicles were available  on the market and high-revenue models were preferred. Positive  residual value development for end-of-lease vehicles – especially in  the US and the UK – also contributed to higher segment income.  Increased business from new parts and accessories also lifted revenues.As a result, segment revenues were significantly  higher, at €95,476 million (prev. yr.: € 80,853 million/ +18.1%).Earnings before financial result (EBIT) amounted to    € 9,870 million (prev. yr.: € 2,162 million/  +356.5%).

Into the 2022 DTM season with strong BMW M Motorsport partners: Designs revealed for the four BMW M4 GT3s.;We have known for a number of weeks that Walkenhorst Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport will each run two BMW M4 GT3s in the 2022 DTM. It is now time to unveil the designs of the four cars. ;Munich. We have known for a number of weeks that Walkenhorst    Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport will each run two BMW M4 GT3s in    the 2022 DTM. It is now time to unveil the designs of the four cars.    Each one bears the colours and logos of long-term BMW M Motorsport    partners who have remained true to the DTM in its GT3 era and play a    valuable role in supporting the BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers    in this prestigious series.BMW M Motorsport thanks CATL, iQOO, PUMA, RoboMarkets,    Schaeffler and Shell.    “The face of the DTM may have changed after the end of the Class 1  era, but it has not lost any of its appeal when it comes to race  action, the impressive number of competitors signed up for this  season, and the high-class field of teams and drivers,” said Timo  Resch, Vice President Customer, Brand and Sales at BMW M GmbH. “I am  thrilled that, as we do, our long-term BMW M Motorsport partners  continue to recognise the huge potential of the DTM platform and have  decided to support the BMW M Motorsport teams – Walkenhorst Motorsport  and Schubert Motorsport – in 2022. I really like all the BMW M4 GT3  designs. They will be real eye-catchers in a large field. Thank you to  all the partners for their support!” Two-time DTM champion Marco Wittmann (GER) will once again be at the  wheel of the ‘Green Machine’ for Walkenhorst Motorsport. The striking  green in the livery has been the trademark of Schaeffler and Wittmann  since the 2019 DTM season. The BMW M4 GT3 now follows in the footsteps  of the BMW M4 DTM and the BMW M6 GT3 as the ‘Green Machine’. His  team-mate at Walkenhorst Motorsport, Esteban Muth (BEL), will drive a  BMW M4 GT3 adorned with the logos of BMW M Motorsport partners CATL  and iQOO. “Schaeffler is looking forward to the continuation of a long and  successful partnership with BMW M Motorsport and, it goes without  saying, to seeing our Schaeffler brand ambassador Marco Wittmann back  on the grid for Walkenhorst Motorsport in the ‘Green Machine’, said  Sören Zinner, Director Sponsoring at Schaeffler. “Nowadays, it is hard  to imagine Schaeffler without the partnership with Marco. We are  certainly expecting an exciting DTM season in the new BMW M4 GT3 with  Schaeffler technology.” As he did in the Class 1 era of the DTM, Sheldon van der Linde again  competes in Shell colours for Schubert Motorsport. As Premium  Technology Partner, Shell was heavily involved in the development of  the BMW M4 GT3. The car driven by van der Linde’s team-mate Philipp  Eng (AUT) features the RoboMarkets livery, which will also be familiar  from the BMW M4 DTM in the Class 1 era. PUMA is Official Supplier of  BMW M Motorsport race wear. “Shell is proud to continue our long-standing Premium Technology  Partnership with BMW M Motorsport in DTM, enabling us to deepen our  R&D collaboration with high-performance at its core”, said Marc  Bittner, Shell’s General Manager European OEMs. “Shell has been  working alongside BMW M Motorsport engineers in DTM to formulate a  Shell Helix Ultra race lubricant for use in the new BMW M4 GT3,  delivering long-lasting and improved engine performance and  efficiency. The learnings taken from this extreme testbed help to  develop new products and technologies, for the benefit of everyday  motorists on the road. Shell welcomes back Sheldon van der Linde to  once again race in our colours of Shell for Schubert Motorsport, and  we wish the team all the best for the new season.” The 2022 DTM season gets underway on 30th April with the  opening race at Portimão (POR). Prior to this, official tests will  take place at Hockenheim (GER) and Portimão.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CO2-free driving pleasure in all weather conditions: The BMW iX5 Hydrogen in final winter testing close to the Arctic Circle.; Hydrogen fuel cell technology also enables unrestricted sustainable mobility in extremely low outside temperatures  Integrated application of drive system, chassis and electronics at the BMW Group’s winter testing centre in Arjeplog, Sweden ;Munich/Arjeplog. The BMW iX5 Hydrogen is currently  undergoing a demanding programme of testing in extremely challenging  weather conditions. It is all part of final winter testing for the car  on public roads and at the BMW Group’s testing centre in Arjeplog,  northern Sweden. The integrated functional testing and validation of  the fuel cell system, hydrogen tanks, peak power battery and central  vehicle control unit have confirmed that this additional  CO2-free mobility option can also be relied on to provide  sustainable driving pleasure with high levels of comfort and  unrestricted performance in extreme sub-zero temperatures.The tests close to the Arctic Circle see the BMW Group pressing ahead  with its development process for the BMW iX5 Hydrogen. The company  will produce a small series of the model later in the year and is also  committed to helping expand the network of hydrogen fuelling stations.  “The winter testing under extreme conditions clearly shows that the  BMW iX5 Hydrogen can also deliver full performance in temperatures of  -20°C and therefore represents a viable alternative to a vehicle  powered by a battery-electric drive system,” says Frank Weber,    Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development.  “For us to be able to offer our customers a fuel cell drive system as  an attractive sustainable mobility solution, a sufficiently extensive  hydrogen infrastructure also needs to be in place.”BMW iX5 Hydrogen: hallmark BMW dynamics, range and everyday    usability all year round.In these test runs on the  ice and snow around Arjeplog, the BMW iX5 Hydrogen is busy  demonstrating how reliably, comfortably and powerfully its hydrogen  fuel cell drive system can already meet the mobility requirements of  everyday life. After racking up hundreds of sessions on test rigs and  in-depth field testing on the road, this adds another chapter to its  development story.The evidence is there for all to see: here, in this extreme cold, the  hydrogen fuel cell drive system displays the same everyday usability  as a conventional internal combustion engine. Full system power  quickly comes on tap. Even in these freezing conditions, the drive  system continues to offer its full operating range. And replenishing  the hydrogen tanks takes only three to four minutes, even in the  depths of winter. “The hydrogen fuel cell drive system combines the  best of both drive worlds, regardless of the time of year and outside  temperatures: it offers the locally emission-free mobility of an  electric vehicle and the unrestricted everyday usability – including  short refuelling stops – familiar from models with an internal  combustion engine,” says Jürgen Guldner, Vice President of    Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology and Vehicle Projects at the BMW Group.The drive system on board the BMW iX5 Hydrogen teams fuel cell  technology with an electric motor using fifth-generation BMW    eDrive technology. The hydrogen it uses as an energy source  is stored in two 700-bar tanks made from carbon-fibre-reinforced  plastic (CFRP). The fuel cell converts the hydrogen into electric  power, generating output of 125 kW/170 hp. Plus, the electric motor  can add the energy stored in a power battery to the mix. This battery  is charged either through energy recovery or from the fuel cell. All  of which means that system output of 275 kW/374 hp is  available when the driver decides to explore the upper reaches of the  car’s dynamic abilities. The only emission released by the fuel cell  is water vapour. And its waste heat is harnessed particularly  efficiently to warm the car’s interior.Unique drive system meets all requirements.The  drive, energy storage and control systems all pass the ultimate test  of endurance in the wintery surrounds of Lapland. Added to which,  specially prepared ice surfaces and snow-covered roads offer the  perfect conditions to test the integrated application of all the drive  and chassis systems. This also encompasses the steering, springs and  dampers, as well as the chassis control systems and the interplay of  the friction brakes and deceleration by energy recuperation. Here  again, the BMW iX5 Hydrogen is able to make its strengths count, as it  also weighs less than a comparable battery-electric model.The combination of fuel cell and peak power battery gives the BMW iX5  Hydrogen a globally unique drive system. Its  technology has the potential to add another pillar to the BMW Group’s  drive system portfolio for locally CO2-free mobility. BMW i  – as a brand focused entirely on mobility producing zero local  emissions – could in future offer vehicles with a hydrogen fuel cell  drive system alongside its battery-electric models. This would allow  it, most strikingly, to meet the mobility requirements of customers  who do not have their own access to electric charging infrastructure,  frequently travel long distances or desire a high degree of flexibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Renewed success in meeting CO2 targets: BMW Group continues to pursue its consistent path of emission reduction in 2021; CO2 fleet emissions of 115,9 g/km (WLTP) in 2021  Major reduction from previous year  Driven by further increases in efficiency for conventional drive technologies and strong demand for electrified vehicles ;Munich. The BMW Group once again significantly  overfulfilled its European CO2 emissions targets in 2021, continuing  to consistently pursue its path of emission reduction. With emissions  of around 115,9 grams per kilometre, according to WLTP, the company  outperformed the fleet target limit of approx. 126 grams per kilometre  by around ten grams in the EU27+2 (EU, Norway, Iceland), based on its  own internal calculations. CO2 fleet emissions were also further reduced compared to the  previous year: Converted to the WLTP cycle, the reduction was around  14 percent. The key drivers for fulfilment of the fleet target were  significantly higher sales of electrified vehicles in Europe and  further increases in efficiency for conventional drive technologies. The BMW Group already released two very successful fully-electric  vehicles onto the market in 2021, the BMW iX and the BMW i4, for which  demand is exceeding the high expectations. On the European continent,  in particular, there is strong interest in electromobility: In 2021,  more than one in four vehicles in the EU27+2 was either fully electric  or a plug-in hybrid. The success of electromobility can also be seen  from two further milestones the company reached in 2021: For the first  time, a fully-electric vehicle, the MINI Cooper SE*, became the  highest-volume model variant for one of the BMW Group brands. The  company also handed over its one-millionth electrified vehicle to its  new owner in December 2021. The BMW Group aims to sell more than 200,000 fully-electric vehicles  in 2022, at least double its sales in 2021. The launch of two more  fully-electric vehicles from important model series this year, the BMW  i7 and the BMW iX1, will further increase the total number and  percentage of electrified vehicles sold. A highly flexible, integrated  production system that allows combustion-engine vehicles and electric  models to be built on one line is a key enabler for this. In 2022, the  BMW Group will produce at least one fully-electric vehicle at each of  its German plants. In 2021, the BMW Group once again tightened its own goals to  significantly reduce CO2 emissions and also committed to a pathway  that meets the 1.5-degree goal for limiting global warming. The BMW  Group plans to lower lifecycle CO2 emissions per vehicle by at least  40 percent by 2030. The company became the first German automotive  manufacturer to join the Business Ambition for 1.5° C campaign  launched by the Science-Based Targets Initiative and is committed to  the goal of complete climate neutrality throughout the entire value  chain by 2050 at the latest.  *Consumption/emissions data: MINI Cooper SE: Power consumption in kWh/100 km  combined: 16.9-14.9 NEDC, 17.6-15.2 WLTP. If you have any questions, please contact: BMW Group Corporate Communications Sebastian Kessler, Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesTelephone: +49 89 382-21616E-mail: Sebastian.KE.Kessler@bmw.de Eckhard Wannieck, Head of Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesTelephone: +49 89 382-24544E-mail: Eckhard.Wannieck@bmwgroup.com Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comE-mail: presse@bmw.de  The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Confident and inspiring: MINI celebrates the successes of strong women with the Pat Moss Edition. ;In 1962, the British brand achieved its first international rally victory, thanks to the talent and passion of a modern-day heroine of racing: Pat Moss. The new MINI Pat Moss Edition for the MINI 3-door and        MINI 5-door is a tribute to a pioneer, MINI's sporting history and true team spirit. And strong women play a key role in shaping the success of the MINI brand today as well - these are their stories. ;"Munich. On International Women's Day 2022, MINI  remembers a legendary female racing driver. Pat Moss made motorsport  history in 1962, scoring the first international rally victory for the  British brand on the prestigious Noordwijk - Monte Carlo - Noordwijk  route, better known as the ""International Tulip Rally"". Her  victory not only kicked off the Classic MINI's unique success story in  rallying, but also caused a sensation in male-dominated racing.  ""Mossie"" and ""Wizz"", as Pat Moss and her co-pilot  Ann Wisdom were called in the racing scene, managed to create facts  that nobody could ignore. At a time when gender roles were  predetermined, these two women unceremoniously defined them  themselves. 60 years later, society has taken some decisive steps  forward. And more than ever, strong women at MINI are shaping the  success and image of the British premium brand.Stefanie Wurst has been in charge of the MINI brand since February  2022. With her experience in holistic business management and her  intercultural background, she is determined to electrify the British  premium brand and strengthen the issue of sustainability. ""It is  the very idea of MINI to make economical use of resources and  available space. The small ecological footprint is already in MINI's  genes, so to speak. When it comes to sustainability, our customers  need to know what we are doing and why, so that they can make a  conscious decision,"" says Stefanie Wurst about her approach. For  her, sustainable corporate governance also includes values such as  diversity, tolerance and openness. ""It's not about favouring  certain groups, it's about building a modern team that reflects and  understands the changing global communities well. A modern brand must  be meaningful, positive and constantly evolving.""  Jennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod is accompanying this realignment as Head  of Communications for MINI and BMW Motorrad. For her, diversity and  equal opportunities are part of MINI's recipe for success: ""We  clearly see diversity as a strength - both within and outside our  organisation - the appropriate makeup of our teams in all areas is a  key factor in the creativity, innovation and ultimately success of the  MINI brand.""With her talent, courage and passion, Pat Moss in the Classic MINI  left the male competition behind her - and many an established role  model along as well. Now a special edition bears the name of the rally  driver who died in 2008. The Pat Moss Edition for the MINI Cooper S  3-door (combined fuel consumption: 6.6 – 6.2 l/100 km";" combined CO2 emissions: 154 -  141 g/km according to WLTP) will arrive at dealers in May 2022 -  exactly 60 years after its triumph in the Netherlands. Its design reflects both the brand's racing tradition and the  personal history of Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom, and also integrates MINI  product innovations such as the Multitone Roof. """"When there is  already a strong story, as with the Pat Moss Edition, it is a pleasure  to define the details, combine the elements that underline this story,  choose the right colour combination and decide where to place the  design features,"""" says Morgane Bavagnoli, the MINI designer responsible.  Her own story at MINI began in 2010 with an internship in Munich,  which she was thrilled with right from the start and which was to  shape her career. Almost 10 years later and after working at  Designworks and BMW, Morgane Bavagnoli returned to the MINI design  team. Among other things, she was responsible for the colour concept  of the MINI Electric Pacesetter. Most recently, for example, she also  developed the design of the décor and interior surfaces for the MINI  Countryman in the """"Untamed Edition"""". Her heart beats for  surprising details that even MINI fans may only notice at second  glance. For example, the main symbol of the MINI Pat Moss Edition -  the graphic of a tulip, which can be seen discreetly but unmistakably  in many places. It is these special details with which designers like  Morgane emphasise the individual character of a MINI and contribute to  the success of the brand. """"Being a designer at MINI is something  special. The opportunity to get involved in completely different  projects and work at different levels - from pre-development and  research to concept cars and series implementation - is always  refreshing,"""" says Morgane Bavagnoli about her personal drive.Telling stories like Pat Moss's is also Lina Fischer's passion. In  the MINI Editorial Office, she works on editorial marketing and the  MINI Insider magazine. She has been part of MINI since 2010. The  editorial production around the Pat Moss Edition focused on female  empowerment in several respects. A female photographer, an editor and  two female drivers for the action scenes on the road worked together  for the shoot and staged the edition, which was largely designed by  women. """"I am proud to have worked on this project together in a  team with such strong and inspiring women,"""" says Lina Fischer.Verena Markart, Product Manager at MINI, also appreciates this kind  of inspiration in her work. For her, the MINI community in particular  is always a key driver in her work.  """"Unconventional, versatile,  creative and self-determined personalities, for whom community and new  experiences are important, motivate me every day"""" For her, the  rally victory commemorated by the Pat Moss Edition is linked to the  attitude that still applies to MINI today: “Born to compete”. The  motto rounds off the Quick Facts about the legendary Tulip Rally,  which are listed below the side scuttles on the front side walls: from  the route Noordwijk - Monte Carlo - Noordwijk, to the distance of  2,500 kilometres and the vehicle, the Mini Cooper, to its starting  number 104.""""MINI stands for thinking things differently, and that's what I  love about our brand,"""" says Yvonne Schrader, who heads up brand  management, communications management and artwork at MINI. """"I  associate Pat Moss' success above all with the motto """"Only MINI  can do"""", turning dreams into action. Mossie"""" and  """"Wizz"""" already had this mindset. They dared to do the  extraordinary instead of just talking about it.""""With British understatement, co-driver Ann Wisdom later recalled the  success in the Classic MINI: """"We didn't see ourselves as pioneers  back then, we simply drove a rally."""" The MINI team firmly  believes that diversity is a strength. A team of players with  different backgrounds and personalities is crucial - friction is where  new ideas, solutions, products and services for the MINI brand are  continuously created. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Spokesperson Product Communications  MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This includes a flap-controlled M sports  exhaust system, BMW laser light headlights, the BMW Head-Up Display  with M-specific display elements and a full Merino/Alcantara leather interior.With the debut of its latest high-performance models for the luxury  segment, BMW M GmbH makes a particularly impressive start to its  anniversary year. The BMW Group subsidiary, founded in 1972 as BMW  Motorsport GmbH, also contributed to the programme of the Amelia  Island Concours d’Elegance 2022 with a fascinating look back into its  history. A special exhibition showcased 50 milestones from BMW M  GmbH’s 50-year model and racing history. This also included an early  precursor of the current BMW M8. The prototype of a high-performance  sports car with a V12 engine developed by BMW M GmbH in the early  1990s based on the then BMW 8 Series Coupé remained a one-off – and  this was only the second time it has been put on show in the USA.The selection of vehicles that were particularly influential in the  development of BMW M GmbH also included a freshly restored example of  the BMW M1 dating from 1980, which was the company’s first  independently developed model, the BMW V12 LMR that won the 24 Hours  of Le Mans in 1999, and the all-electric BMW iX M60 that is about to  be launched on the market (combined power consumption: 24.5 – 21.9  kWh/100 km according to WLTP;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The Pat Moss Edition for the MINI 3-door and the MINI 5-door: homage to a pioneering woman. ;60 years ago, a female British racing driver gave the brand its first victory in an international rally. With charismatic edition models, MINI commemorates the start of the British small car’s extraordinary racing career and a courageous foray into a male domain. Premiere on International Women’s Day, market launch in May 2022. ;Munich. Racing is in the MINI genes: the greatest  feats in the brand’s history were achieved on the rally track. And the  foundation for all this was laid by an exceptional female driver. In  May 1962, the classic Mini was added to the list of winners of an  international rally event for the first time. In the international  Tulip Rally – from the Dutch municipality of Noordwijk to the French  Riviera and back again – Pat Moss achieved the best time over the  distance in the classic Mini Cooper. 60 years later, MINI celebrates  the talent, courage and passion of this British woman racing driver  with a fascinating special edition. The Pat Moss Edition of the MINI  3-door and MINI 5-door, limited to just over 800 vehicles, not only  commemorates the launch of the classic Mini’s extraordinary sporting  career, it also marks a pioneering achievement for female power in  motorsports. Success in the Netherlands turned the classic Mini, Pat  Moss and her co-driver Ann Wisdom into enduring heroines in a  discipline otherwise dominated by significantly larger vehicles and  entirely the preserve of men.Unconventional design features and stylish details characterise the  Pat Moss Edition, which will be available from May 2022 for the MINI  Cooper S 3-door (combined consumption: 6.6 – 6.2 l/100 km;"  combined CO2 emissions: 162 – 156 g/km according to WLTP).  With 4-cylinder turbo engines offering an output of 131 kW/178 hp or  170 kW/231 hp (MINI John Cooper Works), these cars bring the thrills  of sporty driving fun to everyday traffic. The exclusive design of the  edition models cites the racing history of the British premium brand  as well as the sporting careers of Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom.It also incorporates MINI product innovations such as the Multitone  Roof. What is more, an additional variant of the Multitone Roof is  available for the first time in the Pat Moss Edition. The colour  gradient of the vehicle roof extends from Chilli Red to Melting Silver  and Jet Black. With the innovative paint finishing process fully  integrated in production at the MINI plant in Oxford, this will be the  first time a second colour variant has been realised. It will be  available for customers to order from March 2022. Minimal deviations  in the colour pattern caused by changing environmental conditions  ensure that every MINI with a Multitone Roof has the character of a  unique specimen ex works. On the new edition models, the charismatic  roof paintwork is combined with the body finishes Pepper White or  Midnight Black metallic and also red exterior mirror caps.A stylised tulip symbolises the first rally victory: it appears on  the C pillars and side scuttles of the edition vehicles along with the  inscription “Pat Moss”. The wheel hub covers also feature an exclusive  design with a graphic which is based on the outline of the typical  Dutch flower and the MINI wordmark.The key facts of the 1962 Tulip Rally appear below the side scuttles  on the front side panels: the route Noordwijk – Monte Carlo –  Noordwijk, the distance of 2 500 kilometres, the vehicle, namely a  Mini Cooper, and its starting number 104. These are supplemented with  the slogan that still applies to MINI to this day: “born to compete”.  The tulip motif, the name inscription and the key facts about the  first every rally win are also to be found on the screen-printed  aluminium door sill trims designed exclusively for the edition model.Another design element used for the first time in the Pat Moss  Edition is the horizontally aligned bonnet stripe in white. The  printed combination of three-dimensional numbers and letters – 737 ABL  – is the registration number of the classic Mini that won the 1962  Tulip Rally, likewise recalling the historical model. Meanwhile the  original signature that Pat Moss wrote on the bonnet of her car after  one of her victories adorns the front apron of the edition model as a  graphic imprint.In the interior of the edition vehicles, the iconic signature on the  Piano Black interior surface in the passenger area is another tribute  to the revolutionary woman rally driver, who passed away in 2008. The  sports leather steering wheel bears the edition emblem in the form of  a tulip graphic which appears on the clip of the lower spoke. The  abstract depiction of engine pistons moving up and down serves as the  motif for a graphic on the interior surface on the driver’s side. With  bars of different heights forming the shape of the letters “M” and “W”  – standing for “Moss” and “Wisdom” – they symbolise that perfectly  coordinated duo that caused a sensation in the rally scene for so many years.The MINI Pat Moss Edition is a tribute to a female racing pioneer,  MINI’s rally history and true team spirit. One of the remarkable  details of the first rally triumph for the classic Mini is the fact  that Ann Wisdom insisted on taking part in the Tulip Rally despite  being pregnant at the time: she went on to provide her team mate Pat  Moss with unerring navigation guidance over the 2 500 kilometre route.Mossie and Wizz – as they were known in the paddock – formed a  successful duo for seven years. The two women had the courage to  compete in a male-dominated sport – and they brought about fundamental  changes, too. The younger sister of Formula 1 driver Stirling Moss,  Pat Moss also won the Sestriere Rally in Italy in 1968, achieved a  podium finish in numerous other international competitions and was  crowned European Ladies’ Rally Champion five times. Ann Wisdom is  considered the first professional woman co-driver in the history of  rallying. As successful sportswomen in their own right, the two viewed  their courageous foray into a male-dominated domain with typical  British understatement. “We didn’t see ourselves as pioneers back  then,” said Ann Wisdom years later. “We were just entering a rally.”Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom paved the way for an extraordinary career for  the classic Mini. In 1964, 1965 and 1967, the British small car  secured outright victory in the Monte Carlo Rally. Decades later, MINI  became the dominant brand in the world’s toughest endurance rally,  achieving overall victory in the Dakar Rally four times in a row from  2012 to 2015. Two more overall victories followed in 2020 and 2021. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Spokesperson Product Communications  MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Group Investing More Than $200 Million to Add New Press Shop at South Carolina Plant; Press Shop Will Add More Than 200 Jobs Three-Year Construction Project Will Start Production in 2024 ; Press Shop Will Add More Than 200 Jobs Three-Year Construction  Project Will Start Production in 2024   Munich/ Spartanburg, S.C.  BMW Group will invest more  than $200 million to construct a 219,000 square foot press shop at its  South Carolina plant. The investment includes more than 200 new jobs.  The announcement was made by BMW Manufacturing President and CEO  Robert Engelhorn at the South Carolina Automotive Summit in  Greenville, SC. The new press shop, which will start production in the summer of  2024, will take raw coils of steel, cut them into blanks, and stamp  sheet metal parts for BMW X models. Those components include hang-on  parts such as the vehicle’s four doors, fenders, exterior body sides,  and lift gate. “The BMW Group is known worldwide for the outstanding quality  produced by its press shops. We are excited to add this new technology  to Plant Spartanburg,” said Engelhorn. “This investment reinforces BMW  Group’s commitment in the United States and South Carolina. We  continue to play a major role in the region’s economic strength as  well as workforce development and job training.”  Highly-Skilled Manufacturing JobsA state-of-the-art press shop requires manufacturing jobs with  advanced-level training. These jobs include tool and die technicians,  electrical and mechanical maintenance for automated machinery, and  specialized line operators. More than 45 Plant Spartanburg associates  are currently training at BMW Group press shops in Leipzig, Germany,  and Swindon, UK. These associates also train with partners from the  Schuler Group, that manufactures automated servo press lines for all  BMW Group plants. While Schuler will manufacture the automated press line, all tooling  for Plant Spartanburg’s press shop will come from BMW tool shops in  Eisenach, Munich, and Dingolfing.  Since 1992, the BMW Group has invested nearly $12 billion in its  South Carolina factory. BMW Manufacturing is the largest BMW Group  plant in the world, producing more than 1,500 vehicles each day and  433,810 vehicles in 2021, a record. The factory has an annual  production capacity of up to 450,000 vehicles and employs more than  11,000 people. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Group’s innovative Edge Ecosystem wins award.; Cloud-based software suite for worldwide edge device management  Central app catalogue rolled out in the BMW Group production network  Zero-touch installation for fully automated setup  ; Cloud-based software suite for worldwide edge device management   Central app catalogue rolled out in the BMW Group production  network  Zero-touch installation for fully automated setup  Munich. The BMW Group’s Edge Ecosystem has won the  Microsoft Intelligent Manufacturing Award 2021 in the Envision  category. The cloud-based software suite allows production-related  applications (apps) on edge devices to be distribut-ed, configured and  administered worldwide. This means software innovations can now be  rolled out efficiently by users themselves without deviating from  standard-ised business processes.The Edge Ecosystem significantly reduces the effort involved in the  manual man-agement of many thousands of devices around the world. It  also helps prevent faulty configurations from causing production  shutdowns and saves on maintenance costs.  These advantages make the  innovative Edge Ecosystem a key driver in the digitalisation of the  entire BMW Group production system.Because it is open and uses standard IT technologies, the Edge  Ecosystem also allows external partners and suppliers to integrate  their hard- and software compo-nents around the world into the BMW  Group’s production system – efficiently and without special  adjustments. Fast hardware integration is enabled by a zero-touch  installer that integrates new edge devices into the ecosystem fully  automatically and without user input. Increasing efficiency and cutting downtimes in production. App configuration is managed centrally by the cloud platform and  allows hot-swapping – which is particularly important for production.  So if an edge device fails, it takes just a matter of minutes to load  the complete application and configuration onto a new device. This  reduces downtimes in production to a minimum and elimi-nates the need  for separate, complex backup management. Worldwide distribution of AI models.The BMW Group’s Edge Ecosystem is already in use in several  applications world-wide. In production, it connects the cameras and  edge devices of specialised deep learning models used for inline  quality assurance. It also allows image data, which undergoes  application-specific processing locally, to be managed and offers the  necessary flexibility for the agile exchange of AI models.The Edge Ecosystem is being used in the press shop as well. Here,  sheet metal must be oiled before being formed, but the amount of  lubrication required depends on a range of factors, such as storage  time. To ensure the optimum amount of lu-brication, a deep-learning  model was developed that transmits the lubrication pa-rameters for  each sheet to the machine and controls the system in real time. The  model has been distributed and is constantly updated in the BMW Group  Edge Ecosystem as an application for BMW Group presses around the  world so that only as much oil is used as necessary. Retrofitting to existing systems.The Edge Ecosystem can also be used to update existing systems so  that they too can work with modern applications in the cloud. This is  done by installing a special gateway software on an edge device in the  system which then converts its data into cloud-compatible formats. For  example, the technology is being used to integrate loading machines  and fire doors into the network of autonomous transport systems in logistics. Edge Ecosystem wins award.The value-adding impact the BMW Group Edge Ecosystem will have on  future production has now been confirmed by an independent source. The  system has now scooped the Microsoft Intelligent Manufacturing Award  2021 pre-sented by Microsoft and Roland Berger, in the Envision category.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Group joins responsiblelithium mining project in Chile; “Responsible Lithium Partnership” advocates for responsible management of natural resources in the Salar de Atacama salt flat  Another element of BMW Group’s activities to make lithium more sustainable  Cross-sector project with BASF, Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Daimler Truck AG, Fairphone and the Volkswagen Group  BMW Group brings scientific study on impact of lithium mining on water resources and surrounding ecosystems to project ;Munich. Responsible management of natural resources  is one of the core elements of the BMW Group’s commitment to  sustainability. Within the framework of these activities, the company  has joined the cross-sector “Responsible Lithium Partnership” project.  The aim of the project is to reach a shared understanding of  responsible management of natural resources with local interest groups  and develop a vision for the future of the Salar de Atacama salt flat  in Chile.The “Responsible Lithium Partnership” was initiated in spring 2021 by  BASF, the Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Daimler Truck AG, Fairphone and the  Volkswagen Group for a planned duration of three years. The project  does not promote lithium sourcing or the purchase or sale of mineral  raw materials. BMW Group becomes new member, shares scientific studyThe BMW Group is the sixth member to join the initiative. One of the  ways in which it is supporting the project is by sharing scientific  findings on the impact of lithium mining on water resources in Chile’s  Salar de Atacama. Together with BASF, the BMW Group had already  commissioned a study by the University of Alaska Anchorage and the  University of Massachusetts Amherst into the effects of lithium mining  on local water balances in Latin America in late 2020.The aim of the study is to gain a better scientific understanding of  the interdependencies between freshwater and lithium brine layers,  evaluate various technologies and acquire the expertise to assess  responsible lithium mining. The study provides a scientific basis for  future decisions about lithium sourcing. “Responsible Lithium Partnership” brings relevant players to    the tableThe German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) is coordinating  the project, aimed at developing a joint vision for the future of the  water catchment areas of the Salar de Atacama. Representatives from  lithium and copper mining, agriculture, tourism, indigenous  communities and government are invited to a local multi-stakeholder  platform where they will develop measures together. A further aim is  to develop a joint action plan to improve long-term management of  natural resources and implement initial steps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
“WE ARE M” – BMW M celebrates its 50th anniversary with emotional campaign.; Kick-off on 24 February with film about BMW M Huddle Year-long campaign in four chapters  Anniversary year heralds transformation of the brand: New performance, electrification and expressive luxury will characterise BMW M in the future  ;Munich. When the 50th anniversary of the founding of  BMW M GmbH takes place on 24 May, the celebrations will already be in  full swing. Celebrations for the anniversary kick off on 24 February  with a unique event: in a film, various BMW M vehicles along with  their drivers get together for a huddle. This kind of huddle for  coordinating strategies, motivating and cheering each other on is  known from almost every team sport. It is impressively staged with  many BMW M models.The film about this most sporting of gatherings shows in a very  emotional way what the international BMW M community is all about.  However different the vehicles and their people might be – they all  love the accelerated heartbeat and the goose bumps that every BMW M  triggers. Excited and enthusiastic as they are, they go their own way,  are courageous and take a stance. What unites them is the passion for  that special feeling every driver of a BMW M experiences. They all  feel: WE ARE M.“We are proud of the roaring start to our anniversary year on 24  February. The film “Huddle Speech” is in the tradition of  extraordinary films for BMW M, but is nevertheless different: it  heralds our transformation. We are looking ahead, but continuing to  create a feeling of home that defines the great BMW M fanbase,” says  Timo Resch, Head of Customer, Brand, Sales at BMW M GmbH. “We want to  celebrate with all the fans, with our international community,  therefore we have surprises in store for all communication channels,  all year round. We are really looking forward to it.”WE ARE M stands for everything that was and will continue to be.The claim created especially for the anniversary year shows the  sentiment of the campaign: BMW M is exceedingly multifaceted, always  appearing different and new, but instantly recognisable. From the M1  Procar and the i4 M50 to the XM Concept: BMW M is defined by a true  firework of vehicles. What unites them, despite all their differences,  is this main characteristic: being BMW M, thus always different,  unique and edgy – which is exactly what the campaign picks up on.The 50 Years campaign is divided into four chapters, each of which is  activated over a period of one quarter. Whilst the first chapter, the  “Huddle Speech”, heralds the basic theme of 50 years of BMW M, the  second will be predominantly about BMW M's 50-year motorsport history.  The third chapter deals with electrification, while the fourth focuses  on the unique lifestyle. During the course of the year, BMW M GmbH  will present a host of spectacular new vehicles. In addition, the  brand will present itself at numerous major international events. The  recently unveiled “BMW Motorsport Anniversary Emblem” is just one of  many more surprises for the global BMW M community.With its heritage, BMW M is setting its sights on the future.The holistic communication on the occasion of the 50th anniversary  also takes a look back at the unparalleled history of BMW M GmbH  experiences, achievements and successes in the performance and  high-performance segment. One example of this is the digital campaign  “Only in M Town” from the year 2018, which, even at that time, gave  BMW M enthusiasts the feeling to be at home.But BMW M does not rest on its laurels. It utilises this strength for  its future transformation. As the next three chapters of the campaign  already imply, BMW M is oriented towards new performance,  electrification and the typical BMW M lifestyle. Because BMW M is and  will remain the Ultimate Driving Machine. After half a century and in  the future. Link to the campaign film:https://youtu.be/Jt_JL29K6Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

With the Julia Hülsmann Trio  on March 8 and the Jacob Karlzon  Trio on March 22, the BMW Welt Jazz Award  2022 kicks off its thirteenth season. A total of six free concerts  given on Tuesday evenings from March to April 2022 will see  international jazz ensembles interpret this year’s theme “Key  Position” in the Double Cone of BMW Welt. Following the  concerts, an expert jury will nominate two finalists to compete for  the award on July 9, 2022. In addition, the viewers can help their  favorite ensemble to win the audience award.On March 8, the German ensemble Julia    Hülsmann Trio will kick off this year’s BMW Welt Jazz  Award. Berlin-based pianist Hülsmann is one of the selected German  musicians “who give fresh impetus to the world of European jazz”, said  the jury of SWR Jazz Award as early as 2016. Hülsmann first made her  mark with lyrical interpretations for the label ACT in collaboration  with prominent vocalists such as Rebekka Bakken, Anna Lauvergnac and  Roger Cicero. Since moving to ECM in 2008, she has to date released  seven albums, all featuring her inimitable, delicate and completely  pared-down performances on the piano interpreting her own  compositions. At the heart of each project is her trio with bassist  Marc Muellbauer and drummer Heinrich Köbberling, which has performed  in this constellation for 20 years. This year, the current awardee of  the German Jazz Prize and her trio will be on stage at the BMW Welt  Jazz Award.For the second concert on March 22, BMW Welt will be  host to the Jacob Karlzon Trio. Swedish musician  Jacob Karlzon counts among the outstanding jazz pianists coming out of  Scandinavia in recent years. Following a long period as accompanist of  vocalist Viktoria Tolstoy, Karlzon made his name on the international  stage with numerous projects of his own. Combining his passion for  improvisation with unexpected rock rhythms and an open style  characteristic to Scandinavian jazz, he prefers the term “alternative  artist” to jazz pianist. True to his own style, Karlzon’s albums to  date show influences from Ravel to hard bop, from metal to EDM, merged  effortlessly by his preference for minimalist melodies. He is  currently in Munich, promoting his new album “Wanderlust”, released by  Warner and featuring the trio’s other members, bassist Morten Ramsbøl  and drummer Rasmus Kihlberg.Evening concerts of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2022March 8, 2022         Julia Hülsmann TrioMarch 22, 2022       Jacob Karlzon TrioApril 5, 2022            Anat Fort TrioApril 12, 2022         Giovanni Guidi QuintetApril 19, 2022         Marco Mezquida Trio April 26, 2022         Ashley Henry QuartetThe concerts in the Double Cone of BMW Welt are offered free of  charge;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Joint winners in the BMW Munich – Urban Production architecture competition ; Rotterdam’s OMA and Copenhagen’s 3XN architects chosen as winners  Successful approaches to outstanding, sustainable production in the urban environment of Munich ;Munich. The winners of the BMW Munich – Urban  Production architecture competition for outstanding, future-proof  production at the home plant in Munich have been decided. The jury of  the international contest voted unanimously in favour of designs by  Rotterdam’s OMA and Copenhagen’s 3XN architects. After a day and a  half of intense deliberation, they concluded that the winning  solutions of both practices were of the same high standard. Both had  interpreted the task very well and convinced the jury with their  different focal points. All six of the participating projects from  international architecture practices were of excellent quality and had  offered various solutions for successfully integrating innovative,  sustainable, competitive production into an urban environment. “The two first prizes have gone to projects with quite different  winning characteristics. Both harbour major potential for a masterplan  that meets the needs of the special, inner-city environment of BMW  Plant Munich and will ready it for the future,” said Dieter Reiter,  Lord Mayor of Munich. “Our industry is in the middle of the transformation to  electromobility, digitalisation and circularity, a transformation made  possible by our employees. Creating the perfect environment for them  to perform, identify with our company and experience valuable  encounters is fundamental to our success – today and in the future.   But we are also a part of the social system around us and take  responsibility for the development of our urban environment. Together  with our stakeholders, we are developing a masterplan that will offer  a long-term perspective to people inside and outside the plant. Our  aim is to create a progressive environment for work and production  that focuses firmly on sustainability, urban planning, transport and  logistics, as well as the local neighbourhood,” said Ilka Horstmeier,  BMW AG Board Member for HR and Labour Relations Director. “To mark its centenary, we are shaping the future of our home plant  with a top-class architecture competition – a strong commitment by the  BMW Group to this unique plant in the middle of Munich,” said Milan  Nedeljković, BMW AG Board Member for Production. “The winning designs  by OMA and 3XN are convincing, forward-looking proposals that coincide  with our own vision for an innovative and integrative working world.  As the transformation to electromobility continues, production at BMW  is becoming more efficient, flexible, digital and sustainable than ever.” The aim of the BMW Munich – Urban Production planning competition was  to find a design that is both functional and convincing in terms of  urban development. The focus should be on efficient, competitive  production on the one hand and embedding the plant into its urban  environment on the other. The BMW Group will now join forces with the  award-winners to further their proposals develop, so that the company  can benefit as fully as possible from the various opportunities of the  different approaches and their synergies, and to develop a coherent,  forward-looking masterplan. Members of the juryThe members of the award jury were: Dieter Reiter, Lord Mayor of  Munich; Michael Hardi, Head of Planning of the City of Munich; various  renowned architects, landscape architects, transport planners, and  further representatives of the Munich City Council. OMA OFFICE FOR METROPOLITAN ARCHITECTURE OMA is an international practice operating in the field of  architecture and urbanism. AMO, a research and design studio, applies  architectural thinking to domains beyond architecture.Rem Koolhaas founded OMA in 1975 together with Elia and Zoe Zenghelis  and Madelon Vriesendorp. He is also a professor at Harvard University  and at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing.Today, OMA is led by eight partners – Rem Koolhaas, Reinier de Graaf,  Ellen van Loon, Shohei Shigematsu, Iyad Alsaka, Chris van Duijn, Jason  Long, and Managing Partner-Architect David Gianotten – and maintains  offices in Rotterdam, New York, Hong Kong, Doha, and Australia.OMA-designed buildings currently under construction are the  renovation of Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe) in Berlin, The Factory in  Manchester, Hangzhou Prism, the CMG Times Center in Shenzhen and the  Simone Veil Bridge in Bordeaux.OMA was supported by Vogt Landschaftsarchitekten GmbH, Berlin,  Systematica S.r.l., Mailand, Transsolar Energietechnik GmbH, Munich,  Ingenieursgesellschaft Prof. Dr. Sieker mbH, Hoppegarten,  knippershelbig GmbH, Berlin and Büro Stanek, Berlin.3XN3XN was founded in 1986 and has more than 30  years of experience in creating cultural, office and residential  environments, which positively affect behaviour, productivity and  social interaction. In 2007, 3XN extended with a research and  innovation department “GXN Innovation”, who’s research and prime  services in Behavioural-, Circular-, and Parametric design channels  directly into 3XN’s designs and strategies to meet the challenges of  the 21st century. The synergy between 3XN and GXN - between Practice  and Research - not only allows us to design some of the most  sustainable buildings in the world. We design buildings that place  users at the heart of our designs, with the intention to foster  well-being and social dynamics across age, culture and background. 3XN we believes that “architecture shapes behaviour”. This philosophy  is a fundamental pillar in 3XN design approach, as 3XN believes that  Architecture can positively shape people’s behaviour for learning. 3XN  approach is that new buildings should add new and positive qualities  to their environment, the wider area and the brief in order to unlock  potentials for social interaction and interdisciplinary work. Driven  from a Scandinavian approach, 3XN has grown to employ more 180  architects and researchers from 25 different nationalities, who have  local and international experience. 3XN holds offices in Copenhagen  (HQ), Sydney, New York, London and Stockholm, of which their global  capacity gives them the ability to design buildings from a global best  practice, while respecting local cultures and new perspectives.3XN was supported by Latz + Partner LandschaftsArchitekten  Stadtplaner, Kranzberg,  WSP Germany, Munich, GXN, Kopenhagen and  Harald Niemöller Prüfgesellschaft, Munich. If you have any questions, please contact: Corporate CommunicationsHanns Huber, Communications Production Network BMW GroupMobile:   +49-151-601-31181Mail: hanns.ha.huber@bmw.deInternet: www.press.bmwgroup.com/deutschlandE-mail: presse@bmwgroup.com Die BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

The season kicks off with the opening weekend from 29th April to 1st May at Portimão, Portugal.;Munich. Walkenhorst Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport are the    two BMW M Motorsport teams which will compete with the new BMW M4    GT3 in the 2022 DTM season. They will run a total of four cars, with    the three BMW M Motorsport works drivers Marco Wittmann (GER),    Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Philipp Eng (AUT) among those at the    wheel. The season kicks off with the opening weekend from 29th April    to 1st May at Portimão, Portugal. Walkenhorst Motorsport will contest its second season in  the DTM in 2022. The team from Melle (GER) started last year with a  BMW M6 GT3, claiming two victories and a total of five podiums with  two-time DTM champion Wittmann. Walkenhorst Motorsport now competes  with two new BMW M4 GT3s, with Wittmann again behind the wheel. The  second car will be driven by Walkenhorst driver Esteban Muth (BEL). Schubert Motorsport has also been running BMW M  Motorsport race cars in various international championships for many  years. The Oschersleben (GER) team is now set for its DTM debut with  two BMW M4 GT3s. In van der Linde and Eng, Schubert Motorsport also  has two drivers with a wealth of DTM and GT3 experience in the cockpit. Quotes. Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH: “The DTM is  an important platform, which sets benchmarks – not only in terms of  the actual racing, but with its overall presence. The DTM provides a  perfect stage for our new BMW M4 GT3 and our BMW M Motorsport teams,  Walkenhorst Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport. With these two strong  and renowned teams, along with our three works drivers Marco Wittmann,  Sheldon van der Linde and Philipp Eng, the BMW M Motorsport family is  superbly positioned ahead of the 2022 DTM season. We are looking  forward to top-class, captivating racing at some fantastic  international racetracks. At the same time, the DTM platform also  plays a key role in our other activities. In the DTM Trophy, the BMW M  Motorsport teams are strongly represented with the BMW M4 GT4. In the  BMW M2 Cup, we are taking our own one-make cup onto the track within  the framework of the DTM, and in the DTM Classic, we will witness  fascinating vehicles from BMW M history. We are celebrating the  50th birthday of BMW M GmbH this year, and our history is  closely linked to the DTM so we are planning to mark our 50th  anniversary with various special events and activities within the DTM  environment. We are already really looking forward to the start of a  great 2022 season.” Andreas Roos, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “Last year,  we witnessed thrilling GT3 racing of the highest standard in the DTM,  and we are now excited to see four new BMW M4 GT3s in action in this  series in the hands of two very experienced BMW M Motorsport teams.  Walkenhorst Motorsport is expanding its involvement in the DTM from  one to two cars in the coming season. In doing so, they have set a  course to back up the success they have enjoyed so far, together with  BMW M Motorsport works driver Marco Wittmann and newcomer Esteban  Muth. Schubert Motorsport is also a well-known team on the  international racing scene, and it is fantastic to see the team expand  its activities to include the DTM. In Sheldon van der Linde and  Philipp Eng, we are providing two BMW M Motorsport works drivers who,  like Wittmann, are very familiar with the DTM, its environment and the  procedures. We are looking forward to an exciting 2022 DTM season with  Walkenhorst Motorsport, Schubert Motorsport and the new BMW M4 GT3!” Henry Walkenhorst, Team Principal Walkenhorst  Motorsport: “We are delighted to be able to confirm our  involvement in the DTM and the DTM Trophy alongside BMW for the coming  years. After the positive impact we made in 2021, with two race wins  and several podium finishes, we are confident that we can back up that  success with our new spearhead, the BMW M4 GT3. We are proud to line  up with two cars this year. With Mega-Marco and Overtaker-Esteban, we  have found the perfect combination for our team. The faith being put  in us by BMW and our sponsors motivates the whole team to do  everything in its power to achieve the big goal. We are looking  forward to the 2022 DTM, hopefully with plenty of fans at the circuit.” Torsten Schubert, Team Principal Schubert  Motorsport: “Entering the DTM is another milestone for  Schubert Motorsport, and one which I, and the whole team, are very  proud. It is one of the most attractive racing series in the world,  and its name has always been synonymous with professional racing of  the highest standard. The attributes required match our personal  approach, with which we have been competing at the racetracks of this  world for more than two decades. Since I first watched the DTM in  Wunstorf almost 30 years ago, I have been following the series more  intensely all the time. The series reinvented itself last year and set  course for an exciting future. The collaboration with the teams is  very close and we would obviously have liked to have been there from  the outset. We are pleased to now be part of DTM and to take this path  together with our long-term partner BMW M Motorsport.” Marco Wittmann, #11 BMW M4 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport: “It is great to be a part of Walkenhorst  Motorsport again, and to compete in the DTM. As I have always raced in  the DTM since 2013, I am very much looking forward to the challenge.  Last year, we found our feet well as a new team, and in the new GT3  format. We enjoyed some real highs, claimed two victories with the BMW  M6 GT3, and were in contention for the title until shortly before the  end of the season. In the end, we finished fourth overall. We are now  looking to build on that success in 2022, especially in the knowledge  that we race with the new BMW M4 GT3 this year. I am looking forward  to appearing with the guys and girls at Walkenhorst Motorsport again,  and doing battle for victories and podiums. Perhaps we can have a big  say at the very top of the championship. I can hardly wait for the  tests and the first race at Portimão.” Esteban Muth, #10 BMW M4 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport: “I am extremely happy to join Walkenhorst  Motorsport this year. It will be great with them;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Art on four wheels as small series from Dingolfing.;Exclusive THE 8 X JEFF KOONS limited-edition BMW model to be built at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing from March  Expressive design applied in unique combination of large-scale production processes and meticulous craftsmanship at Dingolfing paint shop ;Exclusive THE 8 X JEFF KOONS limited-edition BMW model to be    built at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing from March  Expressive design    applied in unique combination of large-scale production processes    and meticulous craftsmanship at Dingolfing paint shop  Dingolfing. On 17 February, the strictly  limited-edition model THE 8 X JEFF KOONS, based on the BMW M850i  xDrive Gran Coupé (fuel consumption combined: 11.0-10.7 l/100 km WLTP,  CO2 emissions combined: 251-243 g/km WLTP) celebrated its  world premiere on the occasion of the Frieze art fair in Los Angeles.  Production of the 99 models will get underway at BMW Group Plant  Dingolfing in March – relying on a unique combination of established  large-scale standard production processes and craftsmanship at the  Lower Bavarian plant’s paint shop.This exclusive special model is the most elaborately designed vehicle  in BMW history. Over a period of many months, American artist Jeff  Koons perfected sketches of the expressive exterior design of his  dream BMW and then assisted with its implementation in  three-dimensional form in the actual car.He travelled from New York to Dingolfing several times in the last  few months for workshops involving intense discussions with BMW  specialists about lines and joints, angles and perspectives, colours  or the choice and arrangement of materials for the vehicles’ interior.“We are proud to produce these ‘sculptures on wheels’ here in  Dingolfing and to share our extensive car building know-how, our  attention to detail, our precision and the craftsmanship of our  employees,” says Christoph Schröder, head of Plant Dingolfing. “It is  also a very special small series for us and an honour to work with one  of the most renowned artists of our time.”THE 8 X JEFF KOONSThe limited edition’s expressive, sporty and powerful exterior design  combines 11 different colours, from blue to silver and yellow to  black. It features pop-art elements as well as geometric patterns that  are precisely tailored to the sophisticated lines and forms of the BMW  8 Series Gran Coupé. The lines of colour that explode across the rear  of the vehicle are a direct tribute to Jeff Koons’ own 2010 BMW Art  Car. According to Koons, the “POP!” stencilled on the sides and the  swirls of wind symbolise power and speed.Over 200 hours of manual work for exterior paintwork aloneProduction of the vehicle will get underway at Plant Dingolfing in  March. The process for body construction and assembly does not differ  significantly from that of a BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé that can be  ordered as a regular product. However, other components and materials  chosen by the artist will also be installed in the limited-edition  model to customise the vehicle – from the seats in rich tones of red  and blue, to the finest leather, up to and including the artist’s  signature in the Bavarian Blue of the BMW logo on the cupholder trim.Once it reaches the paint shop, the limited-edition model goes  through an entirely custom process in which Jeff Koons’ unique design  is applied layer by layer to a vehicle with a Glacier Silver basecoat.  This does not, of course, take place in the normal series process on  the plant’s highly automated finish paint lines, but in separate spray  booths with workstations designed for skilled manual work. Here, a  team of around 20 employees applies the lettering, graphic elements  and coloured lines or surfaces by hand, layer by layer, with the help  of stencils or foils.“We use a total of eight different design colours,” explains Marco  Klante, the project manager at the Dingolfing paint shop. At certain  intervals, the vehicles are returned to the standard production  process, where the hand-applied design is “sealed” with a clear coat.  The vehicles are also finely brushed by hand on a regular basis to  ensure smooth transitions between individual painted design elements  that cannot be detected by hand. This is another highly time-consuming  process requiring the utmost precision. “Because all the paint coats  applied together are not even half a millimetre thick,” Klante explains.A hand-picked team of paint specialists was brought together for the  project, some of whom already had experience working on custom  paintwork for Rolls-Royce and the BMW 7 Series. The team, working in  three shifts around the clock, also includes former painting  apprentices who are among the best in the country. This means four of  these special models can be painted in a week. Each vehicle requires  well over 200 hours just for exterior painting of the body. Plastic  mounted parts like the elaborately painted tailgate are supplied by  the nearby BMW Group Plant Landshut.Those responsible at Plant Dingolfing are looking forward to the  official start of production. Christoph Schröder: “We are very well  prepared and have worked with Jeff Koons to optimise every detail for  overall effect. Now, we have to realise these 99 vehicles with maximum  precision and repeat accuracy as the artist intended and in the  interests of our customers.”CO2 EMISSIONS & FUEL CONSUMPTION.BMW M850i xDrive Gran CoupéFuel consumption combined: 11.0-10.7  l/100 km WLTP,CO2 emissions combined: 251-243 g/km WLTP. If you have any questions, please contact: Manuel Sattig, BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, head of CommunicationsTelephone: 49 8731 76 22020, Email: Manuel.Sattig@bmwgroup.com Thomas Niedermeier, BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, CommunicationsTelephone: +49 8731 76 27666, Email: Thomas.Niedermeier@bmwgroup.com Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.com, www.bmw-werk-dingolfing.deInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bmwgroupwerkdingolfing/Email: presse@bmw.de   BMW Group Plant Dingolfing Plant Dingolfing is  one of the BMW Group’s 31 global production sites and the company’s  largest European manufacturing facility.

THE 8 X JEFF KOONS: Painting expertise from Landshut showcased in Jeff Koons’ sculptures on wheels; Plastic exterior components for strictly limited edition of BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé crafted at BMW Group Plant Landshut – Car designed by American artist Jeff Koons  Biggest challenge for Landshut custom paint shop: “Capturing the spirit of the artist and implementing the details in a technical small-series process”; Plastic exterior components for strictly limited edition    of BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé crafted at BMW Group Plant Landshut – Car    designed by American artist Jeff Koons Biggest challenge for Landshut custom paint shop:    “Capturing the spirit of the artist and implementing the details in    a technical small-series process” München / Landshut. Painting expertise from BMW Group  Plant Landshut is currently being showcased in a strictly limited  edition of the M850i xDrive Gran Coupé (fuel consumption combined:  11.0-10.7 l/100 km WLTP, CO2 emissions combined: 251-243 g/km WLTP)  created by American artist Jeff Koons for a small production run of  just 99 vehicles – the most elaborately designed vehicle in BMW history.Around 2,000 painted plastic outer panel sections in 45 standard and  200 custom colours leave the Landshut plant every workday. This adds  up to about half a million components a year, including bumpers,  side-sills, spoilers and trim – not counting small-series and custom paintwork.The Landshut paint specialists are now putting their years of  expertise to work in a very special vehicle, a limited edition of the  BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé – THE 8 X JEFF KOONS. The car was designed by  American artist Jeff Koons and features pop-art elements, as well as  geometric patterns.The special edition vehicles will be built at BMW Group Plant  Dingolfing, while BMW Group Plant Landshut will supply all painted  plastic outer panel sections, including the bumpers, side-sills,  mirror caps, door handles and the tailgate. All components are crafted  to the highest degree of precision.“The biggest challenge was to understand and capture the spirit of  the artist right from the start and to implement his very precise  demands in detail by hand in a technical small-series process,”  explains Hermann Knott, head of Production Paint and Finish. “This is  also a very special project for us – because these cars are really  sculptures on wheels.”One of the most technically complex components for the vehicle is the  stylish tailgate, requiring seven different colours and twelve coats  of paint with a total thickness of less than 250 μ. For comparison, a  human hair has a diameter of about 100 μ. “Applying multi-coloured  paintwork is particularly challenging as far as haptics and optics are  concerned,” explains Knott. The so-called “multitone” process used for  this was specially developed at the Landshut custom paint shop. “We  had various meetings with Jeff Koons’ team, where we discussed  everything needed for the process in detail,” reports Knott.A key element was how to realise the artist’s one-dimensional design  in three-dimensional, geometric vehicle components. A computer  programme connected to a laser projector was used to ensure the  accuracy of every detail. The laser then projected the design in  linear form onto the respective component. The contours between  individual layers of paint were meticulously hand stencilled, a task  requiring years of experience and craftsmanship.Most of the roughly 100 employees involved in the project received  special additional training to be able to meet the artistic  requirements. “Crafting the Jeff Koons components is different to both  our standard finishing by robots and our established custom painting  processes. It requires considerable individual experience and flair,  because there are many influencing factors,” explains Knott.“Taking pleasure in innovation and craftsmanship are two outstanding  characteristics of our staff at the Landshut location. That is why we  are especially proud that our Exterior Plastic team is once again  setting the benchmark for custom paintwork,” says Dr Stefan  Kasperowski, head of BMW Group Plant Landshut. THE 8 X JEFF KOONSTHE 8 X JEFF KOONS is the embodiment of precision, sophistication and  craftsmanship. It took 285 hours to apply its multiple coats of paint,  for instance, since its impressively expressive design combines 11  different colours, from blue to silver and yellow to black. This means  only two car bodies can be painted per week. The multi-coloured  interior is characterised by its impressive use of high-quality  materials and the finest leather, in addition to featuring the  artist’s signature. The seats are in rich hues of red and blue, the  colours of superheroes from the comic universe and the  high-performance brand BMW M. The sporty, powerful design features  both pop-art elements and geometric patterns – a nod to the  sophisticated lines and forms of the 8 Series Gran Coupé. The lines of  colour that explode across the rear of the vehicle are a direct  tribute to the artist's own 2010 BMW Art Car. According to Koons, the  “POP!” stencilled on the sides and the swirls of wind symbolise the  power and speed of THE 8 X JEFF KOONS.

BMW Junior Team 2022: Nordschleife and GT World Challenge Europe with 24h highlights at the Nürburgring and Spa-Francorchamps.;The BMW Junior Team enters its third year in 2022, and will be in action on two fronts with the BMW M4 GT3. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) will team up with BMW M Team RMG at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), as they look to challenge for overall victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. More highlights await the trio in the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup. ;Munich. The BMW Junior Team enters its third year in 2022, and    will be in action on two fronts with the BMW M4 GT3. Dan Harper    (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) will team up with BMW    M Team RMG at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), as they look to    challenge for overall victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. More    highlights await the trio in the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance    Cup. There, the BMW Junior Team and ROWE Racing will contest five    endurance races, with the highlight being the 24 Hours of    Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). At the wheel of the second ROWE Racing BMW    M4 GT3 will be BMW M works drivers Nick Catsburg (NED), Augusto    Farfus (BRA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR).  “The term BMW Junior Team has become a legendary one, even outside of  BMW M Motorsport. I am very pleased that we have been able to add new  chapters to this legend since 2020,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of  BMW M GmbH and one of the mentors of the current BMW Junior Team. “Dan  Harper, Max Hesse and Neil Verhagen have performed impressively for  the past two years and lived up to name ‘BMW Junior Team’. I am  certain that they will cause quite a stir again this season at the  wheel of the BMW M4 GT3. I find it particularly fascinating how the  current success sees the project come full circle since the founding  of the first BMW Junior Team in 1977, thanks to Jochen Neerpasch’s  initiative. Even after so many decades, Mr Neerpasch remains a great  asset and inspiration for BMW M Motorsport.” Neerpasch says: “The BMW Junior Team has successfully completed its  apprenticeship on the Nordschleife for the past two years. The three  lads are now preparing intensively for their biggest test at the  Nürburgring 24 Hours. We have high expectations of them. As far as the  drivers themselves are concerned, I see the BMW Junior Team on the  podium. They will also be put to the test in the GT World Challenge  Europe. They will be driving at racetracks that are new to them, and  will be up against the best GT drivers in the world – at ROWE Racing,  they will be in direct comparison with established BMW M works  drivers. It is going to be an eventful season, but I am sure that they  will succeed again in the new environment.” Harper, Hesse and Verhagen are currently with Formula Medicine in  Viareggio (ITA), where they are preparing physically and mentally for  the season ahead. They are living together in one house there, as they  will do at the Nürburgring again after the GT World Challenge Europe  test at the start of March. This is to ensure they are as close as  possible to the racetrack and BMW M Team RMG ahead of the start of the  season. The first race in the BMW M4 GT3 will be the opening round of  the Nürburgring Endurance Series on 26th March – followed  by the first race in the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup at  Imola (ITA) on 3rd April. The focus will then switch fully  to the Nordschleife until the 24-hour race on  28th/29th May. The GT World Challenge season  continues at the start of June at Le Castellet (FRA). This is followed  by the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps and the final two races at  Hockenheim (GER) and Barcelona (ESP). Base camp for the BMW Junior  Team for the second half of the season will be Viareggio. The team responsible for the BMW M4 GT3 that the BMW Junior Team will  drive in the GT World Challenge Europe is ROWE Racing. Team principal  Hans-Peter Naundorf’s outfit will compete with a second BMW M4 GT3,  driven by BMW M works drivers Nick Catsburg, Augusto Farfus and Nick  Yelloly. ROWE Racing will also start with two BMW M4 GT3 and a strong  contingent of BMW M works drivers at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. The  detailed driver line-up will be announced shortly. More quotes. Hans-Peter Naundorf, team principal ROWE Racing: “We  are very happy to go into the 2022 season of the GT World Challenge  Europe with such a strong squad of drivers. It is going to be an  exciting year, with three very experienced BMW M works drivers in one  car and the three guys from the BMW Junior Team in the other. That is  a perfect mix. We are very proud that BMW M Motorsport has entrusted  us with accompanying the next step of the BMW Junior Team this year.  We followed their positive development last year. They improved  consistently and hardly made a mistake at the toughest racetrack in  the world. As such, the logical next step in their career is to move  up into an international racing series. Nick Catsburg and Nick Yelloly  have been among the guarantees of success for our team for a long  time, and have emphatically demonstrated their class many times.  Personally, I am thrilled to be working with Augusto Farfus for the  first time in our seventh year with BMW. His success and history with  BMW speak volumes and I find it particularly interesting how he still  goes about his work with so much joy and enthusiasm.” Stefan Reinhold, team principal BMW M Team RMG:  “After last year’s intensive test work, my whole team is now looking  forward to going up against the strong opposition at the Nürburgring  with the BMW M4 GT3. We know the car well and are confident that we  will quickly become competitive on the Nordschleife. Despite that, it  is obviously still a new car, so the preparatory races are extremely  important for us, in order to prepare as well as possible for the big  highlight – the 24-hour race. The expectations for our home race are  very high. The collaboration with the BMW Junior Team is working  excellently. In our second year together, we are a well-coordinated  team, and the guys have huge potential as drivers. If we can work  together to convert that into performance at the circuit, we can  compete at the very front. Victory at our home race is still missing  from the BMW M Team RMG collection.” Dan Harper: “The programme looks great! It is  fantastic to return to the Nordschleife with BMW M Team RMG, and this  time to do battle for overall victory in the 24-hour race. In the GT  World Challenge Europe, I will get to know five circuits that are  totally new to me. I am really looking forward to that. The 24 Hours  of Spa-Francorchamps will obviously be a highlight, and it is great to  be working with such an experienced and winning team there as ROWE  Racing. Lining up against three experienced BMW M works drivers in the  same team will be a very special challenge.” Max Hesse: “Our third year as the BMW Junior Team is  going to be exciting, as a new car and a new race schedule await us.  We have already gained some initial experience of the BMW M4 GT3 and  are currently in Viareggio preparing for the start of the season. We  already know BMW M Team RMG well and I am sure we will work well  together on the Nordschleife again. I am really looking forward to  working with our new partner team ROWE Racing and, of course, to the  races in a fantastic series like the GT World Challenge Europe. We  really wanted to race in this series. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport  for the faith they are putting in us!” Neil Verhagen: “We have been preparing intensively,  both physically and mentally, for weeks now, in order to be top fit  come the start of the season. We can now hardly wait to get back out  on track for the first tests. Our big goal for the Nordschleife is to  challenge for overall victory in the 24-hour race. The GT World  Challenge Europe with ROWE Racing is going to be a fantastic new  experience for us. We are learning new racetracks and will go wheel to  wheel with the best GT drivers in the world. I am sure we will learn  an awful lot there.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Manufacturing led the  nation in automotive exports by value for the eighth consecutive year,  according to data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce. During  2021, BMW Plant Spartanburg exported 257,876 BMWs with a total export  value of more than $10.1 billion. The BMWs produced in Spartanburg,  South Carolina, were exported to about 120 countries primarily through  the Port of Charleston, SC (nearly 219,000 units), through five  additional southeastern ports and by rail to Canada.The top five export countries from BMW Manufacturing were China  (24.1% of export volume), Germany (12.3%), South Korea (9.4%), Canada  (5.6%), and Great Britain (5.4%).“Free trade and open markets are essential for global businesses and  economies to grow. It is the reason BMW and South Carolina have been  successful,” said Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management  of BMW AG responsible for Production. “Plant Spartanburg contributes  greatly to the success of the BMW Group. They are the center of  competence for our X family of vehicles. They have world-class people  who build world-class products. I congratulate our 11,000 associates  for this achievement, and I thank our partners throughout South  Carolina for their outstanding support.”“Claiming the top spot for U.S. automobile exports by value rounds  out a very successful year for BMW Plant Spartanburg. I’m incredibly  proud of our associates and the resilience they have shown the past  year,” said Dr. Robert Engelhorn, president and CEO of BMW  Manufacturing. “This achievement demonstrates BMW’s trusted  partnership with this state and its continued commitment to the United States.”In 2021, BMW Manufacturing set a new production record with 433,810  BMW X vehicles produced.

From Las Vegas to Munich: The BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink at BMW Welt.;From today, the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink is on display in the new BMW i exhibition at BMW Welt.;"At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the BMW  Group presented the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink – a unique technology  that enables the exterior to change colour. From now until the  mid-March, visitors to the BMW Welt have the opportunity to view the  spectacular vehicle in the recently opened BMW i exhibition.What is the technology behind the color change and what is the    added value?The special paint finish works in a similar way to the technology in  e-book readers. A special body foiling integrates several million  colour capsules. Negatively charged white or positively charged black  pigments are stimulated by electrical signals and collect on the  surface and in this way change the exterior colour. ""In this way,  we give drivers the freedom to express different sides of their  personality to the outside world and redefine them on every  journey,"" says Stella Clarke, Project Head of BMW iX Flow  featuring E Ink. With the ability to change the exterior colour and to  display different patterns, the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink opens up  new worlds for an individual driving experience. But the technology  also offers numerous potential areas of application beyond the  customer experience, for example to improve energy efficiency. The  electrophoretic paint in the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink differs from  displays in that it does not constantly consume energy. Only when  switching over is electricity very briefly required. The matching  exterior colour actually improves the energy efficiency of the  vehicle. A white surface will reflect sunlight significantly more than  a black one, meaning the interior heats up less. Changing the colour  thus reduces energy consumption. The colour change in the all-electric  BMW iX not only boosts the mood of the passengers, but also the  vehicle's range.BMW Welt Opening Hours.Monday to Saturday from  7.30 a.m. until 00.00 midnight.

The BMW M2 CS Racing has been successful in a wide range  of championships – and, as a thoroughbred race car, is perfectly  suited to leading the field as the safety car in the pinnacle of  motorcycle racing. We are looking forward to our 24th season as  ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’ and to seeing the BMW M2 CS Racing in action  as a safety car for the first time in Qatar.” “BMW M has been our partner since 1999 and, over the course of this  long-term collaboration, has always thrilled us with new highlights,”  added Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports.  “With a safety car based on a real race car, BMW M is once again  setting new benchmarks this year.

BMW to Debut a New Advertisement during the Super Bowl Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Salma Hayek Pinault and the All-New, Fully Electric BMW iX Sports Activity Vehicle.;Conceived by Goodby Silverstein & Partners and directed by Bryan Buckley, the 60-second spot will air during the third commercial break of the first quarter. BMW to launch two All-New, fully electric vehicles in the U.S. next month – the BMW iX Sports Activity Vehicle and the four-door BMW i4 Gran Coupe. ;Woodcliff Lake, NJ. BMW will debut a new 60-second  advertisement during the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 13, 2022, to  showcase its All-New, fully electric BMW iX Sports Activity Vehicle,  which arrives in the US next month. The star-studded spot features  legendary actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Academy Award nominee Salma  Hayek Pinault, and was directed by two-time Academy Award nominated  director Bryan Buckley. It will air during the third commercial break  of the first quarter of the game.Schwarzenegger stars as Zeus, the Greek god of lightning, and Hayek  Pinault plays his wife, the goddess Hera, as they retire from Mt.  Olympus to a quiet life in Palm Springs, California.  However, the  monotony of retirement quickly weighs on Zeus, who becomes frustrated  by his struggles with earthly electronics and his nagging mortal  neighbors’ constant requests to charge their electric golf carts and  hedge trimmers. Meanwhile, Hera, the hero of the story, has fully  acclimated and is thriving in retirement. In an effort to bring some  excitement back into Zeus’s life, she gifts him with an all-electric  BMW iX, which quickly helps reignite her husband’s electric mojo. The  spot closes with the happy couple rocking down the road in their new  BMW iX to Eddy Grant’s “Electric Avenue” while Zeus uses his electric  power to change the traffic lights to green.“All-electric mobility is at the very heart of the BMW brand,” said  Jens Thiemer, senior vice president, customer and brand, BMW AG.  “There is no better place to make this statement than in front of one  of the largest television audiences in the world, where viewers tune  in as much for the commercials as they do for the game. With Arnold  and Salma, we are able show the world the new BMW iX in a memorable  and impactful way.”“The humor lies in this legendary god of lightning, who is supposed  to be indestructible, battling with everyday electronics,” said  Schwarzenegger. “It is only when his brilliant wife presents him with  the gift of an all-electric BMW iX that Zeus is struck with the mighty  power of electricity and is completely rejuvenated.”The spot was conceived by BMW’s lead U.S. creative agency, Goodby  Silverstein & Partners, and directed by two-time Academy Award  nominated director Bryan Buckley, highly acclaimed for his work on  more than 65 Super Bowl commercials. The ad also marks Hayek Pinault’s  debut in a Super Bowl spot and the first time she and Schwarzenegger  have costarred in a national ad.“This is my first Super Bowl commercial—and the first time I’ve  played a Greek goddess,” said Hayek Pinault. “Seventy-five percent of  the decisions made in a marriage about where to spend the money are  made by women, and in this commercial, it is the woman who decides on  the right car to get her husband back on track. Of course, the  commercial is entertaining, but there is also a real human truth to it.”“I’ve done 60-some-odd Super Bowl spots. I’ve never had more star  power than these two,” said director Bryan Buckley. “When I first saw   Schwarzenegger’s name on the script, I was in. And Salma—there is no  one greater as an actress. It’s a movie in 60 seconds, and it’s on the  biggest platform.”“Transcending sports, this iconic annual event isn’t just a  championship game. It’s a cultural phenomenon where viewers pay even  more attention when the action on the field stops,” said Rich  Silverstein, co-founder and co-chairman of Goodby Silverstein &  Partners. “There’s only one person on the planet who could say he’s  Zeus, and that’s Arnold. And there’s only one brand worthy of being  called the Ultimate Electric Driving Machine, and that’s BMW. We  needed to showcase this in a big way, and that is what we’re doing on  February 13.”Designed to provide more than just mortal mobility, the BMW iX brings  together the fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology with the  company’s latest developments in the fields of design, connectivity,  digital services and sustainability. With 516 hp and a 0–60 time of  only 4.6 seconds, the BMW iX offers an exhilarating driving experience  with an EPA estimate of up to 324 miles of all-electric range and the  latest in-vehicle technology, including 5G connectivity, a sweeping  curved display that unites the 12.3-inch information display with a  14.9-inch central control display, and the debut of BMW iDrive 8, the  company’s latest user-interface system. The BMW iX starts at $83,200  plus $995 destination and handling.“This is a pinnacle event in the U.S. and the perfect stage on which  to introduce the BMW iX to our customers,” said Uwe Dreher, vice  president, marketing, BMW of North America. “We have already seen a  significant number of preorders for both the BMW iX and BMW i4, and a  huge amount of excitement for these two new electric vehicles.”Alongside the BMW iX, BMW will also launch the fully electric BMW i4  four-door Gran Coupe in the U.S. next month as the company takes a  major step toward its stated goal of reaching global sales of 50%  electric vehicles by 2030.BMW’s last Super Bowl had appeared in 2015 and featured Katie Couric  and Bryant Gumbel as they marveled over BMW’s first fully electric  production vehicle, the BMW i3. The BMW i3 was a pioneer of  electromobility and later became one of the best-selling premium  electric vehicles in the world.

Sharper profile, authentic character: The new MINI Edition models.;All models to be launched together in March 2022: Resolute Edition for the MINI 3-door, the MINI 5-door and the MINI Convertible, Untold Edition for the MINI Clubman and Untamed Edition for the MINI Countryman. Exclusive design and equipment features deliver unmistakable charisma. ;Munich. MINI is raising driving fun, expressive  design, premium quality and individual style to a new level with its  new edition models for spring 2022. For the first time, all current  models of the tradition-steeped British premium car manufacturer will  be launched at the same time in a specific special edition. From March  2022, the MINI 3 door, MINI 5 door and MINI Convertible will be  released in the Resolute Edition. This edition is also available for  the MINI Cooper SE (combined power consumption: 17.6 – 15.2 kWh/100 km  according to WLTP; combined  CO2 emissions: 151 – 140 g/km WLTP) the MINI Cooper 5 door  (combined fuel consumption: 6.1 – 5.5 l/100 km; combined CO2  emissions: 139 – 126 g/km WLTP) and in the MINI Cooper S 5 door  (combined fuel consumption: 6.8 – 6.2 l/100 km; combined CO2  emissions: 154 – 141 g/km WLTP). It is also available in conjunction  with the all-electric MINI Cooper SE. Customers can enjoy open-top  driving pleasure in exclusive Resolute Edition style in the MINI  Cooper Convertible (fuel consumption combined: 6.4 – 5.9 l/100 km;  combined CO2 emissions: 144 – 134 g/km WLTP) and in the MINI Cooper S  Convertible (combined fuel consumption: 6.9 – 6.5 l/100 km; combined  CO2 emissions: 157 – 148 g/km WLTP).Appealing design features and colour  combinations.The exclusive design and equipment  features of the Resolute Edition reinforce the hallmark  characteristics of the MINI models and combine them with modern,  high-quality design accentuations. Exterior design features include  both a traditional-style colour scheme and no more chrome elements,  which will be a matter of course on future MINI models for reasons of  sustainability. The Rebel Green variant signals pure sportiness; this  was previously reserved exclusively for the top athlete MINI John  Cooper Works (fuel consumption combined: 7.1 – 6.8 l/100 km;" combined  CO2 emissions: 162 – 156 g/km WLTP). It is combined with a  Pepper White roof finish and Pepper White exterior mirror caps for the  MINI 3 door and MINI 5 door. On the MINI Convertible Resolute Edition,  the electrically operated soft top and the exterior mirror caps are  finished in black.Hallmark design features are finished in exclusive Resolute Bronze.  This includes the headlight surrounds, the radiator grille and rear  lights, the side scuttles on the front side panels, the handles of the  doors and tailgate and, on the MINI Cooper S, the air intakes in the  front apron and the fuel filler cap. The brand logos and model  lettering provide an attractive contrast, as do the inner frame of the  radiator grille, the tailpipe trim of the exhaust system and the  horizontal radiator grille strut of the MINI Cooper S in Piano Black.  On the MINI 3 door and the MINI 5 door in the Resolute Edition, there  is also a black strip running around the lower edge of the windows.Both the bonnet stripes and the door sill panels of the edition  vehicles feature a pattern of parallel lines with a colour gradient  between a light and a dark shade of gold as well as the lettering  """"RESOLUTE"""". The asymmetrical design gives them a  particularly high-quality and unconventional look in hallmark MINI  style. The discreetly sporty appearance of the edition vehicles is  completed by 18 inch alloy wheels in Pulse Spoke Black design. The  MINI Cooper SE features 17 inch alloy wheels in Electric Collection  Spoke design. Alternatively, 17 inch alloy wheels in Tentacle Spoke  Black design are offered for all models.The exclusive flair of the interior of the edition vehicles is  enhanced by sports seats in Black Pearl / Light Chequered  fabric/leatherette, which are combined with black armrests and knee  rolls. This colour scheme harmonises perfectly with the Rebel Green  paint finish and the black and gold exterior design features. The MINI  Yours Leather Lounge variant is also available on request in Carbon  Black with particularly striking stitching and piping as well as a  perforated Union Jack motif on the headrests. The Nappa sports leather  steering wheel bears an edition emblem on the lower spoke, and the  roofliner of the MINI 3 door and MINI 5 door models is in anthracite.Similar to the available seat options, the interior surfaces created  especially for the Resolute Edition emphasise the cars’ premium style.  Parallel and evenly curved lines in a light shade of gold form a noble  pinstripe pattern on the black background of the surfaces. At the same  time, they pick up on the structure of the bonnet stripes. The  specific design features are staged with the help of the lighting  package, whose LED units provide targeted interior illumination, as  well as with the Ambient Light, which also includes a laser-engraved  ring for the central instrument, light piping in the doors and cockpit  area as well as illuminated door handles and door entry areas. In  addition, the MINI Driving Modes are part of the equipment package for  the Resolute Edition.The Resolute Edition's exclusive design features make up a carefully  crafted package for premium exterior and interior style. They also tie  in particularly harmoniously with the clear and purist MINI design  language.  In the interior, the classic sporty flair of the colours  and materials is combined with advanced digital technology. The latest  generation of the MINI operating system optimises the quick and  intuitive control of vehicle functions, audio programme,  communication, navigation and apps. Live widgets on the 8.8 inch touch  display of the central instrument are used to activate the desired  menu item, which can be selected with a swiping motion similar to that  on a smartphone.The MINI Untold Edition: Sporty  understatement.The MINI Clubman is an exceptional  phenomenon in the premium compact segment. Its modern interpretation  of the classic shooting-brake concept combines tradition and  understatement with progressive and lifestyle-oriented  characteristics. The unique body concept with four doors, a  particularly long roofline and the split doors at the rear consisting  of two side-opening wings not only give the MINI Clubman an  extravagant appearance, but also provide a high degree of  functionality. Its interior offers seating for five and a generous,  variable storage volume that can be expanded from 360 to up to 1 250 litres.The Untold Edition emphasises the role of the MINI Clubman as the  stylish individualist in its class in an exclusive fashion. The  refined sophistication of its design is combined with a powerful  sports look in a new way. The Untold Edition is available for five  model variants. The range includes the MINI Cooper Clubman (fuel  consumption combined: 6.5 – 6.0 l/100 km"; combined CO2  emissions: 148 – 136 g/km WLTP), the MINI Cooper S Clubman (combined  fuel consumption: 7.1 – 6.7 l/100 km; combined CO2  emissions: 161 – 152 g/km WLTP), the MINI Cooper D Clubman (combined  fuel consumption: 5.2 – 4.8 l/100 km; combined CO2  emissions: 136 – 125 g/km WLTP) and MINI Cooper SD Clubman (combined  fuel consumption: 5.3 – 5.0 l/100 km; combined CO2  emissions: 139 – 130 g/km WLTP). In addition, the 225 kW/306 hp top  athlete MINI John Cooper Works Clubman (fuel consumption combined:  7.9 – 7.4 l/100 km;" combined CO2 emissions: 180 - 168 g/km  WLTP) is available in the Untold Edition.Distinctive body features, stylish interior  design.The unmistakable appearance of the MINI Clubman  is emphasised by the specific design features of the Untold Edition to  give it charismatic presence. The Sage Green metallic paintwork,  available for the first time on the MINI Clubman, and the distinctive  design of the front and rear aprons inspired by the John Cooper Works  Aerodynamic Kit provide a stylishly sporty look. The hallmark MINI  surrounds on the lower body sections are not in black as usual, but in  a dark shade of green for the first time. The five narrow, parallel  sport stripes running centrally across the bonnet and roof are also  specific features of the Untold Edition. The side scuttles,  manufactured using a high-quality 3D printing process, have a specific  stripe pattern. This exclusive graphic also features in the logo  projected from the door mirrors and on the door sill trims.The 18 inch alloy wheels in Untold Spoke design with bicolour  surfaces in the Jet Black/Refined Brass combination have also been  developed exclusively for the edition vehicles. The colour scheme,  which is based on refined brass, is also used for the radiator grille  surround and the radiator crossbar on the MINI Cooper S Clubman, MINI  Cooper SD Clubman and MINI John Cooper Works Clubman models, as well  as for the """"Clubman"""" lettering on the split doors at the  rear. A black paint finish for the roof and exterior mirror caps is  available as an option. The Piano Black exterior equipment with door  handles, exhaust tailpipes, MINI logos and model lettering in black is  an integral part of the Untold Edition.Sports seats in the exclusive MINI Yours Leather Lounge Sage Green  version transfer the powerful exterior character to the interior of  the edition vehicles. Light-coloured seams and piping as well as  textile inserts in the upper and outer areas of the seat backrests  create a particularly stylish seat surface look. Alternatively, sports  seats are also available in the MINI Yours Leather Lounge Carbon Black  variant. In the cockpit, illuminated accent strips in Sage Green and  exclusively designed interior surfaces with a subtle striped pattern  and green colour scheme are combined. Another stylish visual  accentuation are the surrounds of the air vents in Refined Brass. The  bottom spoke of the Nappa sports leather steering wheel as well as the  floor mats feature an edition emblem.The MINI Clubman in the Untold Edition also offers particularly  high-quality equipment in addition to the exclusive design features.  Beyond the standard equipment of the premium compact model, it also  includes Adaptive LED Headlights, the MINI Excitement Package and the  MINI Driving Modes as well as the anthracite-coloured roof lining and  the Interior Light Package.The MINI Untamed Edition: Ready for adventures beyond the city  limits.The biggest model in the MINI range is also the  most versatile: The MINI Countryman has established itself in the  premium compact segment as a particularly stylish all-rounder. Four  doors, a big tailgate, five seats and an exceptionally variable  interior with a luggage compartment volume of 450 to 1 390 litres  ensure a high degree of practicality. The optional ALL4 all-wheel  drive distributes power as required in all weather and road  conditions. The MINI Countryman handles everyday urban traffic just as  confidently as it does excursions that take it onto unpaved terrain.  It also plays a pioneering role on the path to particularly  sustainable mobility. The MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 (combined  fuel consumption: 2.1 – 1.7 l/100 km"; combined power consumption:  15.9 – 14.8 kWh/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 47 - 39  g/km WLTP) enables locally emission-free driving fun in city traffic  and beyond thanks to its plug-in hybrid drive. Its electric range,  determined in the WLTP test cycle, is up to 51 kilometres.The character of the explorer and adventurer is emphasised even more  intensively with the new Untamed Edition for the MINI Countryman. The  exclusive design and equipment features of the edition vehicles  highlight the robust look and off-road potential. The Untamed Edition  is available for the MINI Cooper Countryman (fuel consumption  combined: 6.9 – 6.2 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions:  157 – 142 g/km WLTP), the MINI Cooper S Countryman (combined fuel  consumption: 7.1 – 6.6 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions:  163 – 151 g/km WLTP), the MINI Cooper D Countryman (combined fuel  consumption: 5.2 – 4.7 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions:  137 – 124 g/km WLTP) and MINI Cooper SD Countryman (combined fuel  consumption: 5.5 – 5.1 l/100 km;" combined CO2 emissions:  144 - 134 g/km WLTP) and for the plug-in hybrid MINI Cooper SE  Countryman ALL4.Robust look, exclusive details.Thanks to its  exterior design specifically geared towards robust versatility, the  MINI Countryman in the Untamed Edition encourages you more than ever  to head out into nature and explore completely new roads and paths  spontaneously. Not only the exclusive Momentum Grey metallic paintwork  gives this MINI Countryman a unique appearance, but also the MINI ALL4  exterior look, whose specific trim elements are also finished in body  colour. The harmonious colour scheme emphasises the clear design  language of the MINI Countryman’s exterior. Both the lower air intake  surround including the suggested underride guard, the air curtain  inserts in the front apron as well as the side skirts, the reflector  inserts and the lower insert in the rear apron are painted in Momentum  Grey metallic. And a glance at the MINI brand logos on the bonnet and  tailgate reveals that the black lettering and graphic elements of the  emblem are also combined with a background in body colour. Four diagonal stripes, each in Frozen Bluestone, in the lower area of  the doors show that this car is ready to take on any road or path. The  18 inch alloy wheels in Untamed 2-tone design with burnished surfaces  have been developed exclusively for the edition vehicles. In addition  to the roof and the exterior mirror caps, the roof rails and the  headlight housings of the MINI Countryman in the Untamed Edition are  also finished in black. The Piano Black Exterior option, which is also  included in the equipment range of the edition vehicles, adds further  black design features. The surrounds of the radiator grille,  headlights, tail lights and side scuttles, the door handles, the  tailpipe trims, the model lettering and, if equipped accordingly, also  the ALL4 emblems on the front side panels.Like the door sills, the side scuttles feature a graphic pattern  inspired by a mountain landscape and the """"Untamed” inscription.  Corresponding lettering is also featured on the rear side windows. In  addition to the inlays and the carrier plates of the side scuttles,  the E logo on the tailgate of the plug-in hybrid model MINI Cooper SE  Countryman ALL4 is also in Frozen Bluestone.Nature-inspired shades of green and blue dominate the interior design  for the MINI Countryman in the Untamed Edition. The exclusive Highland  Green colour is combined with blue and green contrast stitching on the  surfaces of the sports seats in the MINI Yours Leather Lounge finish.  Alternatively, MINI Yours Leather Lounge Carbon Black trim is also  available. The illuminated decorative trim in Frozen Bluestone is  printed with a landscape pattern analogous to the door sill trims. For  the first time, a large-scale graphic serves as a motif in this area  of the interior instead of a uniform structure. An additional effect  is achieved by the """"Untamed"""" lettering visible in the night  design. The accent strips in the cockpit and on the centre console are  painted in Frozen Blue metallic, the door trim strips in Arctic Silver  metallic and the surrounds of the air vents in high-gloss black.In addition, the MINI Countryman edition model features emblems with  the """"Untamed"""" lettering on the seats and in the bottom spoke  of the Nappa sports leather steering wheel, floor mats with a  three-dimensionally embossed landscape pattern in the style of the  door sills and decorative trims and an anthracite-coloured roof  lining. The characteristic graphic of the mountain landscape also  adorns the discreet pins in the outer area of the seat backs in a  stylised form. The Untamed Edition for the MINI Countryman also  includes the Light Package, the MINI Excitement Package and the MINI  Driving Modes. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product Communications MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail julian.kisch@mini.comLaura-Marie Gaßner, Press Spokesperson MINI DesignTel.: +49-89-382-98114E-mail laura.gassner@bmwgroup.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.comThe BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the    BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles    and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility    services.

BMW Group France announces the first winning duo of BMW ART MAKERS, its new patronage programme in the field of visual arts and contemporary image-making. ;Artist Arash Hanaei and curator Morad Montazami have been named as winners of the BMW ART MAKERS programme. Following a call for applications, a shortlist was created by the jury members and the BMW ART MAKERS team, after which ten artist-curator duos were interviewed via video conference. ;Paris. Artist Arash Hanaei and curator Morad    Montazami have been named as winners of the BMW ART MAKERS    programme. Following a call for applications, a shortlist was    created by the jury members and the BMW ART MAKERS team, after which    ten artist-curator duos were interviewed via video conference.The jury unanimously selected the artist-curator duo Arash      Hanaei and Morad Montazami who won them over with their    project entitled “Hantologie post-urbaine” (“Post-urban    hauntology”). The dialogue fostered by the two applicants    demonstrated their synergy and the importance of the curator’s    contribution through his ability to take a step back when    considering the chosen subject. The jury was impressed by the first    series presented in the application that display the decision to    create an installation that combines various visual systems and a    masterful deep-dive into a futurist universe.“Hantologie post-urbaine” is a project that invites us to rethink    our relationship with the utopian architecture of the 1960s and    1970s and the urban ecosystem of the suburbs that host them. This    work is made up of still and moving computer images, evoking the    digital culture through which architectural ghosts pass. Their    socio-political ideal remains in a dream state, but lingers on    through their physical substance. The emphasis is on two parallel    worlds: the suburbs around the city and the virtual world created by    big data.“As winners of the 2022 BMW ART MAKERS programme, we are honoured    by the trust placed in us to successfully create an innovative    installation that proposes poetry and a visual policy that considers    the spectator’s emancipation, in an era of image “capture”, big data    and algorithmic warfare.” Arash Hanaei & Morad MontazamiThe BMW ART MAKERS programme will enable them to carry out      this project.Two heads are better than one.

Alongside the artist, the curator    performs the roles of artistic director, scenographer and designer    and ensures the project is completed to artistic standards,    timeframe and budget.“The human-machine relationship, creativity, innovation, support    and commitment are all key BMW Group values. In these unpredictable    times, this new art patronage programme speaks for itself: this    artist-curator duo sparks an emotional conversation with our society    and offers a different take through experimentation. We are looking    forward to seeing what Arash Hanaei and Morad Montazami have created    in relation to the post-urban and post-internet world,” Maryse    Bataillard, Head of Corporate Communications and CSR, BMW Group France. The shortlist and trends selected by the BMW ART MAKERS    jury. The jury, made up of Florence Bourgeois,    Director of Paris Photo, Hervé Digne, President of Manifesto,    Chantal Nedjib, Founder of L’image par l’image, and Christoph    Wiesner, Director of the Rencontres d'Arles, was supported in the    selection process for the first BMW ART MAKERS programme by renowned    figures in visual arts: Léa Bismuth, exhibition curator and art    critic, Jérôme Poggi, Galérie Jérôme Poggi, Nathalie Mamane Cohen,    Vice-President of Friends of the Centre Pompidou, and Maryse    Bataillard, Head of Corporate Communications and CSR, BMW Group FranceIn this new programme, the jury members will also act as mentors    and will monitor the project’s development throughout its creation process.The ten shortlisted duos were selected from 125 applicants who    submitted a proposal including a statement of intent, a budget and a    production schedule, scenography and images of their prior works.    These 125 applications demonstrated a wide range of profiles and    work. 43% of applicant duos were mixed, 35% were all-female and 22%    all-male. 47% were French and 53% international, from more than    thirty countries worldwide.The major trends that emerged reflected social issues. Many    projects considered the environment and in particular trees and    water. Society was the focus of proposals on post-colonialism,    feminism, disease and its resilience. Technology was also a common    theme, with a particular emphasis on artificial intelligence.Biographies of the winners Arash Hanaei is an artist who lives and works in    Paris. After growing up and studying in Tehran, he developed a    practice that combines several techniques and media. His series of    “digital drawings” entitled Capital (2009-2016) is a critical map of    the city of Tehran following  the Iran-Iraq war. His work gradually    shifted from documentary practices to inter-media speculations and    post-internet strategies. With the series Cyclothymia of a Land,    Hanaei further provokes dialectic thought between urban cityscapes    and digital landscapes, heightening his art of the visual palimpsest    (including modernist architecture, accounts of war or attacks, video    games, etc.). In recent years, his work has been displayed in solo    exhibitions: Poush Manifesto (Paris), Yassi Foundation (Tehran),    Goethe Institute (New York), etc. He has also contributed to group    exhibitions: Paris Museum of Modern Art (Paris), Palais de Tokyo    (Paris), Potsdam Art Space (Potsdam), MAXXI (Rome), etc. His works    are displayed in several international collections: LACMA Museum    (Los Angeles), Centre national des arts plastiques (France), Paris    Museum of Modern Art (Paris), Peters-Messer (Berlin), Salsali Museum    (Dubai), etc.Morad Montazami is an art historian, editor and    exhibition curator who lives and works in Paris.

MINI Italy supports the Biosphera Genesis housing module project as part of the MINI  Voices campaign.;MINI Italy renews its collaboration with Aktivhaus to promote the Biosphera Genesis project, a sustainable housing module focusing on human well-being and reducing the environmental impact of the building construction processes.    ;"Munich. With MINI VOICES, a platform has been created  to bring together personalities and initiatives that can contribute to  a more sustainable and socially responsible future, providing an  opportunity to promote revolutionary impulses and share them with a  wider global audience.Within this context, MINI Italy has chosen to collaborate with a  partner of excellence in the sustainability and construction sector:  Aktivhaus-Nexlogic Group. The company specialises in the development  of housing modules using the most advanced technologies in the world  focusing on human well-being and reducing the environmental impact of  the building construction processes. The collaboration between MINI  Italy and Aktivhaus began in 2018 and it is renewed today with the  presentation of the fourth generation of the Biosphera Project: Genesis.Mirko Taglietti, CEO of Aktivhaus and creator of the Biosphera  Project, said: ""Genesis is the fourth generation of the  self-sufficient regenerative biophilic housing module which has  already won the Energy Globe Award, the most coveted sustainability  prize in the world. Our main goal is to build and renew new-generation  buildings that put humans, their senses, needs, physiology, health,  and well-being at the center of the architectural and constructive  project. Buildings capable of regenerating its inhabitants’ minds and energy.”As a result of twelve years of research and scientific  experimentation in collaboration with numerous organisations,  universities, and companies, Biosphera Genesis is a 40 square meter  actual self-sufficient container of life - an itinerant living unit  that can be transported by road.  Biosphera Genesis, which was  inaugurated on 8 September 2021 in Venice on the island of San  Servolo, is the only housing module in the world to integrate  Biophilic Design, an architectural design feature aimed at creating a  favourable environment for human health. It is a ""passive""  house that produces eight times the energy consumed and consumes 95%  less energy than a traditional home. It was built using  environmentally friendly materials and adheres to the Minimum  Environmental Criteria (MEC).Stefano Ronzoni, Director of MINI Italy, said: ""We are delighted  to support Mirko Taglietti and the Biosphera Project. MINI truly cares  for the sustainability theme: the motto ‘BIG LOVE’ represents both the  love we have for others as well as love for the environment and  planet. We believe it is important to raise awareness for initiatives  such as this that can boost everyday life in a sustainable manner”.Biosphera Genesis is the first sensory growth chamber dedicated to  the hotel industry, designed to combat stress. Inside of it, the  visual, tactile and olfactory atmospheres found in nature are  recreated through immersive experiences, demonstrating how it is  possible to create an environment that positively affects our five  senses. From the use of technologies that recreate the same conditions  of light, temperature and colours between indoors and outdoors  respecting the circadian rhythm, to the use of a virtual reality that  reproduces sounds and scenarios existing in nature thanks to special  headphones. Finally, the presence of Swiss pine wood, as an olfactory  stimulator, helps the body to relax and to slow down the heartbeat.Biosphera is an Italian project born to merge medicine and  architecture, with sustainability at its core. Combining these  elements is the starting point for creating environments capable of  improving human health and lifestyle. Biosphera’s future is a protocol  that will be used to design hotels, schools, buildings of any kind and function.Biosphera Genesis was present at MINI’s BIG LOVE Days in Varano de’  Melegari from 2-3 October 2021. A MINI Cooper SE accompanied the  housing unit during its international launch at the Venice Biennale in  2021 as part of the Venice Innovation Design. The vehicle represents  MINI's response to the rising demand for sustainable and efficient  mobility and demonstrated the benefits of being able to recharge the  battery from the energy produced in excess by Biosphera Genesis.   In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsSarah Bauer, Press Spokesperson Product Communication MINITel.:  +49-89-382-94180E-mail: sarah.bauer@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com   The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Executive Personnel Change: Stefanie Wurst succeeds Bernd Körber as Head of MINI.;As of February 1st 2022, Stefanie Wurst takes over the management of the MINI brand. Her predecessor Bernd Körber will now head BMW Product Management and the Connected Company. Strategic further development of the British premium brand with a focus on new markets and target groups as well as electromobility and digitalization will be consistently continued.;"Munich. The BMW Group announces a personnel change at  the top of the MINI brand. As of 1 February 1st 2022, Stefanie Wurst  will take over the management of the British premium brand. She  succeeds Bernd Körber, who has held this position since April 2019 and  now assumes responsibility for the BMW Product Management and the  Connected Company as of February 1st 2022.Stefanie Wurst returned to Munich after being CEO BMW Group Nederland  since September 2018. Under her leadership, numerous sustainability  issues were actively promoted. Among others, she successfully  initiated the ""Electric City Drive"", which became a pilot  project for approximately 100 BMW eDrive Zones in Europe, which  support drivers of plug-in hybrid models in the use of the  all-electric driving mode in inner city areas. ""Sustainability is  a holistic task and an attitude that everyone feels committed  to,"" says Stefanie Wurst.The share of electrified models in the total sales of the BMW Group  in the Netherlands increased to a new record of 37 percent in 2021. At  the same time, the fully-electric MINI Cooper SE (combined power  consumption: 17.6 – 15.2 kWh/100 km according to WLTP, CO2 emissions  combined: 0 g/km) accounted for 21.5 percent of all new registrations  of the MINI brand in the Netherlands in the past year. At MINI this approach is reflected in an approach that considers  sustainability along the entire value chain, from the extraction of  raw materials to the production and operation of the vehicle to  subsequent recycling. MINI is making great strides in the expansion of  electromobility. In 2021, global sales of the fully-electric MINI  Cooper SE were almost doubled. As early as the early 2030s, MINI will  be making the transition to a fully electrified brand. Stefanie Wurst will contribute her experience in the field of  holistic corporate management in the interaction of all disciplines  and together with our trading partners. From 2014 to 2018, the  graduate economist was responsible for BMW's marketing of the German  automotive market. During this period, both the brand strength in  general and the perception of innovation of the BMW brand, including  the sustainability perception, increased. Prior to joining BMW Group,  she held various senior positions internationally, including in  Singapore for the Asian market. In her new role, she succeeds Bernd Körber, under whose direction the  future strategy of the MINI brand was developed. Among other things,  it includes a realignment of the product range, which includes  electrified models as well as new offers in the crossover and premium  compact segments. The next generation of the MINI Countryman will  roll-off the production line at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig from  2023 – with both electric and internal combustion engines. In  addition, MINI is stepping up its commitment to the Chinese automotive  market, including the launch of local production. Production of a new  generation of all-electric models from the brand will also begin there  in 2023. MINI is thus taking another step towards becoming an  all-electric brand.A central element of the realignment of MINI's brand image is the  emphasis on diversity, tolerance, cosmopolitanism, optimism and  enthusiasm for new things, which is expressed by the current campaign  motto BIGLOVE. The positive emotionality divides the brand with the  MINI community, in which individuality and a sense of community are  harmoniously in sync with each other. Innovations in the field of  digitalization and networking also contribute to the brand's future viability.This not only strengthens the relationship between customer and  vehicle, but also the brand's connection to the global MINI community.  With its strategic choices in the fields of product, brand and  customer as well as technology and production, MINI has a solid basis  for sustainable profitable growth of the brand.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Group significantly increases use of low-carbon steel in series production at European plants; BMW Group expands sourcing of low-carbon steel: Agreement with Salzgitter AG provides for delivery of low-carbon steel from 2026  Salzgitter AG and H2 Green Steel will meet more than 40% of steel demand for standard production at BMW Group’s EU plants, saving around 400,000 tonnes of CO2 per year  Steel remnants from plants will be reused in circular economy  Post: “Another important step in reducing CO2 emissions in the supplier network”  ;Munich. The BMW Group continues to reduce  CO2 emissions in its supplier network as part of its  ambitious ongoing sustainability activities. Steel produced using  natural gas or hydrogen and green power, instead of fossil resources  like coal, makes a vital contribution to this. The BMW Group has now  signed a corresponding agreement with Salzgitter AG for delivery of  low-carbon steel. The steel will be used in standard production of  cars at the BMW Group’s European plants from 2026 onwards. With this  move, the BMW Group is expanding its sourcing of low-carbon steel to  two suppliers. The aim is to use low-carbon steel to meet over 40% of  demand at its European plants by 2030, thereby reducing CO2  emissions by up to 400,000 tonnes per year.“This is an important step in substantially reducing CO2  emissions at source in the supplier network,” said Joachim Post,  member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing  and Supplier Network. “Our aim is to reduce vehicles’ lifecycle carbon  footprint with a holistic approach. With steel, in particular, we are  leading the way by sourcing low-carbon steel for our plants in Europe  in the future.”“Salzgitter AG is putting ‘circularity’ at the centre of its new  strategy,” said Gunnar Groebler, CEO of Salzgitter AG. “We firmly  believe that closed loops of recoverable materials can only realise  their full effect with strong partners. We are delighted about the  circular economy cooperation with the BMW Group and the agreement to  supply green steel to our long-standing customer. Partnering for  Transformation – this is how we will translate our new corporate  vision into practice.” Agreements with two suppliers on low-carbon steel will meet    over 40% of steel demand at European plants The BMW Group already signed an agreement with Swedish startup H2  Green Steel in October of last year. H2 Green Steel will supply the  BMW Group’s European plants with steel produced exclusively using  hydrogen and green power from renewable energies from 2025 onwards.  This process will reduce CO2 emissions by around 95%.Together, the two agreements will supply over 40% of the steel  required by the company’s European plants and save around 400,000  tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. BMW Group press plants in  Europe process more than half a million tonnes of steel per year. Gradual transition to low-carbon steel production Due to its energy-intensive manufacturing process, steel production  generates high CO2 emissions. However, because of its  versatility, steel is one of the most important materials for car  production and will continue to account for a large proportion of the  body and many components.To lower CO2 emissions from steel production on a massive  scale, Salzgitter AG is gradually switching to virtually carbon-free  production. Electricity from renewable sources and its use in  production of hydrogen from electrolysis are key elements of the  transformation. This green hydrogen will replace the coal currently  used in the conventional blast-furnace process. This is made possible  by so-called direct reduction plants, which use hydrogen to directly  reduce iron ore to iron in the solid state. The solid iron produced in  this way is then melted down with steel scrap in an electric arc  furnace powered by renewable electricity.Salzgitter AG plans to use this method to gradually reduce  CO2 emissions from steel production to around 5% of what  they originally were. Closed loop conserves resources and reduces CO2 emissionsThe BMW Group already established a closed-loop material cycle for  sheet steel waste from BMW Group Plant Leipzig with Salzgitter AG more  than five years ago. After delivering steel coils to the plant,  Salzgitter AG takes away steel remnants of the kind produced at press  plants, for example, when doors are punched out, and uses this  material to produce new steel. This steel is then supplied to the BMW  Group plants. In this way, raw materials can be used multiple times in  a circular economy, thereby conserving natural resources.Sheet steel waste from the BMW Group’s other European plants is also  either reused through a direct material cycle or sent back to the  steel producer via steel traders and processed into new steel. Use of secondary steel from circular economy reduces    CO2 emissionsUp to a quarter of the steel in BMW Group vehicles already comes from  recycling loops. The BMW Group plans to increase its percentage of  secondary steel in stages, reaching up to 50% by 2030.Since this requires significantly less energy, CO2  emissions from production of secondary steel are an average of 50-80%  lower than from primary steel. Investment in startups accelerates development of new    technologies In addition to sourcing low-carbon steel, the BMW Group has also  invested in an innovative method for carbon-free steel production  developed by American startup Boston Metal, through its venture  capital fund, BMW i Ventures. Boston Metal uses electricity for its  new technology, which, by means of an electrolysis cell, produces  molten iron that is later processed into steel. If electricity from  renewable energies is used for this process, then steel production is  carbon-free. Over the coming years, Boston Metal plans to expand the  new method for steel production on an industrial scale.Through its investment in startups, the BMW Group aims to accelerate  development of new technologies, promote competition and provide  impetus that will make it easier for young companies to enter the  market. Innovative technologies provide better, more sustainable and  more efficient access to raw materials.Investing in new technologies is one of many steps the BMW Group is  taking to meet its ambitious targets for the steel supply chain – for  example, by making low-carbon production an important award criterion  for every contract.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Tough test: BMW M Team RLL finishes the challenging 24 Hours of Daytona with both MOTUL BMW M4 GT3s.;The first 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) proved to be a tough test for the BMW M Motorsport teams and the new BMW M4 GT3. After a race full of challenges, BMW M Team RLL’s two MOTUL BMW M4 GT3s crossed the finish line in seventh and ninth places in the GTD-PRO class. ;Daytona. The first 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) proved to be a    tough test for the BMW M Motorsport teams and the new BMW M4 GT3.    After a race full of challenges, BMW M Team RLL’s two MOTUL BMW M4    GT3s crossed the finish line in seventh and ninth places in the    GTD-PRO class. Both cars suffered issues with their underbodies    early in the race. Work had to be carried out on the rear diffusor    multiple times which cost a lot of time and saw both cars drop well    down the field. Turner Motorsport made an impressive fightback in    the GTD class and was running in the top five until they were forced    to retire after an incident in the night. “That was a tough race,” said Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport.  “We wanted to keep the number of mistakes to a minimum and, if  possible, to get all the BMW M4 GT3s through the race without any  incidents. Unfortunately, we did not quite manage that. The GTD car  run by Turner Motorsport was unable to finish the race after contact,  and both of BMW M Team RLL’s cars encountered problems and ended the  race in seventh and ninth place. Although we did a lot of test  kilometres during the development phase, this showed that an outing  under race conditions poses additional challenges. We must work  together to improve the reliability, operations and performance, as we  were unable to match the pace of the leaders at any point in the race.  We will now analyse all the findings to ensure that we return to the  front again at the 12 Hours of Sebring. I would like to congratulate  Team Pfaff Motorsports on its victory in the first race of the new  GTD-PRO class. Today was my last race outing with BMW M Motorsport. I  would have liked to have bid farewell with a top result. I want to  thank all my colleagues, the teams and drivers for the trustworthy  cooperation over the past few years.” Sharing the driving duties in the #25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 were John  Edwards, Connor De Phillippi (both USA), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and  Jesse Krohn (FIN). They finished seventh in their class after 698  laps. The second car, with Philipp Eng (AUT), Sheldon van der Linde  (RSA), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) at the wheel, came  home ninth in the GTD-PRO class. In the GTD class, the #96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3 started from  the back of the field but they went on the offensive in the first few  hours and managed to fight their way back into the top five.  Alternating in the cockpit were Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley, Michael  Dinan (all USA) and BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER). The car  was damaged in a collision in the night however, and consequently had  to be parked up in the garage. BMW M Team RLL and Turner Motorsport now have roughly six weeks until  the second highlight of this season’s IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar  Championship at Sebring (USA). They will be joined there by Paul  Miller Racing with a BMW M4 GT3 in the GTD class. Focus on the BMW M anniversary and BMW M Endurance Challenge.On the support programme for the Rolex 24 At Daytona, BMW M  Motorsport and BMW of North America marked 50 years of BMW M with a  host of highlights. Immediately before the start of the race, there  was a parade of vintage and current BMW M cars, including a BMW M1  from 1980. Three race cars that made history by winning IMSA races  were on display at the Rolex 24 Heritage Exhibition in the Daytona Fan  Zone: the BMW 3.0 CSL from 1975, the 2015 BMW Z4 GTLM, and the BMW M8  GTE that triumphed at Daytona in 2019. The BMW M Endurance Challenge took place on Friday. The four-hour  race, round one of this season’s IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge, was  started by Timo Resch, Vice President Customer, Brand and Sales at BMW  M GmbH, in his role as Grand Marshal. Victory went to Team RS1. Turner  Motorsport also impressed with its two BMW M4 GT4s and made it onto  the podium, with Bill Auberlen and Dillon Machavern (both USA)  finishing third. Their team-mates Robby Foley, Michael Dinan and  Vincent Barletta (all USA) were fifth. Quotes after the 24 Hours of Daytona: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW M Team RLL): “That  was a long day for us. It was the first race with the new car for our  team. Prior to this, we had only had one short test at Daytona in  December 2021 and were a little surprised that we did not have the  problems back then that have slowed us down here in Rolex 24. A big  thank you goes to my team, the drivers, BMW M Motorsport, and all  those who never gave up during the past 36 hours and tried to get the  best possible out of the car. We now have a very long to do list which  we must work through in order to challenge at the front in Sebring.” John Edwards (#25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, 7th place    GTD-PRO class): “That was a difficult race for us from the  start. We did not have the necessary pace, and then came the issues  with the diffusor. The result is obviously not what we wanted, but I  am very proud of the guys, who never gave up. Seventh place still  earned us some decent points in the overall standings. Hopefully we  can up our game in Sebring and take a step forward in the championship.” Marco Wittmann (#24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, 9th place    GTD-PRO class): “That was not the race we were hoping for.  Despite that, we never lost our fantastic team spirit. After the early  problems, we tried to view the race as a test, gain experience and get  the car through to the finish. It is obviously a shame that we lost an  awful lot of time, first through the damage to the diffusor and then  later through a puncture and its consequences. Nevertheless, we have a  lot to build on looking ahead to the coming races. Hopefully things  will run smoother in the future!” Jens Klingmann (#96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3, DNF GTD  class): “For the IMSA season, the 24 Hours of Daytona is  pretty much the equivalent of the Super Bowl – the highlight of the  season and a really tough test at the same time. There were four of us  in one Turner Motorsport car for the first time, and we had fought  back strongly to make it into the top five until our retirement. My  team-mates were all basically very happy with the driveability,  user-friendliness and ergonomics of the BMW M4 GT3. That gives me  reason to be positive. It is obviously a shame that we had to park the  car up after our contact, but we showed that we have the potential to  compete at the very front of the field in our class.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The new BMW M4 GT3 is set to make its debut at the endurance classic in Florida.;Daytona. For BMW M Motorsport and BMW of North America, this weekend’s    Rolex 24 At Daytona (USA) represents one of the highlights of the    season, even this early in the year. The new BMW M4 GT3 is set to    make its debut at the endurance classic in Florida. BMW M Team RLL    and Turner Motorsport were in action last weekend at the test and    qualifying event, Roar Before the 24, where they secured their start    positions for the 24-hour race. The big race is the perfect stage on    which to mark the 50-year anniversary of BMW M GmbH, which will    celebrate the occasion with a top-class programme both on and off    the track. The sporting foundations for the coming weekend were laid over the  last few days, within the many test sessions and the 100-minute  qualifying race. The two MOTUL BMW M4 GT3s run by BMW M Team RLL  qualified 12th and 13th in the GTD-PRO class. At the wheel of the #24  car were BMW M works drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Nick  Yelloly (GBR), gaining as much experience as possible. Their  team-mates Marco Wittmann (GER) and Philipp Eng (AUT) were only in  action in the test sessions. In the #25 car, Augusto Farfus (BRA) and  Jesse Krohn (FIN) skipped the qualifying race, while John Edwards and  Connor De Phillippi (both USA) shared the cockpit. Turner Motorsport,  with drivers Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley, Michael Dinan (all USA) and  Jens Klingmann (GER) in the #96 BMW M4 GT3, failed to finish in the  GTD class following a collision. As a result, they will start from the  back of the field at the weekend. “The 24 Hours of Daytona is a very special race for BMW M Motorsport  in many regards – and for me personally,” said Mike Krack, Head of BMW  M Motorsport. “For the first time this season, the 50-year anniversary  of BMW M will be duly celebrated, thanks to the efforts of BMW of  North America at the racetrack. From a sporting perspective, we are  extremely excited about our IMSA debut with the BMW M4 GT3. We have  already seen at the Roar that setting up and classifying a totally new  GT car can pose challenges that need a little time to master. However,  the drivers and teams are constantly making progress and will continue  to improve over the course of the race weekend. I am confident that we  will see good performances at my final race as Head of BMW M  Motorsport. I am really looking forward to it.” MOTUL is partner of BMW M Motorsport and lends its name to the BMW M  Team RLL cars. “After two years of successful partnership, including  the 2020 24h Daytona win, we are very proud to continue our adventure  together,“ said Romain Grabowski, Head of Brand MOTUL. “This is not  only a partnership renewal, it is a real challenge for our two  companies with the introduction of the brand new MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 as  we have both been working together on its technical development. We  are hoping to provide BMW fans from all over the world with great  excitement as well as top quality engine oil, allowing them to extract  maximum power output from their BMW engines while benefiting from  maximal protection.” Fellow partners Akrapovič, H&R, Michelin and  Puma are also working closely with BMW M Motorsport. They are joined  by BMW of North America’s partners BMW M Performance Driving School  and Global Medical Response and BMW M Team RLL’s partners Aero and Rousseau. Special highlights in support programme.As well as the race action, BMW M Motorsport and BMW of North America  will also mark 50 years of BMW M with a host of highlights on the  support programme for the Rolex 24 At Daytona. Directly before the  start of the race, there will be a parade of vintage and current BMW M  cars, including a BMW M1 from 1980. Three race cars that made history  by winning IMSA races will be on display at the ‘Rolex 24 Heritage  Exhibition’ in the ‘Daytona Fan Zone’: the BMW 3.0 CSL from 1975, the  2015 BMW Z4 GTLM, and the BMW M8 GTE that triumphed at Daytona in 2019. Once again, BMW M is also the title partner of the BMW M Endurance  Challenge, the 4-hour race that kicks off the season in the IMSA  Michelin Pilot Challenge. Four BMW M4 GT4s run by the Turner  Motorsport, Stephen Cameron Racing and Random Vandals Racing teams  will compete in the race on Friday. The field will be led by BMW M3  and BMW M4 safety cars. Attending as representatives of BMW M GmbH are  CEO Franciscus van Meel and Timo Resch, Vice President Customer, Brand  and Sales at BMW M GmbH. The BMW M Endurance Challenge gets underway at 19:35 CET on Friday  28th January. The Rolex 24 starts at 19:40 CET on Saturday 29th January. Quotes ahead of the 24-hour race: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW M Team RLL): “We are  very proud to have played a role in a good portion of the history of  BMW M Motorsport. For us, signing with BMW back in 2008 for the 2009  season was a huge honour – so for us to be part of this 50th  anniversary of BMW M is really something special. We are super excited  about racing the new BMW M4 GT3, once again introducing a new race car  to BMW fans like we have done with the M3 GT, Z4 GTLM, M6 GTLM and M8  GTE. We have been fortunate to have success with each of those cars  which makes it exciting to embark on this new project and hopefully  have more success with this great new chassis in 2022. BMW M  Motorsport has assembled another great driver line-up and our drivers  will have to give us their best. There are a lot of good drivers in  GTD PRO and we’re looking forward to the competition.” Sheldon van der Linde (#24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “Not a  great qualifying race for us. Obviously, we would have liked to be  further up on the grid. Our job is to make sure that everything runs  smoothly within the team. For me personally it’s the first race with  the RLL team, so I was getting to know everybody during these days. My  first time with BMW M Motorsport at Daytona means there’s a lot left  for me to learn.” Nick Yelloly (#24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “We could see in  the qualifying race where we are at the moment – and that’s not where  we want to be. Now we have to stick our heads together in the days to  come. In general, it’s pleasure to drive the BMW M4 GT3 and work with  BMW M Team RLL. Now we just have to find some speed.” John Edwards (#25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “The qualifying  race didn’t end up great but fortunately there are no points awarded  for it. Now we have a week ahead of us where we’ll put our heads down  and prepare for the 24-hour race to go for the result when it counts.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “Not the  result we wanted, obviously. We executed well and had a clean race. We  just didn’t have the package to challenge for top positions. Let’s  hope it will be different next weekend and we can put on a fight.” Jens Klingmann (#96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3):  “For us the focus was on set-up work. It’s important to find a good  balance between racing day and night. There are still a lot of things  to learn and discover with the new car. I think we made good progress  and the car is in a good window. It is easy to drive which is  important for a 24-hour race. Now we just got to make it fast. I am  confident we’ll get there soon.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The new BMW 8 Series Coupé, the new BMW 8 Series Convertible, the new BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé.;Fresh impetus for BMW sports cars in the luxury segment. New BMW 8 Series Coupé, new BMW 8 Series Convertible and new BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé with striking design modifications to the exterior and detailed interior design enhancements. Clear emphasis on performance characteristics, stylish appearance and exclusive character combined with optimised connectivity. New BMW 8 Series heralds continuation of the brand’s current model offensive in the luxury car segment. Limited edition model THE 8 X JEFF KOONS as the emotional highlight of the new edition.;With striking design modifications to the exterior and an interior  that has been further developed in numerous details, premium carmaker  BMW has honed the profile of its luxury sports cars. A redesigned  front section makes for an exterior look that is as dynamic as it is  elegant. In addition, all model variants of the new BMW 8 Series  Coupé, the new BMW 8 Series Convertible and the new BMW 8 Series Gran  Coupé come with an M sports package as standard. This means that the  interior likewise conveys an even more intensely focused impression of  driving pleasure. Operating convenience and connectivity are optimised  by an enlarged 12.3-inch Control Display for the BMW iDrive system.More than ever, the luxury sports cars of the BMW 8 Series embody a  passion for inspiring performance and exclusive style. The BMW “Iconic  Glow” kidney, which is standard on all model variants, now adds a  particularly expressive accentuation to the exterior. On the inside,  the BMW Individual Merino leather upholstery – now a standard feature  – contributes to the luxurious ambience.Luxury sports car in three body variants.The new edition of the BMW 8 Series provides a particularly emotional  boost for the brand’s current model offensive in the luxury  performance segment. There are three individual vehicle characters to  choose from, each of them offering its own distinctive interpretation  of this fascinating combination of sporty flair and luxury. The BMW 8  Series Coupé embodies the classic two-door body shape, so it stands  firmly in the tradition of the brand’s legendary sports cars, blending  elegant lines with dynamic driving characteristics. The BMW 8 Series  Coupé was developed in parallel with the BMW M8 GTE endurance racing car.The BMW 8 Series Convertible combines sporting performance with the  very highest level of exclusivity as well as the distinctive appeal of  open-top driving pleasure. Its classic textile soft top can be opened  or closed fully automatically in 15 seconds at the touch of a button.The series is rounded off with a vehicle concept that combines  typical BMW dynamic performance with a clear bonus in terms of space  and long-distance suitability. As a four-door model with an  exceptionally high level of seating comfort in the rear for a sports  car, the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé occupies an exceptional position in  the luxury segment. Its outstanding performance characteristics result  from the fact that it is the only model in its competitive field to  have been derived directly from a two-door sports car – the BMW 8  Series Coupé.A choice of three engines, rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive.There are several options when it comes to choosing an individual  experience of the exclusive dynamic performance offered by a BMW 8  Series – not only in terms of the diversity of vehicle concepts but  also based on drive technology. Three engines are available for each  of the luxury sports cars. At the top of the model range are the BMW  M850i xDrive Coupé (combined fuel consumption: 10.8 – 10.5 l/100 km; combined  CO2 emissions: 251 – 243 g/km according to WLTP). These  models put the power of their 4.4-litre, 390 kW/530 hp V8 engine on  the road with the help of intelligent all-wheel drive.The 3.0 litre in-line 6-cylinder petrol engine in the BMW 840i xDrive  Coupé models (combined fuel consumption: 8.9 – 8.6 l/100 km; combined  CO2 emissions: 204 – 195 g/km according to WLTP) and the  BMW 840i xDrive Convertible (combined fuel consumption:  9.2 – 8.8 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 209 – 200 g/km  according to WLTP,) and the BMW 840i xDrive Gran Coupé (combined fuel  consumption: 9.3 – 8.7 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions:  211 – 199 g/km according to WLTP) transmits its drive torque to all  four wheels. Alternatively, the 245 kW/333 hp engine can also be  combined in the BMW 840i Coupé models (combined fuel consumption:  8.6 – 8.2 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 196 – 186 g/km  according to WLTP,) the BMW 840i Convertible (combined fuel  consumption: 8.8 – 8.4 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions:  201 – 191 g/km according to WLTP) and the BMW 840i Gran Coupé  (combined fuel consumption: 8.9 – 8.4 l/100 km; combined  CO2 emissions: 203 – 191 g/km according to WLTP) with  classic rear-wheel drive.Pulling power, efficiency and superior driving pleasure characterise  the drive technology in the BMW 840d xDrive Coupé (combined fuel  consumption: 6.8 – 6.5 l/100 km; combined CO2 emissions:  179 – 170 g/km according to WLTP) and the BMW 840d xDrive Convertible  (combined fuel consumption: 7.0 – 6.7 l/100 km; combined  CO2 emissions: 183 – 175 g/km according to WLTP) and in the  BMW 840d xDrive Gran Coupé (combined fuel consumption:  7.1 – 6.7 l/100 km;" combined CO2 emissions: 186 – 174 g/km  according to WLTP). Its 3.0-litre in-line 6-cylinder diesel engine  generates a maximum output of 250 kW/340 hp. The spontaneous power  delivery, fuel consumption and emissions response of the turbo diesel  power unit are additionally optimised by the use of 48-volt mild  hybrid technology. THE 8 X JEFF KOONS: Precision, sophistication and    craftsmanship in a limited edition.The design style and dynamic performance of the new BMW 8 Series are  fascinating – not only on the road. For US artist Jeff Koons, they  serve as sources of inspiration for the edition of the BMW M850i  xDrive Gran Coupé he has designed, which will be presented for the  first time on 17 February 2022. THE 8 X JEFF KOONS embodies precision,  sophistication and craftsmanship. A multi-layer finish in eleven  colours creates a highly expressive appearance. Meanwhile the  interior’s impressive ambience is characterised by the very finest  leather and other exquisite materials, along with the rich red and  blue tones of BMW M GmbH and an engraved artist’s signature.Jeff Koons and the BMW Group are linked by a partnership that dates  back more than a decade. In 2010, he designed the BMW M3 GT2 Art Car  that took part in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This new project came about  to mark the 50th anniversary of the BMW Group’s global commitment to  culture. The limited edition is manufactured at the BMW Group plant in  Dingolfing. This makes THE 8 X JEFF KOONS an exceptionally exclusive  combination of art and driving pleasure in a luxury sports car by BMW.Exterior design. Fresh accents for fascinating dynamic performance.Strikingly designed surfaces and precisely traced lines ensure sporty  elegance in the body design of the three models of the BMW 8 Series in  line with the brand’s current design style. Their appearance signals  dynamic performance, exclusivity and progressive aesthetics.  Regardless of the body shape, the BMW 8 Series stands for an  unmistakable style that makes a lasting impression. Just a few weeks  after the market launch of the third body variant, the entire BMW 8  Series was awarded the “Golden Steering Wheel” as the “Best-Looking  Car of the Year” based on a reader survey by Auto Bild and    Bild am Sonntag.The BMW 8 Series Coupé comes over as a low-slung vehicle with an  elongated silhouette and a roof line that flows elegantly into the  powerful rear. A widely flared shoulder section and wide track widths  signal the dynamic driving potential of the two-door model. Its roof –  optionally made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) – features a  central indentation reminiscent of the double curvature known as the  “double bubble” in classic racing cars.The BMW 8 Series Convertible also features dynamic lines with its  tight-fitting tension-bar soft top. The soft top lies flat in its  compartment when opened. When the roof is open, the harmonious design  of the exterior and interior comes into full view. The vehicle’s  occupants are surrounded by coherently designed surfaces that extend  from the dashboard to the door sills and from the rear to the soft-top compartment.In addition to its distinctive proportions, the exterior design of  the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé also features characteristically designed  side sections and rear. In addition, the four-door model has a  wheelbase that is 201 millimetres longer than that of the BMW 8 Series  Coupé at 3 023 millimetres.Redesigned vehicle front, M sports package as standard.The extensively modified design of the new BMW 8 Series Coupé, the  new BMW 8 Series Convertible and the new BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé lends  even more intense emphasis to the performance character and  extravagant presence of these luxury sports cars. All model variants  are now equipped with an M sports package as standard. As a result,  they have aerodynamically optimised body features finished in body  colour in the area of the front and rear apron as well as on the side  skirts. The large lower air intakes at the front are now structured by  horizontal struts. The diffuser insert in the rear apron is finished  in Dark Shadow metallic. The now even sportier appearance is rounded  off with 19-inch M light alloy wheels in double-spoke design and  fitted with mixed tyres. In addition, the standard equipment now  includes an M sports brake system with callipers finished in blue.The three particularly powerful V8 models BMW M850i xDrive Coupé, BMW  M850i xDrive Convertible and BMW M850i xDrive Gran Coupé likewise  continue to come off the production line with M specific design  features. In addition, they now feature aerodynamically optimised M  exterior mirrors for the first time – in a design that was originally  developed exclusively for the high-performance sports cars of the BMW  M8 series. Furthermore, the airflow is guided even more precisely by a  front spoiler attachment, and on the new BMW M850i xDrive Coupé also  by an M rear spoiler. In addition, the standard equipment of the three  top models in the range includes a particularly powerful version of  the M sports brake system, the M sports differential and 20-inch M  light alloy wheels in Y-spoke design with mixed tyres. These features  are also included in the optional M Sports Package Pro for the  6-cylinder models of the new BMW 8 Series.In addition, like the new M Performance Package for the 8-cylinder  models, it includes the M High Gloss Shadow Line with extended  features, brake callipers in black, the M Shadow Line lights with dark  inserts – available for the first time – and a black M rear spoiler  for the BMW 8 Series Coupé.To mark the 50th anniversary of BMW M GmbH, all models in the new BMW  8 Series are also offered with an option that indicates a special link  with traditional motor racing enthusiasm. As an option, all models of  the new BMW 8 Series have the classic “BMW Motorsport” logo on the  bonnet, tailgate and wheel hub covers instead of the usual BMW  emblems. With its staggered semicircles in blue, purple and red, the  anniversary emblem is reminiscent of the original BMW M GmbH trademark  that was first used on racing cars in 1973.BMW kidney grille with illuminated surround, new exterior    paint finishes.Adaptive LED headlights with variable light distribution, adaptive  cornering lights and the anti-dazzle high-beam assistant BMW Selective  Beam come as standard in these luxury sports cars. As an optional  extra, the BMW laser light is offered with a particularly long high  beam range. In addition, the BMW kidney grille between the headlights  now adds a striking accentuation to the front of all models in the new  BMW 8 Series. It comes as standard with the BMW “Iconic Glow”: the  waterfall lighting for the two kidney grille elements creates a  particularly extravagant expression when the new BMW 8 Series is  viewed from the front. The illumination is activated as soon as the  vehicle is opened and can be switched on or off manually by the driver.In addition, the brand’s signature cooling air intake features  redesigned kidney bars with a distinctive U-profile. An M logo on the  BMW kidney grille of the BMW M850i xDrive Coupé, BMW M850i xDrive  Convertible and BMW M850i xDrive Gran Coupé is a reference to  membership of the BMW M model family as well as to the performance of  the V8 engine installed behind the radiator grille.There is a choice of four new exterior body finishes for the luxury  sports cars. Skyscraper Grey metallic, San Remo Green metallic, M  Portimao Blue metallic and BMW Individual Frozen Tanzanite Blue  metallic are additional variants that give individual emphasis to the  modern design style of the exterior.Furthermore, additional versions of the optionally available M light  alloy wheels in 20-inch format are available for the new BMW 8 Series  models. Meanwhile, new 20-inch M Performance light alloy wheels are  likewise offered as part of the range of Original BMW Accessories for  the 8-cylinder models in the series.Interior and equipment. Luxurious sports car ambience redefined.In designing the interior of the BMW 8 Series models, a unique  balance was achieved between driver-oriented dynamic performance and  exclusive elegance. The overall ambience of the interior combines  driving pleasure, modern aesthetics and individual luxury. One  defining element of the interior design is its forward-facing lines.  This is further accentuated by the standard Ambient Light, which  stylishly illuminates the contours of the dashboard and door sills.An M leather steering wheel with multifunction buttons and shift  paddles for manual gear selection of the 8-speed Steptronic Sport  transmission now comes as standard in all the new BMW 8 Series models.  In the BMW M850i xDrive Coupé, the BMW M850i xDrive Convertible and  the BMW M850i xDrive Gran Coupé, the M leather steering wheel features  a model-specific centre spoke design along with decorative stitching  in the colours of BMW M GmbH. Rising towards the dashboard at the  front and clearly separating the driver and front passenger areas, the  wide console also helps create a strikingly sporty atmosphere.In the BMW 8 Series Coupé – as in the BMW 8 Series Convertible –  there are two rear seats, each with the distinct character of a single  seat. The second row of the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé not only offers  particularly generous legroom: between the two outer seats with  pronounced contours and integrated headrests, it also offers a third  seat that can be used on short journeys and comprises a fully-fledged  seat belt system. This means that the four-door luxury sports car is  in fact designed as a 4+1 seater. Its standard equipment now also  includes 4-zone automatic air conditioning with separate temperature  and air volume control for the rear.Multi-function seats and BMW Individual Merino leather    upholstery with extended features now standard in all model variants.The M sports package – which is standard in all models of the new BMW  8 Series – also gives the interior an aura that is geared towards  focused driving pleasure. Other contributing factors in addition to  the M leather steering wheel are the anthracite-coloured M roof liner,  the M pedals in stainless steel, the M driver’s footrest and specific  floor mats. The illuminated door sill trims and the display in the  instrument cluster feature the BMW M Automobile model inscription  “M850i” and the M logo respectively. In conjunction with the M Sports  Package Pro for the 6-cylinder models and the M Performance Package  for the 8-cylinder models, the interior design is complemented with  black seat belts bearing accent stripes in the colours of BMW M GmbH.In addition, the basic equipment of the 6-cylinder model variants has  been extended to include the multifunction seats previously only  standard in the BMW M 850i xDrive Coupé, the BMW M 850i xDrive  Convertible and the BMW M 850i xDrive Gran Coupé. The multifunction  seats offer not only excellent lateral support during dynamic  cornering but also a high level of long-distance comfort. Their range  of functions includes a lumbar support. The headrests are visually  integrated in the backrests and can be adjusted both in height and  depth as required. Adjustment of the seat position, backrest width and  thigh support is electrically operated. The memory function for the  driver’s and front passenger’s seats is also a standard feature.The multifunction seats are combined with BMW Individual Merino  leather upholstery with extended features. The latter is available in  a variety of colours, including particularly stylish Bicolor versions.  The surfaces of the dashboard and door sills are also upholstered in  leather as standard.The galvanised surfaces of the side air vent surrounds and the accent  strips in the area of the door openers are also harmoniously  coordinated, allowing the door openers to be particularly stylishly  integrated as closed clasps. Matching this, the controls for the  electrically operated window lifts, door lock and seat memory function  integrated in the door sills now also feature electroplated surfaces  in all models of the BMW 8 Series.BMW Live Cockpit Professional now with a Control Display    enlarged to 12.3 inches.The standard equipment of the new BMW 8 Series Coupé, the new BMW 8  Series Convertible and the new BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé includes the  BMW Live Cockpit Professional.

The highly distinctive design of the BMW X2  projects a sense of athleticism that accurately reflects the car’s  sporty driving properties. It also ensures the X2 cuts a visually  alluring figure and stands out from the crowd in the premium compact  segment. The Sports Activity Coupé (SAC) fuses individual lifestyle  attributes with modern functionality and the driving pleasure for  which BMW is renowned. Its powerfully expressive front end, the  flowing lines of its flanks and the BMW logo on each C-pillar  recalling classical BMW coupés from years past also bring visual  uniqueness to the BMW X model family. And from March 2022, the new BMW  X2 Edition GoldPlay will introduce a heightened sense of extrovert  appeal to urban areas and beyond. The new special edition underscores  the singular character of the BMW X2 and combines equipment  highlights, such as the extended M High-gloss Shadow Line, the “X2”  logo projection from the driver’s side mirror or the optionally  available Adaptive LED Headlights including a four-segment matrix  high-beam headlight function, turning lights and adaptive light  distribution, with exclusive exterior details and special interior  appointments that add an extra layer to an already richly engaging  driving experience.The new BMW X2 Edition GoldPlay will be offered with all the drive  system variants available for the compact SAC.

Added to which, a large, three-section lower air intake  in the front apron, front and rear bumper panels with inserts in Dark  Shadow, wheel arch trim and lower door edging in body colour, M  High-gloss Shadow Line trim and the M Aerodynamics package give the  car a muscular appearance. The surrounds for the side windows, window  recess covers, B-pillar trim and embellisher surrounds on the  C-pillar, mirror cover panels and mirror frames (incl. mirror  triangle) are finished in High-gloss Black on the special-edition car,  as are the exhaust tailpipe finishers and border for the BMW logo on  the tailgate.Adorning the front of the car is the M Mesh kidney grille in  High-gloss Black whose mesh structure is inspired by racing cars. The  styling extravagance that marks out this special-edition X2 is  headlined by the use of the exclusive colour shade Galvanic Gold for  the kidney grille surround and exterior mirror caps. Eye-catching  inserts in Galvanic Gold also adorn the 19-inch M aerodynamic wheels  of the special-edition car. 20-inch M aerodynamic wheels are available  as an option, and likewise come with Galvanic Gold inserts.New exterior colours, striking foliation.The exterior colour San Remo Green metallic is  reserved exclusively for the GoldPlay Edition.

The M leather steering  wheel with multifunction buttons, anthracite-coloured headliner, M  stainless steel pedals, M driver’s footrest and car key with  distinctive M identifier underscore the sporting instincts of the  special edition. Judiciously placed accents create a stylistic  connection with the exterior design. These include door sill strips  which have a surface structure derived from the BMW kidney grille’s  mesh design and bear “Edition” lettering in Galvanic Gold. Around the  instrument panel on the front passenger side of the cabin, the Dark  Graphite matt trim strips – likewise a bespoke design for the GoldPlay  Edition – display a graphic referencing the exterior foliation. For  the first time, a laser engraving technique is used, which applies the  graphic in the colour Golden Mica metallic on the surface of the strip  and seals it with clear varnish.Another highlight of the bespoke interior appointments for the  special-edition model are the M sport seats with particularly  prominent side bolsters and integral head restraints for the driver  and front passenger. These are trimmed in an exclusive Dakota leather  trim variant. The black leather surfaces of the driver’s seat and  front passenger seat are perforated through the centre section of the  backrests.

Recharged and electrifying: the classic Mini launches into the future.;Originating from a dedicated team at MINI Plant Oxford, sustainable driving fun is now being created in a classic car. An electric motor for the original Mini combines tradition with pioneering technology - all in the spirit of circular economy.;Munich. If Alec Issigonis could design the classic  Mini again today, the iconic small car would have an electric motor.  After all, the original launched in 1959 was created during an oil  crisis and based on the idea of saving fuel and transporting four  occupants and their luggage in the smallest possible footprint. To  this day, MINI remains linked to the principles of designer Issigonis  with its creative use of space and driving fun. The MINI Recharged  project is an opportunity to continue telling the story of the classic  Mini in the 21st century, in a sustainable way.The conversion of classic Minis to an electric drive combines  traditional values with future-oriented technology. The idea was born  even before the British premium manufacturer had a fully electric car  on offer with the MINI Cooper SE (electricity consumption  combined:17.6 - 15.2 kWh/100 km according to WLTP;" the company has a global    sales network in more than 140 countries.In 2021, the BMW Group sold over 2.5 million passenger vehicles    and more than 194,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax    in the financial year 2020 was € 5.222 billion on revenues amounting    to € 98.990 billion. As of 31 December 2020, the BMW Group had a    workforce of 120,726 employees.The success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term    thinking and responsible action. The company set the course for the    future at an early stage and consistently makes sustainability and    efficient resource management central to its strategic direction,    from the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase    of all products.www.bmwgroup.comFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/BMWGroupTwitter: http://twitter.com/BMWGroupYouTube: http://www.youtube.com/BMWGroupViewInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bmwgroupLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/bmw-group/""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
In 2021 BMW Motorrad achieves the best sales result in its history with an increase of 14.8 percent. ;194.261 BMW motorcycles and scooters were delivered to customers worldwide.;"Munich. BMW Motorrad finished the year with a record  sales result despite major challenges. With 194,261 units (+14.8%),  2021 was the best year since BMW Motorrad was founded (previous year: 169,272).Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: ""The fact that we  still managed to finish 2021 with this fantastic result for BMW  Motorrad not only makes me happy, but also incredibly proud. It’s  precisely in times of crisis where you can see how well a team sticks  together. This year, I would therefore like to express my special  thanks to all employees as well as to the BMW Motorrad business  partners, who made this success possible thanks to their personal  commitment and flexibility. My sincere thanks also goes to our  customers for their loyalty, trust and support.""Strong sales growth in Europe and Asia.Europe showed strong sales growth in 2021. Italy (16,034 units /  +15.2 %), Spain (12,616 units / +14.4 %) and France (19,887 units /  +13.4 %) were the most important growth drivers and able to  continuously increase their sales figures. In total, 9,100 more  vehicles were delivered in Europe, including Germany, than in the  previous year. The Asian market is also continuing to expand. China  (14,309 units / +21.4%) is also one of the strongest growth and volume  markets in Asia with double-digit growth. India continues to develop  strongly, posting an absolute top result with a growth of 102.5% and a  remarkable 5,191 units.Stable sales in Germany at a slight minus. Germany remains by far the largest single market for BMW Motorrad.  With 25,972 units sold, BMW Motorrad will again defend its position as  the most successful motorcycle manufacturer in the German market in 2021. Encouraging developments in the USA and Brazil.The market in the USA also developed very positively for BMW Motorrad  in 2021. With 16,030 motorcycles and scooters sold (previous year:  12,135 units), BMW Motorrad achieved an impressive +32.1% growth in  the USA. Sales in Brazil are not growing quite as fast, but they are  increasing steadily. With 11,150 vehicles sold (previous year: 10.707  units) and a growth of +4.1%, the South American market is among the  top 7 BMW Motorrad markets in 2021.Brexit has no noticeable impact on motorcycle sales.Fortunately, the UK's exit from the EU had no significant impact on  the fun of riding on two wheels. With an increase of 26.6% and sales  of 9,263 units in Great Britain/Ireland (previous year 7,315 units),  the British market is proving to be stronger than ever before.Boxer models remain the driving force.A total of over 60,000 units of the two touring enduros R 1250 GS and  GS Adventure alone, were delivered to customers in 2021. Sales of the  traditionally strong R Series increased significantly overall. Thanks  to the new top-of-the-line R 1250 RT tourer and the four emotional BMW  cruisers from the R18 model family, sales figures in the flat-twin  boxer segment once again grew strongly, accounting for around half of  the total 194,261 vehicles sold.First M motorcycle sets sporty and technological standards.The BMW M 1000 RR was the first true M motorcycle from BMW Motorrad  to enter the market in 2021. With 1,070 units sold and numerous  sporting successes on the racetracks of this world, this powerful  sports motorbike once again underlines the high innovative strength  and passion of BMW Motorrad. A clear commitment to the sporty  four-cylinder is demonstrated not only by the S 1000 RR and S 1000 XR,  but also by the S 1000 R, which was launched in 2021 and which  achieved an excellent result with 4,796 units sold following its  comprehensive update.Looking ahead at 2022.Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: ""I look forward to 2022  with great confidence as we start the year with what is sure to be the  strongest product offering ever. Our four cruiser models from the BMW  R 18 model family are entering their first full year of sales  together. In addition, in the first few months of 2022 alone, the  market launches of the all-electric BMW CE 04 and our four superior  6-cylinder models K 1600 GT/GTL/B and Grand America, which have been  further improved in all respects, are absolute highlights in our range  and will generate a further sales drive in the first half of the year.  We also have a lot planned for the second half of 2022, so our  customers and fans are in store for a number of surprises."" You will find further press material on BMW motorcycles and BMW  Motorrad rider equipment in the BMW Group PressClub atwww.press.bmwgroup.com.In case of queries please contact:Gerhard Lindner, BMW Motorrad CommunicationTelephone:  +49-151-601-53472, gerhard.la.lindner@bmw.deTim Diehl-Thiele, Head of Communication BMW MotorradTel.:  +49-151-601-57505, tim.diehl-thiele@bmw.deJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-151-601-35108, jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.comInternet: www.press.bmw.deE-mail: presse@bmw.deThe BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

For this important  project, we need drivers who really know BMW M Motorsport, the cars,  the engineers, the race series and circuits, and who can concentrate  fully on regularly squeezing the best possible performance from the  overall package. We are convinced that we are ready for the 2022  season with our line-up.” Details about the driver allocations for the relevant BMW M  Motorsport teams and race series will be announced at a later date. The BMW M Motorsport driver line-up no longer includes Martin Tomczyk  and Maximilian Günther (both GER). Tomczyk has called time on his  racing career and is pursuing new professional challenges, while  Günther is competing for Nissan in the ABB FIA Formula E World  Championship. BMW M Motorsport would like to thank both drivers for  the time spent together. The BMW M Motorsport works drivers 2022 in alphabetical order: Nick Catsburg (NED)Date of        birth15

The new flagship from BMW M Motorsport has passed the    endurance test in the desert. Following test races last season and    successful FIA homologation, the 24H Dubai (UAE) from Friday to    Saturday marked the first race appearance for the new BMW M4 GT3 in    the hands of BMW M Motorsport teams. ST Racing and Schubert    Motorsport competed with a total of three BMW M4 GT3s at the    season-opener in the 24H Series. After 24 hours of racing featuring    numerous Code 60 periods and a sandstorm on Saturday morning, all    three cars reached the finish line on their racing debut.  ST Racing secured ninth place with the #28 BMW M4 GT3 in the top  category, the GT3 class. The car was driven by Jon Miller (USA), Nick  Wittmer (CAN), Louis-Philippe Montour (CAN) and Chandler Hull (USA).  Schubert Motorsport suffered a setback early in the race when the #30  BMW M4 GT3 was damaged after contact from another competitor. The  subsequent long repair break saw the #30 fall way back. After 24  hours, BMW M works driver Nick Yelloly (GBR), Jordan Witt (GBR),  Marcel Lenerz (GER) and Jens Liebhauser (GER) crossed the line tenth  in the GT3 class. The #1 car from ST Racing, competing in the Pro-Am class, was the  best-placed BMW M4 GT3 in the field for a large part of the race and  was on course for a podium in its class. However, a technical problem  then cost the car positions, although it was possible to carry out  repairs. The #1, driven by Samantha Tan (CAN), Bryson Morris, Anthony  Lazzaro, Harry Gottsacker and Tyler Maxson (all USA), then finished  fifth in the Pro-Am class. The next highlight for the BMW M4 GT3 is scheduled to take place in  two weeks in North America. At the season-opener in the IMSA  WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series), the legendary 24  Hours of Daytona (USA), BMW M Team RLL and Turner Motorsport will be  competing with the new GT car. BMW M Motorsport teams were also competing in Dubai with the BMW M4  GT4 and the BMW M2 CS Racing. They secured multiple podium finishes in  their categories. The RHC Jorgensen-Strom by Century team reached  third place on the rostrum with the #450 BMW M4 GT4 in the GT4 class.  The #429 of Century Motorsport and the #451 from Team AVIA Sorg  Rennsport were right behind in fourth and fifth positions. In the TCX  category, Cogemo/TLRT finished second with the #255 BMW M2 CS Racing,  ahead of Yeeti Racing with the #208 BMW M2 CS Racing in third  position. Schubert Motorsport claimed sixth place in the same class  with the #200 BMW M2 CS Racing. Reactions to the 24H Dubai. Achim Klein, BMW M Motorsport Project Lead BMW M4 GT3:  “Those were some exciting days for us here in Dubai. The  first official racing appearance for a new car is always something  special, and even though the turbulent events during the race meant  that the final results did not entirely meet our expectations, we can  draw some positive conclusions. Two of the three competing BMW M4 GT3s  were brought to Dubai straight from production, where they were  received by the BMW M Motorsport teams. We also gathered plenty of  valuable knowledge in Dubai, which will help us as we continue to work  on the new car in its debut season. ST Racing and Schubert Motorsport  provided crucial input for this. Now we are looking forward to the  next highlight with the new BMW M4 GT3, the 24 Hours of Daytona in two weeks.” Kenneth Tan, ST Racing Team Principal: “The BMW M4  GT3 is potentially very competitive.

I wish Andreas Roos luck and am in no doubt that BMW M  Motorsport will be successful under his leadership.” Andreas Roos adds: “I’m very much looking forward to my new role and  thank BMW M GmbH for the trust they have shown in me.

BMW Motorrad reveals R 18 M and R 18 Aurora at the Verona Motor Bike Expo. ;Exclusive custom bikes were developed by two famous Italian customizers with support of BMW Motorrad Italia and the dealer network.;"Munich/Verona. The Verona Motor Bike Expo has been  the perfect stage to bring to the eyes of Italian and European  enthusiasts two exclusive motorcycle customization projects based on  the iconic BMW R 18.These are the result of the collaboration of BMW Motorrad Italy  and its dealer network with some of the historical players of this  world.The R 18 M is a project developed by Italian Magazine LowRide  and created by American Dreams. The R 18 Aurora, was created by Garage  221 that was engaged by BMW Motorrad Roma.BMW R 18 M.M is the letter that distinguished the sport versions of BMW  four-wheeled models, and today it also includes two-wheeled vehicles.  The source of inspiration for the BMW R 18 M project by the editorial  staff of LowRide is the following: the idea is to give the BMW Cruiser  a more streamlined and sportier look, avoiding exaggerations and  especially without forgetting the reference to the BMW R 18 retro lines.""Stability, long wheelbase and readiness of the 1800 cc big  boxer instigate lightning starts and deserve, in our opinion, a sporty  and retro look. In the R 18 M design, we find suggestions from BMW  Motorrad tradition and cues from the four-wheelers: M stands for  Motorsport” as Giuseppe Roncen, director of LowRide and a great expert  of the world of specials, described the BMW R 18 M project.The work has focused on chassis, suspension set-up, bodywork,  and accessories, leaving mechanics and electronics unchanged as the  natural strengths of the R 18. Lightened and with a different riding  position, the BMW R 18 M promises to be even more fun to ride:  ""We remain curious to experience its potential. Significantly  lightened, the bike should also be easy to handle due to its riding  position, which is more compact and forward loaded, without exaggeration.""Built by many hands, from designers to experienced craftsmen.The R 18 M project was made possible by BMW Italia and was born  in the wake of the emotions that this bike can give: a fun cruiser,  powerful and lively, with a big heart and an infinite torque. LowRide  has involved some of the best Italian craftsmanship and companies  specialized in the sector. The realization of the sketches was  entrusted to designer Oberdan Bezzi, already a partner of LowRide in  the past. He has managed to make it an exciting power cruiser without  upsetting the essence of the BMW R 18. American Dreams handled the  assembly and coordinated the work";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW i Ventures Invests in Y Combinator Alum HeyCharge to Amplify EV Charging Rollout at Residential Locations;HeyCharge’s Technology Cuts Costs and Increases Scalability of Charging Options Underground;"Munich/ Mountain View, Calif. BMW i Ventures announced today  a lead investment in HeyCharge, the German start-up democratizing  access to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in apartment  complexes, office buildings and other infrastructure locations.  HeyCharge was in Y Combinator’s Summer 2021 batch of start-ups. “The rapid growth of the electric vehicle market in coming years will  necessitate greater infrastructure build-out of charging solutions  around the globe,” said Kasper Sage, Managing Partner, BMW i Ventures.  “HeyCharge is the first company to enable EV-charging without internet  connection, which is a key enabler to cover untapped white-spots. With  HeyCharge's technology, it becomes attractive to install chargers in  locations that before would have not been commercially viable."" Traditionally, EV chargers require an app or RFID card and a proper  internet connection to begin activation. Yet most underground garages  currently do not have an internet access point, or the ability to  install such boxes. Chris Cardé, Founder and CEO, HeyCharge,  recognized the problem with this traditional system and the  opportunity to solve it after bringing his first EV home to a Munich  apartment building. As the amount of EVs on the road increases – by  2040, virtually every new car sold globally will be electric – there  will be a large need for a scalable charging option that fits into  consumers' everyday lives. With 56% of Germany and 46% of Europe living in apartment  buildings, and 37% of renters in the US, this is an obvious next step  for the expansion of EV charging stations, but the current reliance on  internet connectivity is holding scalability back. That’s why  HeyCharge has made its mission to help get a cheap, commercial,  scalable solution to this section of the population.  HeyCharge’s patent-pending technology, SecureCharge, eliminates the  need for an on-site internet connection, allowing the app and chargers  to communicate directly over bluetooth with the HeyCharge App or SDK.  This maximizes availability of the system while minimizing latency  between the phone and the charger. When combined with Access Point,  HeyCharge’s simple and effective hardware component, total costs can  be reduced up to 80% in buildings. “In addition to our full wallbox, the HeyCharge Access Point is a    bring your own wallbox device that places the bare minimum  for access control and consumption invoicing on the building side,  allowing for a fast and easy installation that can be made by any  electrician in minutes,” said Chris Cardé, Founder and CEO, HeyCharge.  “We are excited to use this investment to scale our product globally  and bring low-cost charging options to consumers.” HeyCharge’s  solution makes EV charging not just scalable but also more  cost-effective and accessible so that easy EV charging is made  possible wherever you live or work, said Chris Cardé, Founder and CEO,  HeyCharge. “We are thrilled to be working with BMW i Ventures in this  round and look forward to using this investment to scale our product  globally and bring low-cost charging options to consumers.”  About BMW i Ventures BMW i Ventures is BMW Group’s venture capital firm, investing money  and resources in startups in the fields of Transportation,  Manufacturing, Supply Chain and Sustainability.

BMW M GmbH enters its anniversary year with a new sales high.;Sales growth continued in 2021 – BMW M GmbH was the global market leader in the performance car and high-performance car segment for the third year running – Spotlight in the brand’s 50th anniversary year centres on the latest round of new products, alluring special-edition models and the next stage in the electrification offensive.;Munich. For the third time in a row, BMW M GmbH ended  the financial year as the global market leader in the performance and  high-performance car segment. Indeed, the company posted record sales  once again in 2021. A total of 163,542 BMW M cars were delivered to  customers worldwide last year, a 13 percent increase on 2020.This growth was spread equally between the High-Performance sports  cars and Performance cars made by BMW M GmbH, with both product  categories raising their sales figures to a new level. “This success  is the perfect start to our anniversary year,” says Franciscus van  Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “M is in a stronger position than ever as it  celebrates its 50th birthday.”New BMW M3 and new BMW M4 enjoy immediate success.The biggest drivers of growth among the High-Performance sports cars  were the new BMW M3 and BMW M4 models introduced in spring 2021.  Fuelled by a vehicle concept focused squarely on emotionally charged  dynamism and unprecedented diversity in the model range, the new BMW  M3 Sedan (fuel consumption combined: 10.2 – 10.0 l/100 km [27.7 – 28.3  mpg imp]; CO2  emissions combined: 233 – 231 g/km as per WLTP) got off to an  extremely successful start. The latest model generation is the first  to offer customers two output levels topping out at 375 kW/510 hp, the  M xDrive all-wheel-drive system and a choice of either a six-speed  manual gearbox or the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission.“The response to the new generation of the BMW M3 and BMW M4 has been  simply overwhelming,” reports Timo Resch, Vice President Customer,  Brand and Sales at BMW M GmbH. “We can therefore expect demand for  these iconic sports cars to continue on an upward curve in 2022.”Also making a powerful contribution to the latest rise in  High-Performance model sales at BMW M GmbH were the BMW X5 M  Competition (fuel consumption combined: 13.6 – 13.3 l/100 km [20.8  – 21,2 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 308 – 303 g/km as  per WLTP) and BMW X6 M Competition (fuel consumption combined:  13.4 – 13.1 l/100 km [21.1 – 21.6 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions  combined: 305 – 299 g/km as per WLTP). Following the successful market  launch of the latest model generation the previous year, the  charismatic High-Performance sports cars in the Sports Activity  Vehicle and Sports Activity Coupé segment – both powered by a 460  kW/625 hp V8 engine – increased their sales figures once again in 2021.Alluring and in demand: the BMW M models in the BMW 4 Series range.The dynamic excellence, agility and precision for which M is renowned  also enabled the brand’s Performance models to delight and excite a  wide range of customers over the past year. Credit for the latest  boost to sales goes above all to the M models based on the new BMW 4  Series. Particularly popular were the variants of the new BMW 4 Series  Coupé, whose line-up consists of the BMW M440i Coupé (fuel consumption  combined: 8.1 – 7.4 l/100 km [34.8 – 38.2 mpg imp]; CO2  emissions combined: 184 – 167 g/km as per WLTP) and BMW  M440i xDrive Coupé (fuel consumption combined: 8.2 – 7.5 l/100 km  [34.5 – 37.7 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined:  186 – 170 g/km as per WLTP) powered by a 275 kW/374 hp six-cylinder  in-line petrol engine, and the BMW M440d xDrive Coupé (fuel  consumption combined: 6.3 – 5.7 l/100 km [44.8 – 49.6 mpg imp];  CO2 emissions combined: 165 – 150 g/km as per WLTP), whose  six-cylinder in-line diesel unit produces 250 kW/340 hp.The latest BMW X models within the ranks of M’s Performance cars also  proved extremely desirable. Indeed, the BMW X3 M40i powered by a  six-cylinder in-line engine with 265 kW/360 hp (fuel consumption  combined: 9.5 – 8.8 l/100 km [29.7 – 32.1 mpg imp]; CO2  emissions combined: 216 – 199 g/km as per WLTP) and the BMW X7 M50i  (fuel consumption combined: 12.8 – 12.3 l/100 km [22.1 – 23.0 mpg  imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 292 – 280 g/km as per WLTP)  with its 390 kW/530 hp V8 unit both posted an increase in new registrations.Looking ahead to an anniversary year brimming with highlights.BMW M GmbH will continue its product offensive in this anniversary  year with the addition of new High-Performance and Performance models.  Highlights include the new BMW M240i xDrive Coupé (fuel consumption  combined: 8.8 – 8.1 l/100 km [32.1 – 34.9 mpg imp]; CO2  emissions combined: 200 – 185 g/km as per WLTP) and the arrival later  in the year of the first BMW M3 Touring and an exclusive  special-edition model based on the new BMW M4 Coupé.In addition, the BMW Group subsidiary – which was founded as BMW  Motorsport GmbH in May 1972 and enjoys the status of an independent  manufacturer – will also drive the transformation to electric  mobility. Following in the tyre tracks of the BMW i4 M50 (electric  power consumption combined: 22.5 – 18.0 kWh/100 km as per WLTP;  CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km) in the first half of 2022  will be the likewise fully electric BMW iX M60 (projected electric  power consumption combined: 24.7 – 21.7 kWh/100 km as per WLTP;"  CO2 emissions combined: 0 g/km).The most powerful BMW M model ever made points the way to the    future of the brand.The anniversary year will be crowned by the start of production of  the BMW XM. The most powerful BMW M car ever to go into series  production is also the brand’s first High-Performance model to employ  a plug-in hybrid drive system. Its newly developed M Hybrid technology  brings together a V8 engine and a high-performance electric motor to  develop maximum output of 550 kW/750 hp and peak torque of 1,000 Nm  (737 lb-ft). The design of the BMW XM majors on presence and extrovert  appeal and in so doing sends out a clear statement in the luxury segment.“Our first standalone model since the legendary BMW M1 represents a  complete re-imagining of the high-performance car segment,” says van  Meel. “The BMW XM blends expressive design and progressive interior  luxury with an incomparable driving experience that serves up both  sublime performance and the ability to glide along in near silence in  all-electric mode. In so doing, it provides an inimitable expression  of poise and assurance, and at the same time points the way to the  future of our brand.”""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Electro-offensive and number one in premium segment: BMW Group posts strong sales for 2021;The BMW Group posted solid year-on-year sales growth of 8.4 percent last year, with a total of 2,521,525 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles delivered to customers worldwide. BMW sales reached a new all-time high of 2,213,795 units (+9.1%) last year, with the brand leading the global premium segment.; Munich. The BMW Group posted solid year-on-year sales  growth of 8.4 percent last year, with a total of 2,521,525 BMW, MINI  and Rolls-Royce vehicles delivered to customers worldwide. BMW sales  reached a new all-time high of 2,213,795 units (+9.1%) last year, with  the brand leading the global premium segment. The company more than  doubled its sales of fully-electric vehicles in 2021 to 103,855 units (+133.2%). “Despite supply bottlenecks and the continuing coronavirus pandemic:  We achieved a strong sales performance in 2021, thanks to a powerful  operational performance and stellar product line-up. Our brands  reported numerous all-time best sales results around the globe –  spearheaded by the BMW brand, which is number one in the global  premium segment,” said Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management  of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands, Sales. “With more than  100,000 fully-electric vehicles sold last year, ramping up  electromobility was our clear focus,” Nota continued.  BMW Group well positioned to continue profitable growth in 2022The company is optimistic about the current year. “In 2022 we want to  continue our profitable growth and we will systematically expand our  range of fully-electric vehicles. We have set ourselves particularly  ambitious growth targets in this area and aim to more than double our  sales of fully-electric vehicles from last year,” Nota added. Systematic digitalisation of customer interface paves the way    for sales success in the future With the introduction of the BMW iX and BMW i4, the BMW Group has  significantly expanded its digitalisation of the customer interface. For instance, as well as offering intuitive configuration to simplify  the purchasing process, pre-configured new vehicles and newer used  cars across the entire model range can already be bought online in the  BMW Group’s domestic market of Germany. By 2025, the company plans to  sell around a quarter of its vehicles entirely online. Data-based recognition of service requirements enables proactive  customer care. This means the customer can be contacted directly and  receive assistance remotely, wherever possible, or a visit to the  workshop can be set up easily and efficiently, if needed. The new My BMW/MINI app offers even more additional features, such as  booking of digital services or broad access to charging options, and  also provides a direct channel to customers. BMW sales surpass all-time high of pre-crisis year 2019The BMW brand ended 2021 with global sales up 9.1 percent (to  2,213,795 vehicles) on the previous year. Thanks to its young and  attractive product line-up, BMW achieved its highest-ever sales figures. 2021 dominated by electromobility offensiveIn 2021, 13 percent of BMW and MINI vehicles sold worldwide – a total  of 328,316 units (+70.4 %) – were already electrified. In Europe it  was already more than 23 percent (225,415 units). With 37,939 BMW iX3* vehicles sold in 2021, about one in ten BMW X3  vehicles delivered to customers worldwide was fully electric. During  this same period, one in three customers worldwide who bought a MINI 3  door model opted for the model’s fully-electric variant* (34,851  units). At the same time, the BMW i3, the world's only fully-electric  premium vehicle in the compact segment, continued to grow in its ninth  year: With 28,216 vehicles sold, 5.4 percent more BMW i3 vehicles were  sold than in the previous year. The BMW Group released two key innovation flagships, the BMW iX and  the BMW i4, onto the market late last year. In 2022, the company will  further expand its electric line-up with fully-electric versions of  the BMW 7 Series and BMW X1 and, in 2023, the high-volume BMW 5  Series. These will be joined by other models, including the successor  to the MINI Countryman and the all-electric Rolls-Royce Spectre. By 2023, the company will have at least one fully-electric model on  the roads in about 90 percent of its current market segments. Over the  next ten years or so, the company plans to sell a total of about ten  million fully-electric vehicles. The Neue Klasse, which is uncompromisingly geared towards  fully-electric drivetrains, will make a significant contribution to  BMW Group sales volumes from the middle of the decade onwards. The MINI brand’s product range will be exclusively all-electric by  the early 2030s, while Rolls-Royce will also be an all-electric brand  from 2030 onwards. All future new models from BMW Motorrad in the  field of urban mobility will be fully electric. Another milestone in the success story of BMW M GmbH With a total of 163,542 M vehicles (+13.4%) delivered to customers,  BMW M GmbH once again posted all-time record sales in both the  high-performance and performance segments. The new BMW M3 and BMW M4  performed especially well. Sales of the BMW X5 M and BMW X6 M Sports  Activity Vehicles also increased year-on-year. In the performance  segment, growth came mainly from the new 4 Series derivatives – and  the 4 Series Coupé, in particular. The X3 M40i* and X7 M50i* also  enjoyed growing popularity. This year, the fully-electric BMW iX M60*  and BMW i4 M50* models will further contribute to the future success  of the brand. One in ten MINI customers worldwide already drives fully electricThe MINI brand delivered 302,144 vehicles to customers last year –  3.3 percent more than in 2020. Around 17 percent of these vehicles had  an electrified drive train. More than one in ten MINI customers opted  for the fully-electric MINI: the MINI Cooper SE* (34,851 units). The  MINI Electric is the MINI family’s highest-volume model and was a  driving force for the brand in 2021, delivering growth of 98.2 percent  worldwide. With a planned realignment of the model range, expansion of  production capacity and development of new target groups and markets,  the MINI strategy will remain focused on successful, profitable growth  going forward. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars posts highest sales in its historyRolls-Royce Motor Cars reported the highest sales in the brand’s  117-year history, with 5,586 units sold worldwide (+48.7%). This  overall figure includes all-time record sales in most regions,  including Greater China, the Americas and Asia-Pacific, and in  multiple countries across the world. The past year was characterised  by high demand worldwide for all models, particularly Ghost and  Cullinan and all Black Badge variants, with current orders extending  well into the third quarter of 2022.  Bespoke commissions were at  record levels and the company announced, alongside the launch of Boat  Tail, that Rolls-Royce Coachbuild would become a permanent fixture in  its future portfolio. The marque continues to evolve as a true luxury  house and now prepares for the historic market introduction of its  first all-electric motor car, Spectre, in the fourth quarter of 2023. 2021: Best year ever for BMW Motorrad With 194,261 units (+14.8%) delivered to customers, 2021 was BMW  Motorrad’s best year ever. As in previous years, sales growth was  assured by the BMW 1250 GS, which once again made a vital contribution  to the success of the brand in 2021, with around 60,000 units sold.  The all-new BMW R 1250 RT got off to a good start in the marketplace,  as did the large R 18 models, with four derivatives presented so far.  The new S 1000 R was also very well received: Together with the first  BMW M model for BMW Motorrad, it brought fresh energy to the  four-cylinder scene and demonstrated BMW Motorrad’s technology leadership. BMW & MINI sales in the regions/marketsIn China, the BMW Group once again posted a new all-time sales high  in 2021 and continues to lead the premium segment. A total of 846,237  BMW and MINI vehicles were delivered to customers in China (+8.9%).  Sales of electrified vehicles in China continued to gain momentum with  growth of 69.6 percent and more than 21,000 units of the BMW iX3. The  company’s fifth-largest market, South Korea, also increased its sales  by 11.0 percent in 2021, with 77,592 units sold. In the US, BMW brand deliveries climbed 20.8 percent to 336,644 units  and were therefore on a par with the pre-crisis year 2019. The MINI  brand sold 29,930 vehicles in the US in 2021 – an increase of 6.4  percent compared to the previous year. The BMW X model range accounted  for 60 percent of total US sales last year. In Europe, total sales figures for BMW and MINI reached 948,087 units  (+3.9%). Belgium marked a historic first for the company, as the BMW  brand led a country’s total market in Europe for the first time. The  Netherlands also posted an all-time high: The BMW iX3* was the  best-selling electric model in the premium segment, with 2,733 new  vehicle registrations. The BMW Group continued to grow its segment share in its domestic  market of Germany, with 267,917 units delivered (-6.8%) in 2021, and  leads the premium segment, with a market share of over 35 percent.  Sales of fully-electric vehicles more than doubled (27,248 new vehicle  registrations). Including the 43,842 PHEVs that were sold, a quarter  of all vehicles delivered in Germany were already electrified.    BMW Group sales in Q4/YTD December 2021 at a glance  4th Quarter 2021Compared with previous year %YTDDecember 2021Compared with previous year %BMW Group Automotive 589,301-14.2%2,521,525+8.4%BMW 510,727-15.1%2,213,795+9.1%- BMW M GmbH 40,540-7.0%163,542+13.4%MINI 77,306-8.5%302,144+3.3%BMW Group electrified* 96,741+26.9%328,316+70.4%Rolls-Royce 1,268+14.8%5,586+48.7%BMW Motorrad37,652-5.1%194,261+14.8%*BEV and PHEV  BMW & MINI sales in the regions/markets 4th Quarter 2021Compared with previous year %YTD December 2021Compared with previous year %Europe 223,167-15.8%948,087+3.9%62,745-26.4%267,917-6.8%Asia 232,222-17.1%1,065,141+8.2%176,600-18.9%846,237+8.9%Americas 120,838-5.2%450,062+18.9%100,891-6.0%366,574+19.5%*Provisional registration figures The delivery figures reported in this press release are provisional  and may change up until the BMW Group Report 2021 is published.

BMW first to bring digital art into vehicles. Artist Cao Fei creates Digital Art Mode.;On the occasion of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), BMW will present its Digital Art Mode and will be the first to bring digital art into vehicles. Internationally renowned Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei created the Digital Art Mode in the year of the 50th anniversary of BMW Cultural Engagement. Held in Las Vegas from January 5 8, 2022, CES will be the first event to showcase the Digital Art Mode inside a BMW iX M60.;Las Vegas. On the occasion of the Consumer  Electronics Show (CES), BMW will present its Digital Art Mode and will  be the first to bring digital art into vehicles. Internationally  renowned Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei created the Digital Art  Mode in the year of the 50th anniversary of BMW Cultural Engagement.  Held in Las Vegas from January 5‑8, 2022, CES will be the first event  to showcase the Digital Art Mode inside a BMW iX M60.The Digital Art Mode is part of the all-new My Modes: Their unique  moments enhance BMW’s driving experience by creating a synergy of the  vehicle’s functions and its interior design. Depending on the driving  situation and the overall mood, a holistic user experience featuring  both a functional and an emotional level can be created at the touch  of a button or via voice control. To that end, drive control and  steering control, mood lighting and sound as well as the color scheme  and graphics of the BMW Curved Display are precisely synchronized.A quantum leap for BMW Cultural Engagement: After 50 years and  hundreds of international cooperations, BMW will now introduce art  into its vehicles. The novel Digital Art Mode offers an additional  option for drivers to personalize their driving experience according  to their preferences and interests and enjoy culture in their mobile  day-to-day lives. The Digital Art Mode is the result of an intensive  collaborative process of BMW Group Design and the Chinese multimedia  artist Cao Fei, whose art creates fascinating and sensual, immersive  moments. In 2017, Cao Fei designed the 18th BMW Art Car using the M6  GT3, the first of its kind to be entirely digital in the history of  this unique collection of mobile artworks. With this very first  incorporation of digital art in an automobile, Cao Fei and the BMW  Group are now taking the next step together.The new BMW iX M60 home to a premiere: a digital artwork    symbolizing the deep connection of humankind and  nature.For the very first time, the Digital Art Mode  can be experienced in the new BMW iX M60 at this year’s CES. The  feature will be made available for other BMW series vehicles in 2022.  Selected models will be available with the Digital Art Mode as a  customized optional feature configurated directly ex work, while  others can be retrofitted via remote software upgrades integrated into  the user interface. “With the new Digital Art Mode, BMW Cultural  Engagement reaches new heights while creating something entirely  unique,” said Christoph Grote, Senior Vice President Digital Car,  BMW Group, “For the very first time, we are making digital art an  integral part of the modern driving experience in a car and use  innovative technology to transform mobility into an individual, highly  exclusive and emotional experience.”The artwork to be presented on the BMW Curved Display and created by  Cao Fei, speaks of the continuous change of a globalized and  interconnected world and is named “Quantum Garden”. Galaxies of visual  spaces filled with dots, light beams and nebulae constantly moving  towards and away from each other at varying speeds while growing and  shrinking again and again. They express the mostly invisible but  continuous links connecting people, groups and systems that affect  each other even over great distances and, in doing so, also modify  their surroundings. In her artwork – produced especially for the  Digital Art Mode – Cao Fei combines her reflections on these global  connections and correlations with the pursuit of a collaborative form  of what in Asian cultures is often described as the perfect harmony of  humankind and nature. The artist herself explains this eternal quest  as follows: “The desire to connect is omnipresent. It is about how we  can synergize with the world, live with nature and renew our energy.”“2017 was a spectacular year, a time when humanity embraced the  advent of artificial intelligence. During this time, I employed  augmented reality to create the 18th BMW Art Car, a car with an aura  of its own, enhanced by new technologies. 2021 was a difficult and  special year. While humanity was stuck and helpless, the world has  been moving determinedly into the metaverse, the age of virtual  immersion. This is the very moment when I was once again invited to  participate in BMW's groundbreaking Digital Art Mode,” said Cao Fei.  “My work ‘Quantum Garden’ gives the BMW driver the chance to  experience the ever-changing digital landscapes of a multifaceted  universe in a screen world, where abstract poetry and sensory pixels  intersect. Its network of open-ended spectra are connecting our hearts  to the call of goodwill from the depths of the universe.”In her own words, Cao Fei describes “Quantum Garden” as “a poetic  collection of universes, countless atoms, nebulae, and thousands of  fast-moving beams of light from the depths of the universe, and those  trailing strings of galaxies, growing larger and smaller, intersecting  and extending, combining and separating, perceiving and listening to  each other, around a myriad of constantly rotating centers. In a  multidimensional universe, the trajectory is non-linear, the journey  has no end, only the freedom to switch between the micro and macro  worlds, to wander, to explore, and to evolve.”New ways of experiencing culture: BMW Group once again  pioneeringThe Digital Art Mode was created in the  anniversary year of BMW Group Cultural Engagement. For 50 years, BMW  has been assuming its social responsibility in the world of culture  with its partnerships and initiatives. In doing so, hundreds of  long-term cooperations have become an integral part of the company’s  social sustainability. Many of its projects have begun exploring the  potential inherent in digitalization to expand the scope of BMW  Cultural Engagement, develop new forms of artistic expression and  reach new audiences.Digital art by Cao Fei: from the racetrack to the  BMW Curved DisplayWhen Cao Fei designed the BMW Art Car  in 2017, BMW Group once again pioneered the design of innovative  cultural experiences. For the very first time, a vehicle was  transformed into a rolling sculpture by using augmented reality. Cao  Fei’s BMW Art Car included three components: a film about a spiritual  time traveler, a carbon black BMW M6 GT3 and an augmented reality  installation consisting of multicolored light particles made visible  with the help of a custom-made app programmed for the occasion. Every  time the app was used near the race car, the screen of the smartphone  displayed floating, ever-changing light strips above and around the  BMW M6 GT3 – a reflection of the rapid change of the artist’s home  country as seen on the 18th BMW Art Car.Cao Fei sees her work on the new Digital Art Mode as a direct  continuation of her creative process in collaboration with the  BMW Group. Designing a race car with augmented reality will now be  followed by integrating digital art into the interior of series vehicles. If you have any questions, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsDoris FleischerBMW Group Cultural  EngagementTelephone: +49 89 328 27806Email: Doris.Fleischer@bmw.deMartin TholundBMW Group Digital Experience Communications  Telephone: +49 89 382 77126Email: martin.tholund@bmwgroup.comWebsite: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.de;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Magical exterior colour-change: The BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink.; World premiere: Body surface with real color change thanks to electrophoretic technology  Potential for future interior and exterior applications ;"Munich. Digitisation is delivering an integrated user  experience characterised by individuality and emotionalisation in the  interior of current BMW models. The My Modes allow the driver to  tailor the atmosphere in the interior entirely to their personal mood  and the driving experience they want. With the BMW iX Flow featuring E  Ink being presented on the occasion of CES 2022, the Munich-based  premium car manufacturer is offering the prospect of a future  technology that uses digitisation to also adapt the exterior of a  vehicle to different situations and individual wishes. The surface of  the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink can vary its shade at the driver's prompting.Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,    Development: ""Digital experiences won't just be  limited to displays in the future. There will be more and more melding  of the real and virtual. With the BMW iX Flow, we are bringing the car  body to life.""The fluid colour changes are made possible by a specially developed  body wrap that is tailored precisely to the contours of the  all-electric Sports Activity Vehicle from BMW. When stimulated by  electrical signals, the electrophoretic technology brings different  colour pigments to the surface, causing the body skin to take on the  desired colouration. Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design:  ""The BMW iX Flow is an advanced research and design project and a  great example of the forward thinking that BMW is known for.""The innovative E Ink technology opens completely new ways of changing  the vehicle's appearance in line with the driver's aesthetic  preferences, the environmental conditions or even functional  requirements. The technology thus offers unprecedented potential for  personalisation in the area of exterior design. The BMW iX Flow  featuring E Ink demonstrates this potential to impressive effect.  Against this background, the BMW Group is driving the development of  the technology so that a new form of personalisation can be  experienced both on the outside and in the inside of future production vehicles.Already today, the colour chosen for a car is an expression of the  driver's personality. The choice of exterior paints available for  current BMW models covers a wide colour spectrum. In this way, the  longing for a wildly expressive, extravagant, or sporty appearance on  the outside can be taken into account as well as the desire for an  understated, subtle or elegant appearance. New variants are added each  year that reflect the characteristics of the model in question and  that allow the brand to keep setting trends in the area of exterior design.New technologies will provide a whole new level of decision-making  freedom in the future. ""This gives the driver the freedom to  express different facets of their personality or even their enjoyment  of change outwardly, and to redefine this each time they sit into  their car,"" says Stella Clarke, Head of Project for the BMW iX  Flow featuring E Ink. ""Similar to fashion or the status ads on  social media channels, the vehicle then becomes an expression of  different moods and circumstances in daily life.""How a variable exterior colour can increase  efficiency.A variable exterior colour can also  contribute to wellness in the interior and to the efficiency of the  vehicle. This is done by taking account of the different abilities of  light and dark colours when it comes to reflecting sunlight and the  associated absorption of thermal energy. A white surface reflects a  lot more sunlight than a black one. By implication, heating of the  vehicle and passenger compartment as a result of strong sunlight and  high outside temperatures can be reduced by changing the exterior to a  light colour. In cooler weather, a dark outer skin will help the  vehicle to absorb noticeably more warmth from the sun.In both cases, selective colour changes can help to cut the amount of  cooling and heating required from the vehicle's air conditioning. This  reduces the amount of energy the vehicle electrical system needs and  with it also the vehicle's fuel or electricity consumption. In an  all-electric car, changing the colour in line with the weather can  therefore also help to increase the range. In the interior, the  technology could, for example, prevent the dashboard from heating up  too much.E Ink technology itself is extremely energy efficient. Unlike  displays or projectors, the electrophoretic technology needs  absolutely no energy to keep the chosen colour state constant. Current  only flows during the short colour changing phase.Millions of paint capsules in a custom wrap.  Electrophoretic colouring is based on a technology  developed by E Ink that is most well-known from the displays used in  eReaders. The surface coating of the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink  contains many millions of microcapsules, with a diameter equivalent to  the thickness of a human hair. Each of these microcapsules contains  negatively charged white pigments and positively charged black  pigments. Depending on the chosen setting, stimulation by means of an  electrical field causes either the white or the black pigments to  collect at the surface of the microcapsule, giving the car body the  desired shade.Achieving this effect on a vehicle body involves the application of  many precisely fitted ePaper segments. Generative design processes are  implemented to ensure the segments reflect the characteristic contours  of the vehicle and the resulting variations in light and shadow. The  generative design algorithms enable the necessary formability and  flexibility required to tailor the ePaper exactly to the design lines  of the vehicle.Laser cutting technologies guarantee high precision in generating  each segment. After the segments are applied and the power supply for  stimulating the electrical field is connected, the entire body is  warmed and sealed to guarantee optimum and uniform colour reproduction  during every colour change.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

New soundscapes for pure-electric driving pleasure: BMW IconicSounds Electric.;BMW presents drive system sounds from the collaboration with film score composer and Academy Award winner Hans Zimmer.  Individually configurable soundscapes are fundamental to a vehicle’s character and to creating an emotionally engaging driving experience.  Premiere in the BMW i4 and BMW iX.  Specific aural character for BMW M models. ;Munich. The spread of driving experiences offered by  the fully electric models from BMW ranges from hushed pleasure to  enthusiastic exploration of their dynamic limits. And now a  brand-typical drive sound fed into the interior of these models adds  even further depth to the pleasure of locally emission-free driving.  BMW IconicSounds Electric will bring new and emotionally rich  soundscapes into the brand’s model line-up. They have been created as  part of a collaboration between the BMW Group and Grammy and Academy  Award-winning film score composer Hans Zimmer. The new sounds reflect  the specific performance characteristics of the drive system on board  and the signature attributes of an electrified BMW in a completely new  yet wholly authentic way. “Sound is a fundamental part of the  emotional driving experience in a BMW,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Head  of BMW Group Design. “With the unparalleled experience and creativity  of Hans Zimmer to count on, we are creating a unique acoustic  character to our electric vehicles.” The BMW IconicSounds Electric  will be available for the first time in the BMW i4 in the first half  of 2022 and then also for the BMW iX in the second half of 2022. They  can be imported into suitably equipped vehicles via Remote Software Upgrade.The worlds of sound created by BMW IconicSounds Electric will vary  according to the driver’s My Modes selection. The Personal, Sport and  Efficient settings already available in current BMW models are now  being joined for the first time by the new My Modes Expressive and  Relax, with distinctive soundscapes to match. Electrified BMW M  models, meanwhile, come with BMW IconicSounds Electric variants  developed especially for them.Innovative sounds for electrified BMW  models.The acoustic perception of its vehicles has  always been high up the priority list for BMW. The company’s acoustic  engineers have been working on artificially generated sounds for  electric models since 2009 to ensure that pedestrians and cyclists are  alerted to approaching electric vehicles. In the BMW i8 launched in  2014, this pedestrian protection was joined by an artificially  generated sound inside the cabin. When the car was running in its  all-electric mode, this created an audible connection between the car  and its driver, who would have been more accustomed to the noise  produced by conventional drive systems. The electric drive sound of  the BMW i8 was inspired primarily by the functioning of its electric  motor. The journey to a whole new sound composition has since  progressed via the acoustic pedestrian protection system introduced in  2019 for the plug-in hybrid variants of the BMW 7 Series luxury sedan  all the way to the BMW IconicSounds Electric.BMW IconicSounds Electric started out as a collaboration between the  BMW Group and Grammy and Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer  with the objective of developing a revolutionary sound design and  concepts for the fleet of BMW electric vehicles and ultimately  creating the sounds of the future. This development results in the  practical and innovative use of sound for future production vehicles,  creating an emotional bond between driver and car. “We create sounds  which celebrate the beauty and complexity of our vehicles and which  move people,” says Renzo Vitale, Creative Director Sound der BMW Group.The partnership with Hans Zimmer.In Hans  Zimmer, the BMW Group has gained an experienced and  multi-award-winning partner whose many accolades now stretch back over  four decades. Zimmer’s passion for BMW cars started when he was very  young, as he recalls: “I’ve always been a BMW enthusiast. As a child,  I would recognise the sound of my mother’s BMW when she came home. I  am delighted to have the opportunity to design the sound of future  electric BMW models and create emotions for the electric driving  experience of tomorrow.” As a long-standing friend of the brand,  Zimmer felt a need to keep getting closely involved in the area of  sound design for BMW.Hans Zimmer has since contributed his expertise to sound design for  electrified BMW vehicles, both as composer and curator of BMW  IconicSounds Electric and through his work on various related  projects. In November 2019, Zimmer and Vitale jointly presented the  new start/stop sound for purely electrically powered and plug-in  hybrid models from BMW. At the start of every journey, this  ready-to-drive sound builds anticipation for the all-electric and  therefore locally emission-free driving experience to come.The BMW IconicSounds Electric project is based on a wide-ranging  international collaboration, with recordings taken from Zimmer’s  studios in Los Angeles and London, BMW’s sound lab in Munich and a  host of virtual sessions. “It is an honour to be able to work together  with BMW,” says Hans Zimmer. “This is a unique opportunity to not just  help design the sound of future electric vehicles, but also have an  impact on the soundtrack of tomorrow’s cities.” The composer was  clearly delighted to be part of the project, saying: “For the first  time since the industrial revolution, we have a unique opportunity to  redesign and redefine the sounds of our cities. And we are not  restricted in any way by mechanical limits.”Electric mobility spawns the reinvention of drive system  sounds.The progression into electric mobility has also  heralded a paradigm shift in terms of drive system acoustics. Unlike  conventionally powered vehicles, in which the combustion process in  the engine is accompanied by a sound, the drive systems of electric  vehicles work almost silently. Their understated aural output varies  very little from motor to motor.Consequently, the transformation from combustion engines to electric  mobility offers sound designers an extraordinary opportunity to  completely reinvent the acoustic perception of a vehicle. They can  create soundscapes which help make the sustainable mobility experience  even more intense, even more present and even more distinctive. BMW  IconicSounds Electric and the collaboration with Hans Zimmer utilise  this potential in a unique way.In its essence, the quietness of electric driving generates a whole  new level of comfort. However, the absence of sound also takes  something away from the driving experience. Acoustic feedback to  movements of the accelerator is a fundamental element in the emotional  experience on board a vehicle.And a vehicle’s acoustics also have a role to play in terms of  safety. That is why manufacturers have a legal obligation to equip  their electric vehicles with an Acoustic Vehicle Alert System. The  sound this emits in the area around the vehicle is designed to alert  pedestrians and cyclists to an electric vehicle approaching. The  audible pedestrian protection system fitted on electrified vehicles  from BMW generates a sound which has a powerful signalling effect but  does not detract from the acoustic comfort of those on board.The BMW IconicSounds Electric were developed with the driver’s  reaction to them in mind and also with just the right subtlety and  elegance to offer the driver an authentic and emotionally engaging  experience based on their relationship with their car and how they  interact with it. While developing the sounds that can be heard in the  cabin of electrified BMW models, care was taken to ensure that the  driver is guided by the soundtrack rather than being overwhelmed by it.The My Modes: sound as part of an all-encompassing user  experience.Within the aural spectrum defined for each  specific model, the drive sound emitted by the purely electric  vehicles from BMW varies depending on the selected My Mode. The My  Modes create an all-encompassing user experience in the cabin that is  geared towards the driver’s personal preferences. The interior  experience appeals to multiple senses at the same time, conjuring up  very special moments for the driver and their passengers to enjoy.  Activated using a button on the centre console, the My Modes combine  and orchestrate numerous vehicle functions, among them the drive soundtrack.With BMW IconicSounds Electric, the difference between the drive  sounds in the individual My Modes is even more clearly perceptible.  “Each My Mode places the emphasis on different facets of the car’s  character and this can also be heard in the sound it makes,” explains  Renzo Vitale. In the My Mode Personal – the default setting in the BMW  iX (the BMW i4 defaults to Comfort) – BMW IconicSounds Electric use a  spherical sound pattern and many tonal components to convey a basic  acoustic mood that voices the vehicle’s progressive and independent  character. At the same time, the transparent timbre captures the  design’s high-quality aesthetic appeal in acoustic form. The sound  variant heard in the cabin when Personal or Comfort mode is selected  also forms the basis for the drive sound transmitted externally by the  acoustic pedestrian warning system.The soundscapes devised for the My Modes are a composition of various  forms of sound generation, some of which are more traditional while  others are completely new creations. The foundation is provided by  human voices and classical instruments, but mechanical sounds and  unusual combinations are also used to produce various tones. Female  voices and the sound of a guitar string being made to vibrate using a  glass cylinder were just some of the elements incorporated into the  sound for the My Mode Comfort in the BMW i4, for instance, as Renzo  Vitale explains: “In this way, we transpose the characteristics of the  electric drive system into an individual and distinctively BMW soundscape.”The harmonious and elegant sound produced in the My Mode Personal or  Comfort contrasts with acoustic perception in the Sport setting, which  focuses far more strongly on the active driving experience. With a  distinct aural presence and extremely dynamic modulation, the  soundscape in this mode provides the driver with unequivocal acoustic  feedback on the motor’s power delivery and the current driving state.  The exhilarating experience of sporty driving is therefore enhanced by  the appropriate acoustic accompaniment.It is only in the My Mode Efficient that acoustic feedback is  suppressed altogether, with the drive system’s silent operation  seemingly proclaiming the driver’s decision to adopt an exceptionally  efficient driving style. The driver also has the option of  deactivating the drive sound in the other My Modes via the  corresponding iDrive menu.Two new My Modes with their own soundscapes.The  arrival of BMW IconicSounds Electric coincides with the presentation  of two further My Modes. The new Expressive and Relax settings also  encompass their own individual worlds of sound and they have a  particularly notable impact on the overall emotional experience during  the journey.The sound in the My Mode Expressive is accompanied by high-contrast  neon colours and abstract patterns on the BMW Curved Display. Its  underlying tonality consists of a violin tone. Another higher-pitched  sound structure is superimposed on top of this when accelerating,  altering the harmony in a number of stages as the vehicle’s speed  increases. The first full chord is heard when the vehicle reaches  60 km/h (37 mph), followed by a second complete chord at 120 km/h  (75 mph). When driving at a constant speed, on the other hand, the  pitch stays the same while the volume is dialled down significantly to  focus acoustic perception on the drive system’s hushed smoothness.This acoustic experience forms a stark contrast to the basic interior  mood produced by the soundtrack in the Relax My Mode, with the focus  switching to well-being, harmony and relaxation as soon as this  setting is selected. In keeping with the graphics that appear on the  BMW Curved Display – inspired by coastlines, rivers and lakes – this  produces a soft, subtle and harmonious composition of sounds that  lends itself to a calm and relaxed drive. “This soundscape relieves  any tension the driver is feeling and helps them to actively leave  stress behind them,” describes Renzo Vitale.Bespoke soundtracks for the BMW i4 and BMW  iX.The launch of BMW IconicSounds Electric means the  palette of sounds for purely electric BMW models that has been  developed in collaboration with Hans Zimmer can now be experienced in  full for the first time. The ready-to-drive sound, which is emitted  for about two seconds when the Start/Stop button is pressed, signals  that the sustainable mobility experience is about to commence. During  the journey, the driver’s inputs are accompanied by the drive sound  for the specific model. This encompasses not only acoustic feedback in  response to every movement of the accelerator, but also an authentic  backing track that clearly indicates the vehicle’s current operating state.In its role as the BMW Group’s new technology flagship the BMW iX  symbolises a remarkably progressive and also exceptionally comfortable  and spacious form of driving pleasure. The BMW i4, on the other hand,  brings all-electric mobility to the very heart of the brand. Its  positioning in the premium midsize segment means it is very closely  entwined with BMW tradition. In both cases, the vehicle  characteristics are reflected in the respective soundscapes.Electrically powered BMW M cars with a sound of their  own.A bespoke sound composition likewise accompanies  the driving experience in electrically powered BMW M models.  Consequently, the world of sound devised for the BMW i4 M50 (electric  power consumption combined as per WLTP: 22.5 – 18.0 kWh/100 km  [62 miles], CO2 emissions: 0 g/km) is bursting with energy.  “We are seeking to transfer the traditional elements of the BMW M  brand into the future,” comments Renzo Vitale.A powerful and imposing – yet never obtrusive – drive sound succeeds  in authentically conveying the hallmark agility, precision and poise  that characterises the handling of BMW M cars. The sound intensifies  sharply when accelerating, lending aural expression to the vehicle’s  powerful character. As a result, the stunning performance that is a  defining feature of the electrified models in the BMW M GmbH range can  be experienced with even greater intensity.The creative process of sound development.The  process of creating these innovative sounds starts with Hans Zimmer  and the BMW Group developing a shared understanding of the  technological and emotional goals for the new soundscapes. Zimmer and  Renzo Vitale then reimagine these emotions as melodic elements.  Together they consider what emotions could be aroused by each sound.  They often use traditional instruments but in a novel way, allowing  them to redefine the potential offered by certain musical resources.Once the newly designed sounds are ready, they are integrated into a  BMW by the sound design team and tested to obtain real-time feedback.  The finished soundtrack is road tested in the respective model so that  the emotions generated by the acoustic composition can be precisely  matched to the various My Modes and the driving situations.Although Zimmer and Vitale frequently use traditional instruments  when developing new sounds, they do so in an unconventional way,  creating sounds that would not normally be expected from these  instruments. The sound designers snap guitar strings instead of  strumming them, for example, or hurl objects against a wall and seek  inspiration in the unpredictable sound this makes. In another phase of  development, Hans Zimmer first creates a three-minute suite. He and  Vitale then proceed to extract elements from it in order to focus on  something entirely unexpected that provides the basis for a completely  new composition and way of expressing sound.Sound reinforces the relationship between driver and  car.Drivers don't identify with their BMW based purely  on the performance characteristics of its power unit and the driving  qualities – its soundtrack has always played a key role too. BMW  IconicSounds Electric now open up even greater scope for reinforcing  this emotional bond by turning it into a distinctive overall  experience. For the first time, the soundscapes devised for the purely  electrically powered models and their different variants depending on  the selected My Mode also take into account the driver’s personal  preferences and their basic mood in the situation at hand.This means the interaction between driver and vehicle can be  perceived in the cabin more intensely than ever. “Acoustic feedback  when accelerating has been fine-tuned to the changing pedal gradient,”  explains Renzo Vitale. Modulation of the sound is therefore matched to  the angle of the accelerator and, by extension, the driver’s inputs  with high precision. “When the driver interacts with the pedal, it’s  more than just a mechanical contact point – it’s a performative  element,” says Hans Zimmer. “Accelerating is turned into an experience  that takes the driver through a whole series of gradually changing  sound textures.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Powder snow and fairytale castles: with the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman through the winterly Allgäu.;All-wheel drive is an advantage in any traffic situation. But what four driven wheels are really capable of can only be experienced off the beaten track - and on snow. On an excursion with the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman, outstanding power and the ALL4 system provide ideal conditions for enjoying the white landscape in an extremely sporty way.;Munich. Snow is much more than a collection of frozen  water droplets. Its crystal lattice structure depends on the  temperature and humidity when the flakes form. At its best, snow is  loose, powdery and white. When it falls from the sky in the right  places, preferably mountainous ones, it forms the basis for attractive  leisure activities such as skiing, snowshoeing or sledding. Likewise,  the beautiful snow can provide an extra dose of skiing fun. The  prerequisite for this is some skill with the accelerator pedal,  steering wheel and brake, as well as the right vehicle.

She presented  the 10,000th MINI to its new owner, Andreas Hankel, at BMW Welt on 30  Dec. 2021, alongside Bernd Körber, head of MINI, Bernhard Kuhnt, head  of Market Germany and Erwin Winterholler, managing director of the  Widmann & Winterholler showroom.“We are proud of the tremendous success the fully-electric MINI has  already achieved since its market launch in March 2020,” von Mirbach  continued. “This success was only possible together with our strong  partners in the retail organisation.” Germany biggest market for MINI Electric Germany is the largest market worldwide for the fully-electric MINI  from Oxford. More than one in five MINIs (23.6%) is already fully  electric. The MINI Electric is the MINI family’s highest-volume  derivative and played a key role for the brand in 2021, delivering  growth of +132%. With the plug-in hybrid MINI Cooper SE Countryman  ALL4*, overall sales of electrified models increased by over 70%,  compared to the previous year. This means every third MINI (31%) is electrified. MINI sales in 2021 – growing market share A total of 43,004 MINI vehicles** were registered in Germany in 2021.  Von Mirbach explains: “In light of the challenging supply situation,  the fact that MINI sales were only 2.7% lower than the previous year  represents a strong operating performance by the whole team. As a  result, we were able to continue to grow MINI’s market share in the  premium segment.” MINI goes all-electricMINI has already paved the way for tomorrow’s electric future. The  fully-electric MINI Cooper SE is being built at Plant Oxford. The next  generation of the MINI Countryman will also come off the production  line in Leipzig as an electric model from 2023. In the same year,  production of fully-electric MINI models based on a new  electric-vehicle architecture will also begin in China.“In the same way that the first Mini brought a new dimension to the  mobility of the day just over 60 years ago, we are now taking the next  step, by going all-electric from the early 2030s onwards,” explains  von Mirbach. As an innovative and inspiring urban brand, MINI was made for  electromobility. MINI drivers appreciate the British brand’s  combination of signature go-kart feeling and individual design with  sustainable urban mobility. MINI has been the answer to the challenges  of individual mobility since it was born in the midst of the Suez  Crisis.

For many years, the BMW Group has been  presenting innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las  Vegas.

“Making charging even easier and more convenient”;Interview with the Members of the Board of Management of BMW AG Ilka Horstmeier, Human Resources, Labour Relations Director, Pieter Nota, Customer, Brands, Sales, and Dr Nicolas Peter, Finance;Munich. As an e-mobility pioneer, the BMW Group has  been closely involved with charging of electric vehicles and the  necessary infrastructure for more than a decade. The company takes a  holistic approach throughout the value chain that links together its  three main areas of focus. The aim is for charging to become even more  convenient than filling up the tank: available everywhere, easy to use  and with a high level of cost transparency.The path to e-mobility success leads through the charging station –  which is why charging infrastructure is a management priority for the  BMW Group. We talked to three Board of Management members, Ilka Horstmeier  (responsible for Human Resources and Labour Relations), Pieter Nota  (responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales) and Dr Nicolas Peter  (responsible for Finance), about how the BMW Group is approaching the  issue of charging, where the advantages and potential lie, and what  role charging should play in the continuing ramp-up of electromobility. Q:                        The BMW Group recently handed over    its one-millionth electrified vehicle to its new owner. One aspect    that is inextricably linked with the ramp-up of electromobility is    charging infrastructure. What is your opinion of this?Peter:                Right now, charging infrastructure is failing  to keep pace with sales of electrified vehicles. That is why we  urgently need rapid infrastructure expansion – especially in urban,  densely populated areas and over longer distances. This is also up to  policymakers: Economical operation must be ensured – and, if possible,  promoted – especially while infrastructure is still in the expansion  phase. Who’s going to build a second charging post if the first one  can’t cover its costs? But, in the long run, the market has to be able  to regulate itself in the interests of the customer. What we need for  this are clear objectives and incentive systems. The same applies to  fleet operators, to support their transition to electromobility.Q:                        Can this be achieved by building    infrastructure quickly? Or are there other obstacles? Horstmeier:    Focusing on rapid construction won’t be enough in some  areas. We will clearly need a lot of public charging points in the  near future to meet growing demand. But, above all else, customers  need easy access to as many charging points as possible – with  attractive terms and conditions across the board.Nota:                 Charging should be an enabler for  electromobility – and this is precisely where our BMW Charging and  MINI Charging services come in. Our customers can use a card or an app  to access more than 250,000 public charging points across Europe.Q:                        250,000 sounds like a lot of    charging points. But what about “range anxiety”? What percentage of    publicly accessible charging posts does your service even include? Nota:                 With BMW Charging and MINI Charging, we have a  network coverage of 90 percent* in Europe. In other words, you can use  nine out of ten publicly accessible charging points with our card. In  the top five electromobility markets, we are even up to 95 percent*.  This makes charging easy and convenient for our customers wherever  they go. There’s no “range anxiety” with us.Q:                        But there’s still the question of    price. Critics claim prices at the charging post vary greatly,    depending on the operator, and are not clearly posted for the    customer. Nota:                 We ensure full cost transparency: With our  award-winning Active Tariff, customers pay a basic monthly fee to  charge their vehicle at an attractive market-specific fixed rate. In  Germany, the basic monthly fee is five euros;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Group inspires talents for sustainable mobility;BMW Group successfully positions itself as one of the most exciting employers of our time in cross-industry competition  Recognised as “World's Most Attractive Employer” (automotive) and number one in the Young Professionals Barometer Germany. ;Munich. The BMW Group is shaping the mobility of  tomorrow – making it electric, digital and circular. With this  consistent focus, the company can offer exciting, future-oriented  jobs. The BMW Group was once again rewarded for this with the top spot  in relevant 2021 employer rankings and is therefore on a par with  international technology leaders. Young talents especially appreciate  that, at the BMW Group, they can contribute to society and grow as a  person. “We are especially pleased that we are able to position  ourselves as an attractive and reliable employer, at both national and  international level, in times of transformation. This also pays off in  the competition for young talents,” says Ilka Horstmeier, member of  the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Human Resources and  Labour Relations.In this year’s “World’s Most Attractive Employer” survey of around  221,000 students from the ten most important economic nations  conducted by Universum, the BMW Group was ranked as the best  automotive employer worldwide among all target groups. The company is  holding its own in a highly competitive international market for the  best talents. In the engineering category, the BMW Group took one of  the top spots – earning a sensational third place, right behind Google  and Microsoft. In the survey of IT students, the BMW Group was the  only industrial company among the tech giants and the only automotive  company to make the top ten, with a solid ninth place. The BMW Group  also finished well ahead of all other automotive manufacturers in the  business students’ ranking, coming in 13th. The BMW Group consistently  makes the top ten in the IT category in other relevant surveys of  students and professionals in Germany, like the Trendence Graduate  Barometer and the Universum Students and Professionals Study. In the  engineering and business categories, the company comfortably ranks  among the top five employers.It is particularly gratifying that the BMW Group was also named most  attractive employer by young professionals in Germany in the Trendence  Professionals Barometer for the tenth consecutive year. Trendence  Institut GmbH is an independent consulting and market research firm  that surveys more than 25,000 experienced college graduates every  year. The BMW Group is also a very popular employer among skilled  workers: In the Trendence Skilled Workers Barometer 2021, which  surveyed almost 50,000 employees in Germany, the company was ranked  second and therefore improved on its position from the previous year.  In the survey of students on their assessment of the attractivity of  employers, the BMW Group has again ranked 4th and is thus an  established entity in the Trendence Student Barometer. This shows that  talents in the marketplace also recognise what BMW Group staff confirm  in the company’s own Employee Surveys: This year, 91 percent of them  said they were proud to work for the BMW Group.Young talents seeking security and stabilityCOVID-19, but also the economic and social upheavals of 2020 and  2021, have led young talents to re-evaluate their working life. The  studies are seeing a shift in young talents towards more stability and  security – and, therefore, more towards companies like the BMW Group  that have already successfully steered their employees through times  of change in the past.Talents for a forward-looking digital and sustainable mobilityThe BMW Group offers a whole host of attractive perspectives. Above  all, this includes fascinating products that are not just developed  virtually, but implemented and visible on the roads. This is  particularly appealing to IT talents, whose innovations are crucial to  the mobility of tomorrow. “Both young talents and professionals in the  fields of IT, science and engineering can find highly attractive entry  opportunities at the BMW Group. New colleagues quickly gain an insight  into our topics, interfaces, and products, and become part of the BMW  Group’s creative and dynamic global team. We provide the best  conditions for our teams to leverage their individual skills and  passion to shape the best solutions for the sustainable mobility of  the future,” says Nicole Kurek, head of Talent and Transformation  Management. To achieve this, the BMW Group is also looking for experts  in future areas of activity like battery research, automated driving,  artificial intelligence, software development and IT security, but  also IT specialists for databases and cloud systems, as well as app  developers for infotainment and entertainment.Interested talents can discover for themselves what working at the  BMW Group is all about on the BMW Group Careers social media channels.  They can also find information on openings for direct entry and  internships, and apply directly, on the BMW Group career pages.Further information: If you have any questions, please contact:BMW Group Corporate CommunicationsAngela Konert, spokesperson Human ResourcesTelephone: +49-89-382-50591Email: angela.konert@bmw.deBernd Eckstein, head of Communications Human Resources, Working  Environment, Real Estate, Corporate CitizenshipTelephone: +49-89-382-59490Email: bernd.eckstein@bmw.deMedia website: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail: presse@bmw.de The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Back home: BMW Group Ambassador Alessandro Zanardi continues his recovery process at home.;A little more than one and a half years have passed since Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) was seriously injured in a handbike accident in June 2020 in Italy. In his long recovery process, the BMW Group Ambassador shows his well-known fighting spirit. The 55-year old has meanwhile left hospital and continues his rehabilitation partly at home. In an interview, his wife Daniela Zanardi speaks about the current situation.;Munich. A little more than one and a half years have passed    since Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) was seriously injured in a handbike    accident in June 2020 in Italy. In his long recovery process, the    BMW Group Ambassador shows his well-known fighting spirit. The    55-year old has meanwhile left hospital and continues his    rehabilitation partly at home. In an interview, his wife Daniela    Zanardi speaks about the current situation. Five months after her first interview in July 2021, Daniela Zanardi again would like    to use this opportunity to address the public and answer questions    about the status of Alex’ recovery. Daniela, the sympathy you receive from all over the world is    certainly still very high? Daniela Zanardi: “Yes, we still get a lot of messages and especially  on Alex’s 55th birthday in October it was overwhelming how  many people have sent him their best wishes, also via social media. We  are very grateful to see how many people all over the world have Alex  in their thoughts. This great sympathy shows how much Alex’s recovery  touches the people. For this reason, we have decided to offer the  public an insight into his current recovery process for the second  time with this interview. At the same time, we appreciate everybody’s  understanding that, apart from this, we cannot respond to the many  requests about this health and we also ask everybody to respect our  privacy. Because our highest priority is to accompany Alex on his way  with our full energy.” What can you say about the recovery process? How is Alex these days? Zanardi: “The recovery continues to be a long process. The  rehabilitation programme led by doctors, physiotherapists,  neuropsychologists and speech therapists has enabled steady progress.  Of course, setbacks are there and can still occur. Sometimes you also  have to make two steps back in order to make one step forward. But  Alex proves again and again that he is a real fighter.” … who has reached an important milestone! Zanardi: “Yes, indeed. An important step was that Alex was able to  leave hospital a few weeks ago and is back at home with us now. We had  to wait very long for this and are very happy that it was possible  now, even if there are still temporary stays in special clinics  planned for the future to carry out special rehabilitation measures on site.” How did Alex settle at home? Zanardi: “Very well. After the long time in hospital it is important  for him to be back with his family and in his familiar environment.  You also have to consider that, due to the Corona situation, Alex had  only people with face masks and in protective equipment around him for  one and a half years. In addition, due to the comprehensive and  important protective measures in the clinic, the visiting  possibilities are, of course, very restricted.” What does that mean exactly? Zanardi: “Alex hasn’t met friends and part of the family for one and  a half years. Only me, our son and Alex’s mother could visit him, but  always only one person per day and this only for one and a half hours.  All this did not help to make the situation easier for Alex. Therefore  it helps that he is now at home with us, even if also at home he  currently can only be with the closest family as Corona numbers are  increasing again. But we are with Alex all day, he is in his familiar  environment and thus could return a little bit to normality. This  gives him additional power. We are very grateful to the medical staff  in the clinics he has been treated in. The doctors, care personnel,  therapists and everybody being involved have done so much for Alex and  continue to accompany us in his recovery process. In the clinics, Alex  is in very good hands, but his own home still is his own home.” What can you tell us about his daily programme and routine? Zanardi: “It varies. Different programmes Alex did in hospital, are  continued at home now. During the week, a therapist works with him and  they do physical, neurological and logopedical exercises. In regards  of his physical condition, there is a lot of progress. Alex has more  and more strength in the arms, that has increased a lot. And, other  than in hospital where he was in bed a lot, Alex now spends most of  the day in the wheel chair with us. He just rests a bit in the  afternoon after lunch.” What are the further expectations for his recovery process? Zanardi: “You still can’t predict how his recovery will further  develop. It is still a long and challenging way that Alex tackles with  a lot of fighting spirit. It is a big help for him and us that we  receive so much support on this way, not only from the doctors and  therapists that intensively work with him. Our friends are always  there for us. This includes the BMW Group family which we can always  count on and that is firmly at our side also in this difficult time.  We are very grateful to everyone for that and for so much more because  these strong ties give us additional energy. This also goes for the  continued sympathy we receive from racing drivers, fans and  acquaintances from all over the world. We would like to express a big  Grazie to all who send their good thoughts and power to Alex. We wish  everybody a merry Christmas and all the best for the new year.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The BMW Christmas film featuring star cast: Christoph Waltz on the run from Christmas encounters Oliver Zipse and the BMW iX.; BMW Group and Academy Award winner continue their successful cooperation  In the clip, Waltz tries to escape the Christmas kitsch and encounters the Chairman of the Board of the BMW Group  Supercar Blondie and Alexa Chung are along for the ride, too: Happy ending with a red BMW iX  ;Munich. They did it again. After Academy Award winner  Christoph Waltz played a central role in the world design premiere of  the BMW iX at #NEXTGen 2020, he now stars in the new BMW Christmas  film. In the film he encounters two old acquaintances: Oliver Zipse,  Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, and the BMW iX. They  are supported by Alex Hirschi, known as Supercar Blondie, star  designer Alexa Chung and Kai Langer, Head of Design BMW i who also  appear in the clip.Christoph Waltz's partnership with the BMW Group was initiated by  Oliver Zipse. The company cooperates with avant-garde pioneers from  ecology, social sciences, fashion, sports, music, film and other  cultural disciplines. The goal is to create a deeper understanding of  the needs, desires and trends of the future. Zipse invited the actor  to enter into critical dialogue with designers, technology developers  and strategy experts from the BMW Group. His openness, pragmatism and  his slight impatience have given the BMW Group important impetus. Now  this cooperation continues.The result is a clip of cinematic quality, a cat-and-mouse game  embedded in a wonderful Christmas film setting. It’s exciting and  thrilling and there’s a fine sense of irony and comedy. The BMW  Christmas film begins in Munich. It’s late afternoon at BMW  headquarters, a classic BMW 3.0 CS approaches. The driver gets out and  we see who it is: Christoph Waltz.He is on his way to a meeting with Oliver Zipse and to the BMW iX,  the BMW Group's new technology flagship that represents the future of  the company: Fully electric, sustainable, featuring pioneering design  and luxurious interior comfort. These things are important to  Christoph Waltz. The actor is intensively involved with the ecological  aspects of sustainable drive technology. He values premium quality,  technological precision and attention to detail. He doesn't make much  of Christmas.On the run from ChristmasThere is a mix-up at the reception. After Waltz has registered his  meeting with Oliver Zipse, he is told he is invited to the BMW  Christmas party. A staff member in a Christmas hat is to take him  there. Waltz freezes. It is the prelude to an amusing escape in which  Christoph Waltz is only concerned with one thing: To avoid everything  that has to do with Christmas. Which doesn’t turn out to be so easy.Christoph Waltz hopes for support from two celebrity guestsWaltz is making his way through BMW Welt, when he hears voices. Two  more celebrity guests appear in the Christmas film: Kai Langer, Head  of Design BMW i, and fashion designer Alexa Chung. The joy of seeing  them quickly when he finds out that these two are also on their way to  the BMW Christmas party.While searching for a way out, the actor meets another familiar face.  Alex Hirschi aka Supercar Blondie stands next to a concealed BMW  model. She is just about to unveil the vehicle when Waltz bursts onto  the set. Supercar Blondie complains loudly, but by then Waltz has  already disappeared from the scene.Christoph Waltz runs off, he rushes into another room thinking he is  finally safe. He spins around - and finds himself standing in the  middle of the BMW Christmas party. Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board  of Management of BMW AG, approaches him, they clink glasses. The actor relaxes.Happy ending with an Aventurine Red BMW iXThe BMW Christmas film wouldn't be a real Christmas film without a  happy ending. How the story ends is revealed at the end of the clip.  All we’ll give away is: It's also about an Aventurine Red BMW iX that  leaves nothing to be desired. Especially at Christmas. Watch the entire BMW Christmas film here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Motorrad Motorsport attends first winter test in southern Spain in preparation for the 2022 WorldSBK season.;In preparation for the 2022 season of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad Motorsport carried out its first winter test. The two BMW teams – BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Bonovo action BMW Racing Team – took to the track in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, this week.;Jerez de la Frontera. In preparation for the 2022 season of    the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad    Motorsport carried out its first winter test. The two BMW teams –    BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Bonovo action BMW Racing Team – took    to the track in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, this week.  In the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Michael van der Mark (NED)  continued his work on the BMW M 1000 RR as he looks to take another  step forward next season after one win and a further two podiums in  2021. Scott Redding (GBR) used the test days to familiarise himself  with his future bike and team. The Brit had gained his first  experience on his new bike during a private test in Estoril (POR) last  week. The focus there was on getting to know the bike and recording  the ergometry. The findings from the test were implemented quickly and  the modified parts and new components were already available by the  time he arrived at the Jerez de la Frontera test. With the two riders, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team tested engine  specifications for 2022, as well as chassis modifications. The direct  competitive comparison allows the team to determine the work direction  in preparation for the next test in the new year. The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team is also at Jerez de la Frontera  with its two new riders. After Eugene Laverty (IRL) and Loris Baz  (FRA) visited the team headquarters in Germany in November, they began  the test work together at the racetrack. Laverty, who was heavily  involved in the development of the BMW M 1000 RR, will be racing with  the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in his third season as a BMW works  driver. Baz is already familiar with the BMW S 1000 RR, on which he  rode in the WorldSBK in 2018, and uses the test to learn more about  the M RR. Quotes after the Jerez de la Frontera test. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “There have been a lot of new things at this test. In general, it has  been important to test with all four riders, including the two new  additions Baz and Redding, before Christmas. It was good to have all  four riders on the same bike on the same race track. We brought a lot  of new test items that we either confirmed or evaluated with all four  of the in order to get the right direction. With two new riders you of  course first to get used to the way they give their feedback and how  to transfer their comments but we managed that very well. We then also  compared this feedback with that given by van der Mark and Laverty who  already knew the bike very well. We have ticked all boxes in our test  programme but maybe might do some further laps tomorrow. We gathered a  huge amount of information and this is now to be analysed. Overall, we  found very good directions and in general, I am very satisfied. We  take a lot of positives back home. Now we will have a well-deserved  Christmas break but then we will continue to intensively prepare for  the season. We are very optimistic looking forward.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It has been a successful test for both sides of the pit box.  We have a new rider with Scott. He had a lot of things to work through  but most importantly for him was to find that comfortable setting  feeling with the bike. I am really pleased about his work ethic in the  pit box. He has put a lot of laps in and he acclimatised very well. On  Michael’s side, we worked on similar development parts to what Scott  has and he has been working through that very well as well. Comparing  both riders’ feedback it is very similar and  I am very pleased about  that. I think it is proving that the set-up direction we are going  with the BMW M 1000 RR is aligned between both riders which is very  important. Equally important is that we got new team-members within  the group and I am really pleased to see how all these guys are  working together. There has been a lot of overlapping, a lot of  chassis changes, a lot of engine changes and everybody has been  working as a group, so I applaud all the team and all the guys working  very closely together. Overall I think we can leave the test here at  Jerez with our heads held up high, we have done a good job and we can  go into the Christmas break with a lot of confidence and get ready for  our next test in the new year.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was good to have a test even if it was so late in the year. We had a  lot of new components and items to try on the bike. At this test we  barely played around with the set-up of the bike, we mainly tried new  parts to figure out what brings improvement and what does not. We need  to get some ideas and start producing the new things. It has been a  really good test and I am really happy with a lot of new things. It  was great to gather good information and now I am looking forward to a  short Christmas break.” Michael Galinski, Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team:  “It has been the first test for the new season and the first  time for us to be at the race track with the big team. I want to take  this opportunity to say a big thank you to Jürgen Röder, who made it  possible for us to now compete as a two-rider team. He will attend  many races next year and we are looking forward to that. We have a lot  of new people with us, also the riders are partly new for us. Of  course we have known both for many years. Loris has already raced for  our team and I have also known Eugene for quite some time. Both did a  great job at the test. But not only that, it was also important for me  to gel with the new members as a team and to get used to each other.  That worked very well. With new people, for example from England and  France, our team has become more international after being a more or  less German squad in the past. Like at every other team, English is  now our team language. The collaboration in the combination with SMR  and Bonovo action also works very well. There are always a lot of  things to try and when time allows we share this between us. The test  has been very positive in all aspects, we are also happy with the lap  times. But we still have some things to find and work to do.” Eugene Laverty, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I  already met the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in November when we went  to Germany and spent a weekend together with the guys. They invited us  all there and it was so nice to meet each other away from the track  because sometimes you only meet the guys in a work environment. So to  go there, have some beers and relax away from the track and made me  feel at home straight away. The first test days with the team have  been very positive. I felt comfortable on the bike immediately after  the first couple of exits on day one. I feel good in braking which is  an area I am always working on. I am happy with the progress we are  making. There is still work to do to improve our turning in the long  corners compared to the other BMW riders but I am happy that we are  right there in the mix. There is a really good atmosphere in the box,  I get on very well with Loris. He is a fast guy and that’s important,  to have a fast team-mate to push you. We work together well and all  the guys are experienced as well. It’s great crew and I think we have  a good year ahead of us.” Loris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I am happy  to be back with BMW and about the opportunity to be back in WorldSBK.  I was really looking forward to that test to have a first impression.  A December test is never the most crucial one of the season but it’s  really important for getting to know the team, to meet the people and  for the feeling you are going into the winter with. The test was a lot  of work, we did a lot of laps. Also, I was back on the bike after  nearly three months and it is never easy when you jump on a bike that  is completely different. The test was about understanding how the bike  works and also to try to give the best input based on the differences  of all the bikes I know. I have riden a lot of bikes in WorldSBK so I  was trying to adapt to the bike and at the same time give the right  input on what we can improve on that bike. The M RR has a lot of  strong points, we just need to put them together to get a bike that  works well from a riding side. When you start working with a new bike,  you have to switch from one riding style to another but we did a good  job, completing over 150 laps. Yes, I am happy. We tried some new  parts for next year and mainly a lot of things on the electronics, and  with every run we went faster and I felt a bit more confident on the  bike. I am satisfied with the job so far.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A joint future: Partnership between BMW and shooting star Matti Schmid.;Germany's Matti Schmid was presented with his new BMW X3 xDrive30e* at BMW Welt today. For the shooting star, who won the silver medal for best amateur at this year’s Open Championship, this marks the beginning of a partnership with BMW.;Matti Schmid was presented with his new BMW X3 xDrive30e* at BMW Welt today. For the shooting star, who    won the silver medal for best amateur at this year’s Open    Championship, this marks the beginning of a partnership with BMW.“We extend a warm welcome to Matti Schmid as he joins the BMW  Golfsport family and are really looking forward to working together,”  said Christian Masanz, Head of Sports Marketing BMW Germany. “Matti  has proven his huge potential time and again. He is as ambitious as he  is likeable, and BMW is delighted and confident to be partnering with  him as he advances his sporting career.”Matti Schmid said: “I have an eventful, important and successful year  behind me. But that was just the beginning, I still have a lot of  goals that I want to achieve. I’m really looking forward to having BMW  at my side as I start working towards them – and I’m delighted to be  driving a BMW X3. BMW is one of the most renowned partners in  international golf, I am proud of this collaboration.”This season saw the 24-year-old achieve important milestones in his  golfing career that is in its early days. At the BMW International  Open in Munich, he finished in a superb tied 14th place,  making him the highest ranked amateur. And Schmid was the best amateur  in the field once again at the Open at Royal St George’s Golf Club,  finishing tied with Ryder Cup players Lee Westwood (ENG) and Bernd  Wiesberger (AUT), among other players.Schmid became a pro right after winning the Silver Medal. In just  seven starts on the European Tour he managed to earn the right to play  in the 2021/22 season of the series currently in progress, which has  since been renamed DP World Tour. Schmid only just missed out on  getting his first win on the European Tour in September, when he  finished three shots behind winner Kristoffer Broberg (SWE) to take  second place at the Dutch Open.In recognition of his outstanding achievements, Schmid was presented  with the DP World Tour “Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year Award”  last week. The award for best rookie of the season has only been won  by one other German golfer: Martin Kaymer in 2007, who went on to  become number one in the world rankings, two-time major winner and  three-time Ryder Cup winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
At the end of an exciting season: Ben Young wins the 2021 BMW Motorrad Race Trophy.;Ben Young is the winner of the 2021 BMW Motorrad Race Trophy. Born in Scotland but now living in Canada, he scored more Race Trophy points in his races in the Canadian Superbike Championship (CSBK) than any other competitor. Young was rewarded for his success with a spectacular main prize, a new BMW M 1000 RR. Young received his new bike at BMW Motorrad Canada in Toronto (CAN). ;München. Ben Young is the winner of the 2021 BMW Motorrad Race    Trophy. Born in Scotland but now living in Canada, he scored more    Race Trophy points in his races in the Canadian Superbike    Championship (CSBK) than any other competitor. Young was rewarded    for his success with a spectacular main prize, a new BMW M 1000 RR.    Young received his new bike at BMW Motorrad Canada in Toronto (CAN).  Since 2014, BMW Motorrad Motorsport has brought private  BMW racers from different international and national championships  around the world under one roof in a unique competition – the Race  Trophy. In 2021, a new scoring system was introduced with the ‘winning  percentage’. The Race Trophy points correspond to the percentage of  the points that the competitors have scored in their respective  championship in relation to the maximum number of points possible in  the racing series. Young emerged triumphant from a close  battle to win the 2021 Race Trophy. He finished on the podium in all  seven races of the 2021 CSBK season – one victory, five second-places  and one third – and scored a total of 84.86 Race Trophy points. In  doing so, Young narrowly defeated Roberto Tamburini (ITA) from the  Italian National Trophy 1000, who ended the year on 84.00 points.  Third place went to Alexandre Leleu (FRA) from the French European  Bikes Championship with 76.86 points. “Congratulations to  Ben Young, on behalf of the entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport family,”  said BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “It has been  another very exciting season, in which our private racers around the  world have again achieved countless successes. As such, the ‘winning  percentages’ they achieved in their respective racing series are very  high. All the top riders won races and claimed podiums in their  championships on the BMW M 1000 RR and the BMW S 1000 RR, so the race  for the Race Trophy was a very close one. We are also very proud to  have a number of champions in our ranks again this season. I would  like to congratulate all our motor racing customers on the success  they have achieved this season. They are the best ambassadors we at  BMW Motorrad Motorsport could wish for.” “Congratulations  to Ben Young and all the participants on their success in the 2021  season,” said Uwe Geyer, who is responsible for the Race Trophy at BMW  Motorrad Motorsport. “We are delighted that private BMW racers remain  keen to be a part of the Race Trophy family – although the pandemic  continues to affect the sport of motor racing. In 2021, our  participants came from 21 countries in Europe, America, Asia and  Oceania. That shows how close-knit our global family of racers is. We  are grateful to all the racers and teams for being part of the BMW  Motorrad Racing community.” A BMW M 1000 RR for winner Ben Young.Unfortunately, the pandemic meant it was not possible to stage a  grand finale to assemble and honour the top riders in 2021. Instead,  Young received his main prize – the BMW M 1000 RR – at BMW Motorrad  Canada. “Achieving this is very important to myself and my  team,” said winner Young. “After a Covid affected 2020 it is very  satisfying to come back racing and reach these goals I set for myself.   I feel like this is a great opportunity for myself and Canadian  racing to be recognized on a worldwide stage, and I am proud to be  able to do that. It was a great season of racing. It was nice to be  back after a year out. Working for the first time with the new  generation BMW S 1000 RR was amazing right from the get go, gaining  knowledge every lap we turned along the way. We do plan on racing the  BMW M 1000 RR next year which for me is like a dream come true. Ever  since the bike was released, it was something to drool over and now  being able to race it is going to be spectacular!” Victories and podiums aplenty.Second-placed Tamburini ended the year just 0.86 points behind  Young. Tamburini also finished on the podium in all seven races in the  Italian National Trophy 1000. With three victories, two second-places  and a third, he was crowned champion with races to spare. This was the  first title for the new BMW M 1000 RR. Third-placed Leleu was the man  to beat in the French European Bikes Championship. In 14 races, he  took eight victories on the BMW S 1000 RR, as well as one runner-up  finish and two third-places. He also won the title in his  series. Tamburini and Leleu, like all the riders who  finished from second to tenth place, receive vouchers for BMW Motorrad  parts packages, which can be redeemed at BMW Motorrad Motorsport  Official Partner, alpha Racing. The total value of the vouchers  amounts to € 40,000 (see below for an overview of the top ten). 2021 champions.In its debut season the new BMW M 1000 RR enjoyed titles and  success from the word go in various championships around the world –  and did so in a manner worthy of champions. Tamburini claimed the  first title for the new Superbike at the end of April, when he was  crowned champion in the Italian National Trophy 1000 after six of the  season’s seven races. The maiden title in an international  championship came courtesy of Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) in the  Internationalen German Motorcycle Championship (IDM). Mikhalchik had  previously been champion twice with the S 1000 RR, and repeated that  success on the M 1000 RR. The podium in the 2021 IDM was an all-BMW  affair. Champion Mikhalchik was joined on the rostrum by two fellow  BMW riders Florian Alt (GER) and Luca Grünwald (GER). In the Spanish  Superbike Championship, Ivo Lopes (POR) won the title with the BMW M  1000 RR. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese rider to be  crowned champion in the Spanish Superbike series. Other  BMW riders also won titles in their series on the BMW S 1000 RR. The  experienced Didier Grams (GER) again ended an exciting season as  champion of the International Road Racing Championship. In the French  European Bikes Championship, first and second place went to BMW  riders;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW M Motorsport says thank you to Martin Tomczyk for ten amazing years together.;After ten years together, BMW M Motorsport and Martin Tomczyk (GER) are heading in different directions at the end of the season. The current BMW M works driver will be taking on new challenges next year. ;Munich. After ten years together, BMW M Motorsport and Martin    Tomczyk (GER) are heading in different directions at the end of the    season. The current BMW M works driver will be taking on new    challenges next year. He joined BMW M Motorsport as reigning DTM    champion in late 2011, played a leading role in BMW’s DTM comeback    in 2012, and went on to become an influential character and a    brilliant representative of the BMW brand in the years that followed. “Martin Tomczyk was a terrific ambassador for BMW M Motorsport on and  off the racetrack, and for that I would like to extend my heartfelt  thanks to him,” said Mike Krack, head of BMW M Motorsport. “Be it in  the DTM, endurance racing, the IMSA series or FIA WEC, Martin  represented BMW M Motorsport in the highest categories and grew to  become one of the faces of the brand. Although we are heading in  different directions now, we all enjoy looking back on our time  together. I wish him all the best for the future!” Tomczyk said: “It goes without saying that it is a shame that my time  with BMW M Motorsport is coming to an end after ten years. As a  Bavarian, driving for a Bavarian manufacturer has always been a real  honour. I had a great time, I drove fantastic race cars in some of the  biggest races in the world and celebrated a few successes. Many thanks  to everyone who joined me on this journey! Now I’m looking forward to  a new challenge.” BMW M Motorsport and Tomczyk started their journey together at the  end of 2011 when he joined as the newly crowned DTM champion to take  on a leading role in the brand’s DTM comeback the following year. At  the wheel of the BMW M3 DTM he finished on the podium three times and  finished eighth in the driver standings in 2012. He represented BMW M  Motorsport in the touring car series until 2016. After a season in the  IMSA series, Tomczyk contested the FIA WEC and the 24 Hours of Le Mans  (FRA) in a BMW M8 GTE in 2018 and 2019. He celebrated his biggest  successes at the wheel of the BMW M6 GT3 at the endurance classic at  the Nürburgring (GER), where he finished on the podium in third place  in 2020 and in second place in 2021.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"From MINI with BIG LOVE: ""Driving Home for Christmas"" video clip featuring the worldwide MINI community.";MINI fans from around the world join in the festive music video, 43 years after the song was written in a classic Mini. ;"The video clip can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2we7JdB7iYMunich.

The MINI Electric alone in New York.;"Countless colourful lights, a sparkling atmosphere, imaginative decorations in the department stores and creatively decorated residential districts make a pre-Christmas visit to the ""Big Apple"" an unforgettable experience. The tour through the illuminated canyons of the city in the all-electric MINI Cooper SE is particularly festive when, with a bit of luck, its already quiet ride is also dampened by snow. ";"Munich. Everyone who visits New York City for the  first time has one big problem: Where to start in the metropolis of  eight million? The city covers more than 1 200 square kilometres, is  one of the most important trading centres in the world and offers a  colourful selection of around 500 galleries, more than 200 museums,  about 150 theatres as well as no less than 18 000 restaurants. The  answer is easier if you choose to visit during the Christmas season:  Manhattan. Because probably nowhere else in the world is the time  before the holidays celebrated as much as there, where millions of  lights enchant the city already at the beginning of December. The more  than luxuriant sea of lights is a tradition, just like the streets  packed with street cruisers, yellow taxis, stretch limousines and  pick-ups. The sightseeing tour in the all-electric MINI Cooper SE  (power consumption combined: 17.6 - 15.2 kWh/100 km according to WLTP,  16.9 - 14.9 kWh/100 km according to NEDC, CO2 emissions combined: 0  g/km) creates a relaxing contrast. Virtually silent and locally  emission-free, the MINI Electric offers a glimpse of the urban  mobility of the future all on its own in New York.Even in Manhattan, the MINI Cooper SE moves cleverly between sporty  temperament and stylish restraint. Its 135 kW/184 hp electric motor  accelerates it to 60 km/h in just 3.9 seconds at traffic lights.  Sustained driving pleasure is thus guaranteed. And wherever things are  a little quieter, pedestrians and cyclists are alerted to its approach  by a drive sound specially developed for the MINI Electric and  broadcast via exterior loudspeakers at low speed.An ideal starting point for the somewhat different city tour is  Central Park - and there the famous ice rink in the southern part of  the green space. Wollman Rink has been the backdrop for many Hollywood  films such as Love Story and is as popular with New Yorkers as it is  with tourists. It is an experience to be on the ice amidst the  skyscrapers with a view of the Christmas skyline of Manhattan and then  to explore the wintry park on foot.A visit to New York in December naturally includes extensive  Christmas shopping. The city is decorated everywhere, the shop windows  glitter, tell stories and make the eyes light up. The Macy's  department stores' (151 West 34th Street) is particularly splendid.  There, not only the beautifully decorated shop windows, but above all  Santa Claus himself awaits visitors young and old. In the famous Santa  Land on Macy's eighth floor, everyone can make their Christmas wishes.Via the famous 5th Avenue and West 59th Street, we then go directly  to Columbus Circle. The Christmas market there is one of the most  atmospheric in New York. The shops in the southwest corner of the park  are colourfully lit. Twelve stars more than four metres high hang from  the 30-metre-high ceiling of the Time Warner Center. The light show  ""Under the Stars"" is a real New York tradition. The  Christmas market on Union Square, on the other hand, is almost  European, where numerous New York artists and craftsmen show their  talent and creativity amidst stalls with food, drinks and sweets.On the way to more shopping hotspots, the MINI Electric rolls along  The Plaza at the intersection of 5th Avenue and East 59th Street. The  hotel with the imposing French-style façade has served as a hostel for  wealthy and famous guests for more than 100 years. Nearly 30 years  ago, it was one of the locations of the successful cinema comedy  ""Kevin - Alone in New York"". Donald Trump, then owner of The  Plaza, plays a small supporting role in it. Whether you're a parent, grandparent or godmother, if you have a wish  list written by a child in your pocket on your New York tour, you'll  inevitably be drawn to the FAO Schwarz toy shop. Once the largest toy  shop in the world, it was located on 5th Avenue until 2015 and  reopened in Rockefeller Plaza in 2018. Much of the old charm remains,  including the ""Big Piano"" on the floor, made famous by Tom  Hanks' dance in the film ""Big"". The assortment is huge, and  some people buy more than will eventually fit under the Christmas  tree. There is plenty of room for this in the luggage compartment of  the MINI Cooper SE. It can be expanded from 211 to 731 litres. Thanks  to the high-voltage battery located deep in the vehicle floor, the  MINI Electric offers exactly the same stowage volume as the  conventionally powered MINI 3-door.Close to the New York's Toy Paradise, at 1260 6th Avenue, there is  Radio City Music Hall. This is where the world-famous Radio City  Christmas Spectacular is performed, one of the most iconic Christmas  shows in New York. It includes everything that belongs to the great  celebration: from Father Christmas to the Nutcracker to the birth of  Christ. And right next door at Rockefeller Center is probably the most  famous Christmas tree in the world. This year it is a 25-metre tall  spruce from the state of Maryland. On its top sits a large star,  designed by star designer Daniel Libeskind. More than 50,000 coloured  lights illuminate the tree.At this sight, hardly anyone might think of the associated  electricity bill. But after all, not everything that is fun can be as  efficient as a MINI Electric. Its motor works very frugally, and in  addition, electricity can be fed back into the high-voltage battery  again and again during the drive in push and braking phases. The  driver can individually determine the intensity of the braking energy  recuperation via a toggle switch. The higher of the two recuperation  modes ensures a particularly strong expression of the characteristic  one-pedal feeling. When the accelerator pedal is released, electricity  is fed back into the high-voltage battery and the vehicle is braked at  the same time.What's more, the LED headlights and LED rear lights in the  characteristic Union Jack design also require very little energy. The  same applies to the MINI Cooper SE's automatic climate control. Its  interior is heated with the aid of a heat pump that absorbs waste heat  from the engine, the drive control unit and the high-voltage battery  as well as from the outside air and uses it to generate cosy  temperatures. It is characterised by particularly favourable  efficiency and uses up to 75 percent less energy than a conventional  electric heating system while providing a high level of climate  comfort in winter operation.A fitting end to the pre-Christmas sightseeing tour is a visit to the  newest observation deck in New York: The Summit One Vanderbilt (45 E  42nd Street). It is located very close to Bryant Park and Grand  Central Station and has been open to guests since October 2021.

Automated quality analyses: QC Ware The QC Ware team stood out with its approach, drawn from the field of  machine learning, that can be used in image recognition in the area of  quality analysis. The BMW Group worked closely with the Amazon Quantum    Solutions Lab Professional Services team, an expert group of  professionals, throughout the challenge, right up to the moment when  the winners were determined. AWS also provided credits for the use of  Amazon Braket, enabling the development and testing of the submitted  quantum algorithms. Amazon Braket provides a development environment  to explore and create quantum algorithms, test them on quantum circuit  simulators and run them on different quantum hardware technologies. The jury that oversaw the challenge and ultimately decided on the  winning teams also included professors from the Technical University  of Munich (TUM) as well as representatives of the BMW Group and AWS.  TUM is an important partner for the BMW Group for research in the  field of quantum computing. The BMW Group announced the establishment  of the “Quantum    Algorithms and Applications” endowed chair at TUM back in June  of this year. Algorithms close to specific use cases along the  industrial value chain are being researched at the chair. The BMW  Group is providing 5.1 million euros over a period of six years to  fund the professorship, staff and equipment at TUM. Quantum computing is one of the most promising future technologies in  the automotive sector. It has enormous potential for research into  materials, for complex optimisation problems and for the future of  automated driving. The Quantum Computing Challenge once again  underlines the BMW Group’s leading-edge role in building a quantum  ecosystem. As recently as June, the company was a founding member,  along with nine other large corporations, of the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium  (QUTAC). This aims to specifically accelerate the development of  the technology in Germany and Europe. In November this year, the BMW  Group and RWTH Aachen University jointly announced the establishment  of the “Quantum    Information Systems” endowed chair, where software and  industrialisation comeptencies will be created to realise a quantum  advantage in the medium term. Dr Peter Lehnert, Vice President BMW Group Research and New    Technologies Digital Car: “We at the BMW Group are  convinced that future technologies such as quantum computing have the  potential to make our products more desirable and sustainable. We have  succeeded in reaching the global quantum computing community with our  crowd-innovation approach and enthusing them about automotive use  cases. We look forward to continuing to work with the winners.” BMW Group reaches out to quantum computing community worldwide The BMW Group received around 70 submissions from all over the world  from different areas such as international and national research  groups, the start-up scene and established companies. The  exceptionally high quality of the submissions enables new perspectives  and offers potential for innovative approaches to solutions such as  the development and further development of new algorithms. The expert  jury took into account criteria such as comprehensibility,  feasibility, scalability, innovation and benefit for the BMW Group  when evaluating the submitted solutions. All 15 finalists set themselves apart with their high innovation  potential and have therefore been shortlisted for future projects. The  journey continues straight away for the four winners: they immediately  gain the BMW Group as a customer and will be involved in the further  development of the pilot projects. The company looks forward to  working with these four winners. The BMW Group Quantum Computing Challenge is structured around the  “Supplierthon” methodology, which is the BMW Group’s future-oriented  supplier scouting method. It marks the company’s first global  crowd-innovation initiative on this scale. The crowd innovation  approach enables innovative solutions to be found within a very short  time and to validate them in cooperation with the specialist  departments. The challenge also gave the BMW Group invaluable insights  into the status quo of the global quantum ecosystem. This knowledge is  crucial in determining the future direction of research on the future  technology and the long-term establishment of the market for quantum  computing. The successful challenge along with the extremely promising  submissions encourage the company to continue to look to the crowd  innovation approach in the future. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW iX achieves highest possible five-star rating in Euro NCAP safety assessment.;New technology flagship from the BMW Group impresses with outstanding occupant protection for adults and children.  New interactive airbag between driver and front passenger seats reduces the risk of injury in the event of a side collision.  Advanced driver assistance systems help to prevent collisions with pedestrians and cyclists;BMW iX achieves highest possible    five-star rating in Euro NCAP safety assessment. New technology flagship from the BMW Group impresses with  outstanding occupant protection for adults and children.  New  interactive airbag between driver and front passenger seats reduces  the risk of injury in the event of a side collision.  Advanced  driver assistance systems help to prevent collisions with pedestrians  and cyclists Munich. With its purely electric drive and  comprehensive range of digital features, the BMW iX represents a new  era in individual mobility. In addition, it operates at the highest  level of safety. This is according to the experts of the European New  Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) – the consumer protection  institute specialising in automotive safety – who awarded the BMW iX  the highest possible rating of five stars in the Euro NCAP safety  assessment. During the course of the test programme, which was further  intensified in 2020, the BMW Group’s new technology flagship impressed  with both its outstanding occupant protection and its advanced driver  assistance systems, which are particularly effective in helping to  prevent accidents.The BMW iX achieved five-star ratings in all test categories of the  Euro NCAP crash test. In the assessment of adult occupant protection,  the testers highlighted among other features the effectiveness of the  new interactive airbag between the driver and front passenger seats,  which provides additional protection against injury in the event of a  side collision. Child safety in the rear of the BMW iX was also given  the highest possible score for both frontal and side collisions.Meanwhile, the integrated safety concept of the BMW iX ensures the  highest level of passenger protection. In addition to precisely  coordinated restraint systems, this includes highly resilient support  structures and precisely designed deformation zones that absorb the  impact of a collision and keep it away from the passenger compartment.  The body structure of the BMW iX combines an aluminium spaceframe  concept with a carbon cage for the passenger compartment. Particularly  torsion-resistant components made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer  (CFRP) are used in the roof, side and rear sections of the BMW iX.“The BMW iX sets new standards in sustainability, and its top rating  of five stars in the Euro NCAP underlines the vehicle’s comprehensive  sustainability concept,” says Dominik Schuster, Head of Vehicle Safety  BMW. “The extremely stable body structure and the extended range of  restraint systems ensure an outstanding level of occupant protection.  In addition, the BMW iX scores highly both in the test programme and  in everyday driving with innovative driver assistance systems that  significantly reduce the risk of accidents in a wide array of  situations.” Among other features, the BMW iX has a front collision  warning system with brake intervention that can detect pedestrians and  cyclists as well as vehicles. In addition, the automatic emergency  braking system now also reacts in turning situations, helping to  minimise the risk to pedestrians when turning and the risk of  collision with oncoming traffic when turning left.If a collision does occur, the risk of injury to vulnerable road  users is reduced by carefully designed body elements and flexible  structures at the front of the vehicle. The BMW iX also features an  active bonnet, which is raised by means of a pyrotechnical triggering  mechanism as soon as the data collected by sensors indicate a  corresponding collision. This creates a deformation zone that prevents  direct impact between the pedestrian or cyclist and hard components in  the engine compartment.Other standard features of the BMW iX include an attention assistant,  lane departure warning and speed limit recognition, all of which  scored positively in the Euro NCAP crash test. The Driving Assistant  Professional package is offered as an option, which also includes  steering and lane guidance assistance. In a separate assessment, BMW’s  Driving Assistant Professional in the iX3 was also recently awarded  the top rating of “very good” by Euro NCAP.The figures for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, power  consumption and range are measured using the methods required  according to Regulation (EC) 2007/715 as amended. They refer to  vehicles on the automotive market in Germany. For ranges, the WLTP  figures take into account the effects of any optional equipment. All figures have already been determined on the basis of the new WLTP  test cycle. WLTP values are used as a basis for the assessment of  taxes and other vehicle-related levies that are (also) based on  CO2 emissions and, where applicable, for the purposes of  vehicle-specific subsidies. Further information on the WLTP and NEDC  measurement procedures can be found at www.bmw.de/wltp. More information about the official fuel consumption figures and the  official specific CO2 emissions of new passenger cars can  be obtained from the “Guideline on fuel consumption, CO2  emissions and power consumption of new passenger cars”, available free  of charge from all outlets, from Deutsche Automobil Treuhand GmbH  (DAT), Hellmuth-Hirth-Str. 1, 73760 Ostfildern-Scharnhausen, and at https://www.dat.de/co2/. Please address any queries to: Corporate Communications Dieter Falkensteiner, Press Officer BMW Group Innovation and DesignTelephone: +49-89-382-51813E-mail: Dieter.Falkensteiner@bmwgroup.com Paloma Brunckhorst, Press Officer Product Communications BMW iXTelephone: +49-89-382-22322E-mail: Paloma.Brunckhorst@bmwgroup.com Almut Stollberg, Head of Communications Innovation, Design,  Technology, Digital CarTelephone: +49 89 382 96543E-mail: Almut.Stollberg@bmw.de, Ingo Wirth, Head of Product and Brand Communications BMWTelephone: +49-89-382-25814E-mail: Ingo.Wirth@bmwgroup.com Internet: www.press.bmwgroup.com/deutschlandE-mail: presse@bmwgroup.com The BMW Group With its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Guarnoni spent a season racing in the FIM  Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in 2014. The BMW  Motorrad World Endurance Team is using the test in Almeria to continue  work on optimising the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. New components and set-up  solutions are being evaluated. Together with tyre partner Dunlop, the  team is testing a range of tyre options. Guarnoni also has the option  of using the testing to familiarise himself with the motorbike and the  team. Three race dates have already been confirmed for the  2022 season in the FIM EWC. The season starts on 16th/17th April with  the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA), the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps will  take place on 4th/5th June and the 8 Hours of Suzuka (JPN) will return  to the FIM EWC calendar on 7th August. Further race dates are yet to  be confirmed. Quotes on the Almeria test. Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team: “It has been a fantastic year for us, our first full  year in FIM EWC. I am very proud of the whole team and everyone at  BMW, as we finished second in the championship together. I think we  really deserved that, especially the victory in the final race. We are  now here testing for 2022 already. We have a lot to do over the next  few days, but I am very happy with the set-up we have now. Markus,  Ilya and Kenny are excellent guys and top riders. Jéremy Guarnoni is  new to the team. I have been a fan of his since day one. He is a real  endurance rider and a very good addition to the group. We have already  had a lot of fun, which I feel is very important.” Jéremy Guarnoni: “I have a very good impression of  the bike. The performance is really unbelievable, and I immediately  felt good on it. I am also very happy with the team, which is very  professional. I have a really good feeling about the mechanics, the  crew chief and my team-mates. I already knew Ilya, Markus and Kenny as  opponents, and now they are my team-mates. That is really cool. I am  sure we can achieve great things next season, and I am looking forward  to it.” Markus Reiterberger: “Firstly, after a good season in  2021, we know exactly what we need to work on. I am very pleased that  we still have a test this year. That is very important for us, as it  allows us to lay important foundations for the coming year. I am  pleased to be able to welcome Jéremy – another strong rider and a  former world champion – to the team. The first day of testing was  really tiring for everyone, as it was very cold and there was a lot to  test. We got through most of the programme, but there are still a few  important things to do. The initial impressions are definitely  promising. With the improvements we can still make, I believe we will  be able to make up that one position we missed out on this season. I  am very confident and pleased to be part of the team.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “It feels really good to be able to  start preparations for 2022 this year. Firstly, I would like to  welcome our new team member, Jéremy. I hope we can achieve some good  results together. He is a very experienced endurance rider and I think  we will learn a lot from each other. I am very happy to be riding with  him in the team and on this bike. We have made a few improvements. I  think we have a good overall package, with which we can win. We showed  that in the last race. We are now testing a few things, to give  ourselves an even better chance. I believe we have the potential to  challenge at the top next year.” Kenny Foray: “Our winter test is very early, but that  is very good for us. The new bike is even better than the old one. It  is really enjoyable to ride. I am hoping for a really good year for  the whole team. If I am able to contribute to us improving, then I am  definitely ready.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The two team principals, Martin Kaemena  and Fabian Finck, are responsible for this success. “For everyone in  our team, being recognised as the best private BMW M Motorsport team  in the world is a fantastic reward for all the hard work,” said  Kaemena. Finck added: “Our team has done an outstanding job this  season. As well as everything we do to create a good atmosphere within  the team, the sporting success is obviously the biggest motivation. As  such, it is great that there is such a strong manufacturer involvement  as the BMW M Sports Trophy. The intensity, with which BMW M Motorsport  supports its private teams within the framework of this competition,  is unique at this moment in time.” BMW M Motorsport attends test in Almeria with selected drivers.Last week, selected drivers were given the opportunity to show what  they are capable of at the wheel of the BMW M6 GT3, under the watchful  eyes of BMW M Motorsport engineers and BMW works driver Philipp Eng  (AUT).

Management changes in BMW Group production network; Hans-Peter Kemser named as plant director for planned site in Debrecen, Hungary  Petra Peterhänsel will take over at Plant Leipzig  ; Hans-Peter Kemser named as plant director for planned site in  Debrecen, Hungary  Petra Peterhänsel will take over at Plant  Leipzig   Munich. The BMW Group has named Hans-Peter Kemser as  plant director for the planned site in Debrecen, Hungary. He will  oversee construction of the future plant from January onwards. The  56-year-old is currently in charge of BMW Group Plant Leipzig. Petra  Peterhänsel will take over from him as head of the site in Saxony. The  55-year-old currently manages the Painted Body, i.e. press shop, body  shop and paint shop technologies, at the BMW Group’s largest European  plant in Dingolfing. Hans-Peter Kemser will bring years of expertise in the fields of  vehicle production and electromobility to his new role from January  onwards. He has been in charge of BMW Group Plant Leipzig since 2015,  where he was responsible for production of the BMW 1 Series and 2  Series ranges, as well as the fully-electric BMW i3* and, up until  2020, the BMW i8. “Hans-Peter Kemser is an absolute production expert  and his years of experience make him the perfect choice for  successfully implementing the plant ramp-up in Debrecen,” said Milan  Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible  for production. From 2025 onwards, Debrecen will produce the Neue  Klasse, which will be uncompromisingly geared towards electric drive trains. Petra Peterhänsel will take over as the new head of Plant Leipzig.  The trained quality specialist has been with the BMW Group since 2012  and brings a wealth of international experience spanning all areas of  the automotive industry. “I am delighted to welcome an experienced  production expert like Petra Peterhänsel to strengthen our management  team,” underlined Nedeljković: “Just like Hans-Peter Kemser, she  brings extensive process know-how and outstanding leadership  qualities. Both will push forward with our focus topics, the  transformation towards electromobility, digitalisation and further  expansion of sustainability.” Exciting challenges await the designated plant directors at both locations. Construction of the first buildings for the future BMW Group plant in  Debrecen in the east of Hungary will get underway in early 2022,  starting with the central office building and a training centre, to  complement the infrastructure that has already been built, with roads  and car parks, as well as water and energy supplies. The buildings and  equipment required for car production will be put out to tender in the  near future. All technologies – from press shop to body shop, paint  shop and assembly – are planned for BMW Group Plant Debrecen. The  plant will be the first production location for the Neue Klasse. Going  forward, the site will employ up to 1,000 people, so that up to  150,000 vehicles per year can be built in Hungary. At the time of its  planned commissioning in 2025, the plant will set new benchmarks for  flexibility, digitalisation and productivity in production. Electrification also continues to progress in Leipzig. The plant  recently celebrated 20 years since the decision to build in Leipzig  and, today, it is the BMW Group’s pioneer plant for electromobility:  It has been building the BMW Group’s first fully-electric vehicle, the  BMW i3*, since 2013. The location also began producing battery modules  this year, creating around 175 new jobs in this area so far. The  company has already decided to further increase capacity: A second  production line will come on stream in 2022. The expertise and  experience gained by staff at our site in the field of electromobility  over the years will also be leveraged for production of the successor  to the MINI Countryman, which will be built in Leipzig as a  fully-electric vehicle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

" BMW continues successful audio entertainment format and makes it interactive: Second season of the podcast thriller ""Hypnopolis"" launched."; The story by British star author Robert Valentine is based on future scenarios which deal with the topics of mobility and life in the city  New episodes focus on the circular economy. Elaborate production in Hamburg and Los Angeles  Listeners can influence the action with short voice commands ;"Munich. The English-language podcast thriller  ""Hypnopolis"" by BMW is being continued. The second season of  the successful audio entertainment format starts today. It is  completely fictional, stands out from the competition and is the first  ever interactive podcast published by a brand. The episodes of the  first season released last year, starring time-travelling journalist  Hope Reiser, topped the podcast charts and were played in 26 countries. ""Hypnopolis II, Utopia in progress"" bases its plot, even  more so than in the first season, on data-based future scenarios from  the BMW Group. The main focus is on the megatrend of the circular  economy and the responsible use of resources. The protagonists of the  new edition of the eco-thriller travel in futuristic airships to  stunning locations of a slowly regenerating world, such as a solar and  recycling farm in North Africa. The ""Hypnopolis"" story  deliberately focuses neither on the BMW brand nor on vehicles, but it  does draw on the expertise of the BMW Group. The plot is based on  assumptions made by the company's ‘future” experts - for example about  how cities and mobility will develop.BMW now focuses even more on a futuristic storytelling format as part  of its highly regarded audio strategy. The listening experience has  been improved even further. Conceived by the British star author  Robert Valentine together with the Hamburg creative agency Jung von  Matt/NEXT ALSTER and elaborate production in Los Angeles and Hamburg,  ""Hypnopolis II"" season is an interactive podcast. Listeners  can influence events with individual decisions by speaking short voice  commands. So the outcome of the story varies depending on the choices  a listener makes. This makes the podcast even more personal, authentic  and entertaining. ""With the second part of our successful  fictional podcast series, we are providing an even more personalised  listening experience with new, interactive elements. Listeners can  influence the course of the story through their decisions - this is  how we emotionalise the brand and consistently follow our  customer-centred marketing approach,"" says Stefan Ponikva, Head  of BMW Brand Communication and Experience.Since the format has also been implemented in the entertainment  programme of BMW vehicles, customers can enjoy the podcast as an  ""in-car experience"". ""Hypnopolis"" alongside  ""Changing Lanes"", ""Creators of a different beat""  and ""KulturMobile.

Shaping the future of quantum computing together: BMW Group and RWTH Aachen University sign contract for “Quantum Information Systems” endowed chair.; € 5.5 million for endowed chair and networking fund  An important milestone for the industrialisation of quantum computing  ;"Munich / Aachen. As one of the most promising future  technologies, quantum computing has an enormous innovation potential.  The BMW Group will in the future support research into the future  technology of quantum computing at the RWTH Aachen University, thus  once again emphasising its leading role in the development of a  quantum ecosystem.Prof. Dr. Ulrich Rüdiger, Rector of the RWTH Aachen University,  Alexander Buresch, CIO of BMW AG, and Dr. Stefan Floeck, Executive  Mentor of the Strategic Partnership of the BMW Group and RWTH Aachen  University and Senior Vice President Product Line MINI and BMW Compact  Class, have signed the contract for establishing the ""Quantum  Information Systems"" endowed chair.The BMW Group is providing € 4.5 million over a period of six years  for professorship, equipment, and employees at the RWTH Aachen  University. A further € 1.0 million will be paid into a networking  fund that supports industrial research projects and ensures that the  chair is integrated in the university environment and in the research  centre Jülich. In the chair the use cases from the core business of  the BMW Group with a potential quantum advantage are contemplated  comprehensively in terms of industrialisation. The common higher-order  objective of the RWTH Aachen University and the BMW Group is to close  the gap between outstanding basic research in Germany and the  applicability of quantum computing in industry.Dr. Stefan Floeck: “The BMW Group can look back on  many years of strategic partnership with the RWTH Aachen University.  The close cooperation between companies and universities is mutually  beneficial – we at the BMW Group are convinced of that. With its  excellent networked ecosystem and technological focus, the RWTH Aachen  University is the perfect home for the endowed chair, which will offer  valuable insight into the industrialisation of quantum solutions.”Prof. Dr. Ulrich Rüdiger: “Quantum technology is one of the major topics of  the future, with enormous innovation potential for our social  progress. With this endowed professorship, we can intensify our  research in this area. As RWTH Aachen University, we like working in  networks. We are convinced that we achieve the best solutions for  future topics through a continuous exchange of knowledge and  technology with partners from science, industry and society.”Alexander Buresch: “The endowed chair at the RWTH  Aachen University is an important step towards the potential use of  quantum computing at the BMW Group. It creates software and  integration competencies that are necessary for the industrialisation  of the quantum computing ecosystem. Together with the Quantum  Algorithms and Applications endowed chair at the Technical University  of Munich, which we announced in June this year, we hope to unlock  potential within the automotive value chain based on an end-to-end approach.”Another endowed chair for outstanding basic research in  GermanyQuantum computing utilises quantum mechanical  effects to accelerate computing capacity. As one of the most promising  technologies of the future, it has the potential to push the limits of  what is possible to date and revolutionise fields of application from  material research to automated driving. The technology environment in  the field of quantum computing is still only in its beginnings.  University collaborations thus offer great potential.On 16 June of this year, the BMW Group, together with the Technical  University of Munich (TUM), already announced the establishment of the  ""Quantum Algorithms and Applications"" endowed chair. The BMW  Group will provide € 5.1 million over a period of six years for  professorship, equipment, and employees at TUM. The chair addresses  the development of algorithms related to use cases along the  industrial value chain.For the BMW Group, the ""Quantum Information Systems""  endowed chair at RWTH Aachen University is an important addition to  the existing chair in Munich. It contemplates use cases from the BMW  Group's core business comprehensively in terms of industrialisation.  Software integration and industrialisation skills are being created to  implement a quantum advantage in the medium term.The strategic partnership between the RWTH Aachen University    and the BMW GroupAs one of the leading technical  universities in Europe, the RWTH Aachen University has been a  strategic partner of the BMW Group since 2017. The RWTH Innovation is  responsible for the key account management of the cooperation as the  university's central, cross-university research and technology  transfer unit. It supports the BMW Group in networking, initiating,  and coordinating projects at the RWTH Aachen University. Dr. Stefan  Floeck, Senior Vice President Product Line MINI and BMW Compact Class,  was appointed Executive Mentor of the partnership and is thus the link  between the BMW Group and the RWTH Aachen University. His role  includes continuously developing the partnership and pressing ahead  with the cooperation.The scientists and also the young academics at the technical  university are already cooperating closely with the development  departments of the BMW Group. The BMW Group itself provides students  with practical information on requirements from industry. This can  also be seen in the research promotion project KIZAM (Artificial  Intelligence in requirements management). Four institutes of RWTH  Aachen University, four departments of the BMW Group and four other  industrial partners are involved in research on how Artificial  Intelligence can accelerate and improve product development. The first  joint Technology Day was a highlight of the strategic partnership,  which provided a platform for dialogue between science and business in  June of this year.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW returns to Art Basel in Miami Beach as official automotive partner. Launching the new BMW Concept XM, BMW features artist Kennedy Yanko and Grammy-award winner NAS.;BMW is again official partner of Art Basel in Miami Beach in 2021. As longstanding global partner of the shows in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong Kong, BMW once again offers its VIP shuttle service and celebrates 50 years of BMW Group Cultural Engagement with the presentation of the new BMW XM concept car together with the artist Kennedy Yanko and hip-hop legend NAS.;Munich/Miami Beach. BMW is again official partner of  Art Basel in Miami Beach in 2021. In the latest chapter of the  partnership, BMW held the official world premiere of an all-new  concept vehicle, the BMW Concept XM, on Monday, November 29 in Miami  Beach. As longstanding global partner of the shows in Basel, Miami  Beach and Hong Kong, BMW once again offers its VIP shuttle service and  celebrates 50 years of BMW Group Cultural Engagement with the  presentation of the new BMW XM concept car together with the artist  Kennedy Yanko and hip-hop legend NAS.         The BMW Concept XM, an all-new standalone concept vehicle by BMW M,  was debuted at a special event on Monday, November 29 at Herzog &  de Meuron’s famous 1111 Lincoln Road parking deck in Miami Beach,  Florida. The vehicle embodies a radically new concept: a  zero-compromise BMW M with striking BMW X design language including  the new, progressive front-end design of BMW’s forthcoming  luxury-class models which can be seen on the BMW Concept XM for the  first time.The world premiere treated guests to the concept vehicle debut, a  sculpture of art specially created by Kennedy Yanko for the event, and  a special musical performance by GRAMMY-award winning hip-hop and  recording artist NAS. Creative freedom and partnership at eye level  are essential for BMW Group’s cultural engagement.“This moment of co-creation between visual art and music by Kennedy  Yanko and NAS brings together two cultural fields that have inspired  each other for many decades and are two main areas of BMW brand  cooperations,” said Stefan Ponikva, Head of BMW Brand Communication  and Experience. “It all started with a dialogue with our designers  around the BMW Concept XM and this exchange on eye-level is what makes  our collaborations authentic. And Art Basel as the most renowned art  fair with plenty creative and expressive minds across the disciplines,  offers us the perfect platform to present our latest cultural engagement.““Art Basel in Miami Beach is the perfect moment to launch the BMW  Concept XM, a product unlike anything we’ve ever produced,” said Uwe  Dreher, vice president of marketing, BMW of North America. “This  unique concept vehicle is matched perfectly to the expressive artwork  from our partner artists, underscoring BMW Group’s five-decade long  commitment to supporting culture and the arts in meaningful ways.”Kennedy Yanko is a Brooklyn, New York-based artist and sculptor.  Using the BMW Concept XM as inspiration, she created an original  sculpture work utilized in the activation. The piece was inspired by a  creative dialogue with NAS starting point of which was the encounter  of the artists with the BMW Concept XM. “Intrinsic Sage”, as the  artwork is called, joins paint skin and metal in a surge of intuition.  Created with the artist's spirit in mind, this piece emphasizes the  power that comes from following one's creative impulse towards  innovation. Its namesake nods towards the sanctity of a deep  consciousness that can only come from trusting one’s innate knowing.  “Intrinsic Sage” will be on display alongside the BMW Concept XM at  the Miami Beach convention center at the north side of the Grand  Ballroom Level 2 from December 1-4.Besides the recent artist collaboration on the occasion of Art Basel  in Miami Beach, Art Basel and BMW founded the BMW Art Journey in 2015  – an initiative to support emerging to mid-career artists. The BMW Art  Journey can take an artist almost anywhere in the world – to research,  to network, to envision and to create new work. After the journey  through Europe and Mexico of BMW Art Journey winner 2020, Leelee Chan,  BMW presents the collectable of the sculptor summarizing her  experiences and impression from her journey “Tokens from Time.” The  book is published by Hatje Cantz and available online.Since more than 50 years after its first edition, Art Basel has  become one of the artworld’s leading events, attracting gallerists,  artists, curators, journalists, and art lovers from all over the globe  edition after edition. BMW Group is delighted to take part in this  success story as a long-term partner of the shows in Basel, Miami  Beach and Hong Kong. The BMW Group laid the foundation of its cultural  commitment in 1971. At that time the artists Gerhard Richter was  commissioned to create three large-scale paintings for the entrance  hall of the new Munich corporate headquarters. Since then, a hundred  long-term cultural initiatives of the BMW Group in the fields of  modern and contemporary art, classical music, jazz and sound as well  as in architecture and design have been well established throughout  the decades. BMW Group was receiving manifold congratulatory  messages to celebrate 50 years of BMW Group’s cultural engagement.More information about the BMW Concept XM can be found at BMW USA News and  the BMW    Group PressClub. For further questions please contact:Prof. Dr  Thomas GirstBMW Group Corporate and Governmental  AffairsGlobal Head of Cultural Engagement BMW  GroupTelephone: +49-89-382-24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comwww.press.bmwgroup.com Email:    presse@bmw.deSarah DegenArt BaselSenior Media Relations  ManagerEmail: press@artbasel.com;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The BMW Concept XM – power and luxury beyond all conventions.;Munich. At Art Basel’s 2021 Miami Beach show, BMW M GmbH is presenting an expressive new vehicle concept on the global stage for the first time: the BMW Concept XM.;Munich. At Art Basel’s 2021 Miami Beach show, BMW M  GmbH is presenting an expressive new vehicle concept on the global  stage for the first time. The BMW Concept XM looks ahead to the most  powerful BMW M car ever to go into series production, which is set to  begin at the end of next year. At the same time, the BMW Concept XM  shines the spotlight on standout aspects of the M brand.  Electrification underpins an extraordinary driving experience which  allows the driver to both glide along in near silence and enjoy the  time-honoured pleasure of high performance, M-style. The BMW Concept  XM provides a first glimpse of the new front-end design for BMW’s  forthcoming luxury-class models. It will also introduce its audience  to a highly progressive and distinctive take on BMW X model design and  an all-new form of luxury and sense of space for the interior.The series-production model – the BMW XM – will be built from the end  of 2022 at BMW Group Plant Spartanburg in the USA, the most important  sales market for the new high-performance car. BMW M will therefore be  introducing its first standalone vehicle since the legendary BMW M1 in  the year it celebrates its 50th anniversary.  The BMW XM  will be available in plug-in hybrid form only and exclusively as an M model.The bold exterior styling of the Concept XM reflects the car’s  exceptional performance attributes: dynamism, agility and precision,  plus an all-electric range of up to 80 km. The newly developed M  Hybrid drive system in the BMW Concept XM brings together a V8 engine  and a high-performance electric motor to develop maximum output of 550  kW/750 hp and peak torque of 1,000 Nm (737 lb-ft). The first  electrified vehicle from BMW M GmbH in the high-performance segment is  therefore pointing the way for the future of the brand.“The BMW Concept XM represents a complete re-imagining of the  high-performance car segment,” says Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M  GmbH. “It underlines the ability of BMW M GmbH to break with  established conventions and push boundaries in order to offer fans of  the brand the ultimate driving experience. The series-production car –  the first pure BMW M model since the legendary BMW M1 – also shows how  we are approaching the step-by-step electrification of our brand.”BMW M goes its own way in the luxury  segment.The BMW Concept XM sees BMW M GmbH forging a  distinctive path in the luxury segment. The car’s exterior majors on  presence and extrovert appeal. Inside the car, a special take on the  driver-focused cockpit for which M models are renowned meets an  all-new rear compartment design: with its high-comfort seats and  illuminated, sculptural headliner, the M Lounge offers passengers a  luxurious retreat.“The design of the BMW Concept XM is an extravagant statement by BMW  M in the heart of the luxury segment,” says Domagoj Dukec, Head of BMW  Design. “It has a unique identity and embodies an expressive lifestyle  like no other model in the BMW line-up.”The front end: progressive design for maximum presence.  The BMW Concept XM debuts the new, progressive  front-end design for BMW’s luxury-class models, a version of which  will be seen for the first time in 2022 as part of the BMW model  offensive in the luxury segment. The headlights have been split into  two separate modules, a new design feature which creates a visually  arresting appearance. The daytime driving light signature in the  sharply styled, slim upper module is particularly eye-catching. The  horizontal kidney grille sits boldly between the headlights and tapers  towards the outer edges, producing a near-octagonal outline that  emphasises the front end’s dynamic character. The black kidney grille  elements are enclosed within an intricate surround and appear almost  to be floating freely within a High-gloss Black surface. M-style  double bars within the grille add to the perception of width.  Eye-catching contour lighting sets off the grille to fine effect,  ensuring the striking composition of kidneys and daytime driving  lights is immediately recognisable in the dark as well. The new XM  logo in the kidney grille and the large air intakes hint at the power  of the V8 engine, which teams up with the electric motor to form the M  Hybrid system.M-specific details point to compromise-free  performance.The glasshouse of the BMW Concept XM rises  up vertically, accentuating the front end’s strong, imposing feel. The  colour of the roof contrasts with the black finish of the A-pillars.  The windscreen seems to have an even heavier rake as a result,  injecting modern dynamism into the front end. Slim LED searchlights  have been incorporated into the roof above the A-pillars. The boldly  sculpted bonnet extends the contours of the kidney grille back in the  form of two power domes. A pair of air intakes in the bonnet mimic the  appearance of the LED searchlights in the roof and add extra dynamic  flair. Framing the statuesque body at its lower edge are the clean-cut  black surfaces of the front apron. Triangular body-coloured blades at  the outer edges accentuate the vertical air intakes while emphasising  the sporty and robust stance of the BMW Concept XM.The side view: an expression of unbridled dynamism.  The powerful and heavily contoured proportions of the  BMW Concept XM highlight the car’s resolutely standalone identity and  draw the eye to the coupé-like character of the body. The visually  striking front end, long bonnet and stretched, sloping roofline  present a characterful two-box design with a distinctive outline. The  window graphic narrows significantly as it approaches the rear,  enriching the dynamism of the side view.The two-tone paint finish of the BMW Concept XM further accentuates  its distinctive lines: the upper section is in matt gold-bronze, while  the lower section sports the Space Grey metallic shade. Below the  window graphic, a broad, High-gloss Black line – the “black belt” –  separates the two exterior colours. The signature M exterior mirrors  give the car a clean-cut and technical, sporty edge. The charging flap  rearwards of the front-left wheel is a reminder of the M Hybrid drive  system at work.Throughout the side view, deliberately short character lines, which  start off boldly before fading softly, accentuate the car’s agile,  modern feel. The expressive rear lights extend well into the car’s  flanks and create an eye-catching transition into the rear. The black  cladding typical of BMW X models above the wheels and on the side  skirts is very clearly defined and gives the body an elevated  appearance. The elongated body sits on 23-inch light-alloy wheels,  which bring extra power and solidity to the side view.The rear: powerful stature and newly interpreted  design.The design of the rear end likewise accentuates  the car’s powerful stature, and the BMW Concept XM cuts a low and  sporty figure from this angle. The rear window is inserted almost  seamlessly into the rear end. The fresh interpretation of the design  can also be seen in the arrangement of the BMW logo, which is  laser-etched into the window below each of the two cant rails. This is  a stylistic reference to the BMW M1, to date the only example of a  standalone model developed exclusively by BMW M GmbH.Lower down at the rear end, prominently flared wheel arches draw  attention to the car’s powerful stance on the road. Extremely slim and  boldly L-shaped rear lights extending across almost the entire width  of the rear add to the effect. The lights themselves have a dark  appearance when not active, giving way to a precise and uniform shade  of red when switched on. Dominating the rear apron are the  characteristic twin tailpipes of BMW M models. The dual-branch,  twin-tailpipe exhaust system employed here reduces backpressure for  the V8 engine and also generates the emotionally rich M-typical  soundtrack accompanying the engine’s imposing power delivery. The  vertical arrangement and hexagonal interpretation of the tailpipes  breathe new life into this classically iconic feature.The interior design – high performance and extrovert  luxury.Inside the BMW Concept XM, the driver will find  a distinctive M interpretation of driver-focused cockpit design. The  lines and surface design of the instrument panel, centre console, door  trim and seats give the ambience in the front compartment a  progressive feel with their powerful geometry and high-quality  materials. Brown, vintage-look leather, copper and carbon fibre create  a bridge between luxury and motor sport. A bold trim element provides  clear visual separation between the driver’s area and the other  sections of the car.Inside the cockpit area, a decorative surface made from carbon fibre  with interwoven copper thread creates a sporty and exclusive base for  displays, air vents and control/operating elements. The new BMW Curved  Display screen grouping positioned above it creates a neat balance  between traditional driver focus and modern digitality. Red accents on  the steering wheel and centre console are M-specific references to the  car’s sporting prowess. A trio of vertical elements presented in the  three colours of the BMW M brand logo form the heart of the centre console.Spacious and luxurious: the M Lounge. The  unwavering driver focus of the front compartment contrasts with the  extravagant and luxurious lounge-like ambience in the rear of the BMW  Concept XM. Special materials, visually powerful surfaces and  expressive details turn the rear seats into the unique M Lounge,  black-tinted rear side windows underscoring the abiding sense of  privacy here. While warm brown leather dominates the cockpit, the rear  is decked out in the rich colour shade Petrol. The large rear seat  bench with its deep seat recesses forms an inviting space to relax.  Only the diamond-shaped area of the head restraints – which provides  the supporting function familiar from BMW M Sport seats in other  models – is leather-trimmed. The lower sections of the seats offer  high comfort and an exclusive couch character with their luxurious  velvet upholstery and diamond quilting. Deep-pile carpeting with a  diamond pattern adds to the exclusive impression.Illuminated and sculptural: the headliner.The visual highlight of the cabin is its  headliner with a three-dimensional prism structure. A combination of  indirect and direct lighting produces a relief-like structure which  showcases the headliner as an exclusive work of art. Together with the  ambient lighting, it highlights the BMW Concept XM’s blend of luxury  and comfort to extremely striking effect. The ambient lighting can be  activated in the three BMW M colours.BMW Curved Display with M-specific user interface.Based on the latest generation of BMW iDrive, the M-specific  version of the control/operation system translates the  high-performance character of the BMW Concept XM into the digital  world. Showcased in the familiar three M colours, the user interface  lends itself perfectly to a sporty driving experience. It visualises  the modes of the hybrid drive system as well as the pure-electric  driving mode with captivating aesthetic appeal. The BMW Curved Display  provides the perfect stage for showing off this bespoke design and  previews the user interface that will bring extra intensity to the  driving experience in all future BMW M models. Overview          ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Electrifying moments at BMW Welt: First customers take delivery of their fully-electric BMW i4 vehicles.; With its two innovative technology flagships, the BMW i4 and BMW iX, the BMW Group line-up now features five fully-electric vehicles  Bernhard Kuhnt, Senior Vice President BMW Group Market Germany: “One in four BMWs in Germany already electrified”   ;"Munich. From the heart of the BMW brand –  fully-electric on the road: The first BMW i4 vehicles were delivered  at the BMW Welt last weekend. Bernhard Kuhnt, Senior Vice    President BMW Group Market Germany, is delighted: ""It  is a very special moment for us when we hand over brand new models to  customers for the first time. The BMW i4 shows in an emotional way how  well fully-electric mobility and sporty driving dynamics fit together.  For us, it is therefore clear: the BMW i4 will offer our customers a  whole new dimension of driving pleasure."" On this special occasion, the BMW Group did not miss the opportunity  to invite the customers of the first BMW i4s to an accompanying  programme around the fully-electric Gran Coupé in Munich. Customers are excitedStefan Ballin, owner of an electrical contracting company and one of  the first customers, was delighted to take delivery of his BMW i4: “It  wasn’t possible, at the time I placed the order, to take a test drive,  but I knew the BMW i4 was exactly the right car for me! I was  impressed by the concept – the symbiosis of range, elegant design and  unmistakeable BMW sportiness. I also wanted a car that would show how  we, as an innovative company, can comfortably integrate  electromobility into both our private and working environments. I’m  also looking forward to sporty driving pleasure with zero emissions in  the i4 – because the electricity I need to run it will come from our  own photovoltaic system.” Bernhardt Kuhnt confirmed: “With the BMW i4, we have  absolutely struck a chord. You can see this from the very high demand  for this car. We are delighted to be expanding our electrified product  line-up with this sporty, fully-electric Gran Coupé at exactly the  right time and to present the first vehicles to our customers today –  three months earlier than originally planned. The first delivery of a  BMW i4 today, and the first BMW iX in about a week, are further  milestones for the BMW Group on the road to electromobility.” One in four BMW Group vehicles in Germany electrifiedKuhnt goes on to explain: “One in four BMWs delivered in Germany  today already comes with a fully-electric drive train or is a plug-in  hybrid. By the end of the third quarter, around 41,900 electrified  BMWs and 8,820 electrified MINIs had been delivered to customers this  year. The fully-electric MINI Cooper SE alone already accounts for  about 20 percent of MINI brand sales. The BMW Group has almost doubled  its sales of electrified models in Germany compared with the previous  year, at around 25 percent.” Impressive driving dynamics thanks to model-specific chassis    technology and electric drive trainThe BMW i4 combines characteristic sportiness with elegant design –  and brings electromobility to the traditional core of the BMW brand.  The four-door Gran Coupé is the first fully-electric BMW consistently  geared towards driving dynamics. Impressive driving dynamics and high  range are combined by harnessing the power of efficient drive  technology and intelligent lightweight construction. Range and innovative technology were also purchasing considerations  for Ronny Scharschmidt, whose firm implements regional construction  projects with renewable energies: “I decided on the i4 because of the  range and the many new driving functions and on-board sensors that  make driving safer and more comfortable. My first long drive in the  BMW i4 will be from Munich directly home to Saxony-Anhalt: In the  meantime, there are enough fast chargers that you don’t have to worry  about charging anymore.” Convenient chargingWhen BMW Group customers buy an electrified vehicle, it comes with a  BMW or MINI Charging Card that gives them access to one of the world’s  largest charging networks. BMW also offers two options for convenient  charging at home: the BMW Wallbox and the Smart Wallbox from BMW Group  partner NewMotion. For example, this wallbox also enables company car  drivers to precisely record charging processes for accounting purposes.  BMW Group electro-offensive continuesIn addition to the two main innovation flagships, the BMW iX and BMW  i4, the BMW i3, MINI SE* and BMW iX3* are already on the market. These  will be followed in the coming years by fully-electric versions of the  BMW 7 Series, BMW X1 and the high-volume BMW 5 Series. Every plant in  Germany will produce fully-electric cars from 2022 onwards. A  fully-electric successor to the MINI Countryman and the all-electric  Rolls-Royce Spectre will also be released onto the market. By 2023,  the BMW Group will have at least one fully-electric model on the roads  in about 90 percent of its current market segments. The BMW Group  expects fully-electric vehicles to account for at least 50 percent of  its global sales in 2030. *Consumption/emissions data:BMW iX3: Power consumption in kWh/100 km combined:  18.9-18.5 WLTPMINI Cooper SE: Power consumption in kWh/100 km  combined: 16.9-14.9 NEDC, 17.6-15.2 WLTPIf you have any questions, please contact:   BMW Group Corporate Communications Micaela Sandstede, press spokesperson, Market GermanyTelephone: +49 89 382-61611E-mail: Micaela.sandstede@bmwgroup.com Eckhard Wannieck, Head of Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesTelephone: +49 89 382-24544E-mail: eckhard.wannieck@bmwgroup.com Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comE-mail: presse@bmw.de  The BMW Group With its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Emission-free city centres: BMW eDrive Zones now available in 138 European cities.; Innovative eDrive Zones for local emission-free driving available in 20 new  cities  Around three million kilometers driven electrically instead of “fossil” in three months  Plug-in hybrids make sense for many real-world customer driving profiles ;"Munich. The BMW Group is introducing its innovative  eDrive Zones in another 20 European cities, including Copenhagen,  Verona and Toulouse. This means that a total of 138 cities in Europe  are now benefiting from this trailblazing technology. The service is  expected to be rolled out in at least another 30 cities worldwide in  the coming year.In an eDrive Zone, BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles automatically switch  to all-electric driving mode upon entering inner city areas. Then, the  plug-in hybrid models drive locally emission-free – just like purely  electric vehicles – and with low fuel costs, as electric motors are  much more efficient than combustion engines for driving in city  traffic. The vehicle recognises the designated areas using geofencing  technology and GPS. The automated eDrive feature is available as  standard in many existing and all future BMW plug-in hybrids. Drivers  are rewarded with bonus points for each all-electric kilometre driven  – and with double points in an eDrive Zone – which they can redeem for  charging credit. In turn, drivers also collect bonus points while  charging their vehicle.The 20 latest cities to be added are: Aberdeen, Bregenz, Brescia,  Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff, Copenhagen, Cork, Coventry, Florence,  Klagenfurt, Lille, Matosinhos, Naples, Oeiras, Oxford, Sheffield, St.  Pölten, Toulouse and Verona.More quality of life in inner cities thanks to eDrive Zones. BMW eDrive Zones and the loyalty program for charging credit are a  success story – for inner city emissions levels and for drivers. An  overview of the usage data shows: Plug-in hybrids as important technology to meet the BMW Group    fleet target of 50% less CO2 emissions per kilometre by 2030.As electric mobility gathers pace, the BMW Group has consciously  opted for fully electric models and plug-in hybrid technology. The  company offers a total of 17 plug-in hybrid models in 95 markets  worldwide. eDrive Zones will now enable the potential of this  technology to be leveraged even further: if the plug-in hybrid vehicle  is charged regularly, daily distances in particular can be covered  locally emission-free. This includes millions of daily commutes in  Europe, for example. In urban centres with high volumes of traffic,  plug-in hybrids make an important contribution towards reducing  CO2. Using this technology also cuts pollution and noise  and thus improves the quality of life in cities. Over their entire  life cycle, BMW plug-in hybrids have a demonstrably lower  CO2 impact than conventionally powered models, even when  charged with EU normal electricity instead of green electricity. BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles have long offered considerable    benefits as compared to those with traditional drives: Consistent advancement of BMW plug-in hybrid technology.The market launch of the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer next year  marks the start of a broad roll-out of fifth-generation BMW plug-in  hybrids. It uses state-of-the-art components of the latest BMW Gen5  technology, such as the highly integrated e-drive unit, in which the  e-machine, transmission and power electronics are compactly combined  in a single body. This brings additional significant increases in  terms of efficiency and dynamics. Positive overall CO2 balance for BMW plug-in hybrids.Sometimes the ""real"" life cycle assessment of plug-in  hybrid vehicles is questioned, especially in markets with a low share  of green electricity in the public grid. For BMW plug-in-hybrid  models, the BMW Group has had CO2 certificates drawn up for  the entire cycle from raw material procurement, supply chain,  production and use phase to recycling.When charging with European average electricity during the use  phase, the BMW  plug-in-hybrid models show substantial CO2  savings compared to their conventionally driven counterparts. The BMW  Group does not launch an electrified vehicle without proof of this kind. List of cities with BMW eDrive Zones as of November 2021.The benefits of the digital BMW eDrive Zone service can be  experienced in a large number of major European cities. The list will  be expanded in the future to include additional countries and cities,  so that the electric driving shares of plug-in hybrid models can be  increased further in a steadily growing number of city areas. In  Germany, many of the eDrive Zones are identical to the so-called  “Umweltzonen”. Currently, eDrive Zones are available in the  following cities: Aachen, Aberdeen, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Augsburg,  Balingen, Barcelona, Basel, Bath, Belfast, Bergen, Berlin, Bern,  Birmingham, Bonn, Bordeaux, Braga, Breda, Bregenz, Bremen, Brescia,  Bristol, Bruges, Brussels, Cambridge, Cardiff, Charleroi, Copenhagen,  Cork, Coventry, Darmstadt, Den Haag, Dinslaken, Dublin, Düsseldorf,  Edinburgh, Eindhoven, Erfurt, Eschweiler, Firenze, Frankfurt am Main,  Freiburg im Breisgau, Geneva, Ghent, Glasgow, Gothenburg, Graz,  Groningen, Hagen, Halle (Saale), Hannover, Hasselt, Heidelberg,  Heidenheim an der Brenz, Heilbronn, Herrenberg, Ilsfeld, Innsbruck,  Karlsruhe, Klagenfurt, Köln, Krefeld, Langenfeld (Rheinland), Leipzig,  Leonberg, Leuven, Liège, Lille, Limburg an der Lahn, Limerick, Linz,  Lissabon, Liverpool, London, Ludwigsburg, Luxembourg, Luzern, Lyon,  Madrid, Magdeburg, Mainz, Malmö, Manchester, Mannheim, Marburg,  Marseille, Matosinhos, Milano, Mönchengladbach, Mons, Mühlacker,  München, Münster, Namur, Napoli, Neuss, Nürnberg, Oeiras, Offenbach am  Main, Oslo, Osnabrück, Overath, Oxford, Paris, Pfinztal, Pforzheim,  Porto, Regensburg, Remscheid, Reutlingen, Rome, Rotterdam, Ruhrgebiet,  Salzburg, Schramberg, Schwäbisch Gmünd, Sheffield, Siegen, St.Pölten,  Stavanger, Stockholm, Strasbourg, Stuttgart, Tilburg, Toulouse,  Trondheim, Tübingen, Turin, Ulm, Uppsala, Urbach, Utrecht, Verona,  Vienna, Wendlingen am Neckar, Wiesbaden, Wuppertal, Zurich.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This unique offer in the  history of BMW M will be available for order from the end of January 2022.In addition to the emblems, 50 iconic and historically significant  BMW M paint finishes will be offered for selected models in the  anniversary year 2022. Style-defining colors such as Dakar Yellow,  Fire Orange, Daytona Violet, Macao Blue, Imola Red or Frozen Marina  Bay Blue refer to the various eras of BMW M's 50-year history.The BMW logo with the shifted semicircles in blue, violet and red was  first used in 1973 on the racing car of BMW Motorsport GmbH, which had  been established a year before. In 1978 and with the debut of the BMW  M1 the three color stripes slanted to the right and leaning on the  letter M followed. Even beyond the motorsport scene it became a  trademark with particularly high recognition value and identification  power. The legendary BMW M1 was the only BMW M high-performance  production vehicle to bear the historic motorsport emblem in addition  to the logo with the three color stripes. In both logos, the blue  stands for BMW, while the red symbolizes racing and the violet  expresses the connection between the two. In the meantime, the violet  has given way to a dark blue, and BMW Motorsport GmbH has been  operating under the name BMW M GmbH since 1993. Nothing has changed  the high symbolic power of the brand and logo. In its 50th  year of existence, the company is more successful than ever as the  world market leader in the performance and high-performance automotive segment.""With the classic 'BMW Motorsport' emblem, we would like to  share our joy about the anniversary of BMW M GmbH with the fans of the  brand,"" says Franciscus van Meel, Chairman of the Board of  Management of BMW M GmbH. ""We have a great year ahead of us,  which will be celebrated with unique product highlights and exciting  performances. The M has long been considered the strongest letter in  the world, and in our company's anniversary year it is stronger than ever.""BMW M GmbH is also aiming for another sales record in 2021. Its  performance and high-performance automobiles are enjoying steadily  growing popularity worldwide, which will be fueled once again with new  product highlights in the anniversary year. For the first time, the  company is launching a BMW M3 Touring in the course of 2022. In  addition, particularly performance-oriented fans of the brand can look  forward to a spectacular special model of the BMW M4 Coupé series. The  successor model to the successful BMW M2 is also already at an  advanced stage of its series development process. In parallel, the  electrification of the BMW M brand is also being driven forward. In  the anniversary year, the first electrified high-performance model in  the history of BMW M GmbH will be launched.BMW M GmbH will not only celebrate its anniversary with attractive  new products, but also with numerous events. Anniversary performances  are planned in May 2022 at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on  Lake Como in Northern Italy, followed by the Goodwood Festival of  Speed in Great Britain and the Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach,  California. The 24-hour race at the Nürburgring is also a welcome  occasion for BMW M GmbH to review its own successful history together  with fans and to thrill them for the future of BMW M GmbH.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW M Motorsport News, 23rd November 2021.;Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you a regular overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. ;24 Hours of Sebring: ST Racing claims multiple titles in the    24H Series.The 2021 season of the 24H Series drew to a close at the weekend with  the 24-hour race at Sebring (USA). The ST Racing team’s first year in  endurance racing proved to be an extremely successful one. The trio of  Samantha Tan (CAN), Chandler Hull and Jon Miller (both USA) won three  of the eight races in the GT4 class at the wheel of the BMW M4 GT4.  Tan, Hull and Chandler competed alongside Nick Wittmer (CAN) and  Bryson Morris (USA) at the 24 Hours of Sebring. They finished second  in the class, which was enough to earn ST Racing no fewer than six  titles in the 24H Series. The team won the Overall GT Teams and the  GT4 class Teams classifications. Tan, Hull and Miller were crowned  Overall GT Drivers and GT4 class Drivers champions, while Tan picked  up the titles in the GT4 Drivers GT Junior Cup and the GT Ladies Cup. “We owe each and every member of our team a massive thank you for  consistently working hard and putting in their best effort throughout  the season to make it all happen,” Tan said. “It definitely wasn’t  easy and we had our fair share of disappointments, but we never gave  up and thankfully it all paid off in the end. Thank you also to BMW M  Motorsport and our partners.” Next season, ST Racing will compete in  the GT3 class, in which it will run the new BMW M4 GT3. Another BMW M Motorsport team raced in the 24 Hours of Sebring with  the BMW M4 GT4, in the form of Team ACP – Tanger Associates. They also  made it onto the podium. Catesby Jones, Jim Norman, Josh Norman and  Ken Goldberg (all USA) finished third in the GT4 class.  Macau: BMW M4 GT4 triumphs at the Guia Circuit.The iconic Guia Circuit in Macau (MAC) is traditionally the venue of  spectacular street racing each November. This was the case again last  weekend, with races in various different categories. They included the  MGM Greater Bay Area GT Cup, which featured five BMW M4 GT4s fielded  by BMW M Motorsport teams from Asia, and the BMW M4 GT4 was unbeatable  at the Guia Circuit. Two races were held on Saturday and Sunday. In  both races, Shan Chien Chang (TPE) claimed dominant victories in the  #88 BMW M4 GT4 run by Harmony Racing. The TORO Racing team also  claimed a further two podium results. In race one, Cheng Zun Chen  (CHN) finished runner-up in the #34 BMW M4 GT4. His team-mate Evan Hiu  Kong Mak (HKG / #99) was third in race two.  Super Taikyu Series: Season finale with the BMW M4 GT4 at Okayama.The Okayama International Circuit (JPN) was the venue for the final  round of the 2021 Super Taikyu Series in mid-November. Among those in  action was Japanese BMW M Motorsport team SS/YZ Racing with Studie,  who competed in the #20 BMW M4 GT4. The car was again driven by  Tomohide Yamaguchi, Seiji Ara and Yuya Sakamoto (all JPN) at Okayama.  The trio ended the three-hour race in sixth place in the strong ST-Z class. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Road Atlanta, Spartanburg, Sebring: BMW Junior Team concludes US tour with a 24-hour race in the BMW M4 GT3.;BMW M Motorsport and the BMW Junior Team ended two eventful weeks in North America with the 24 Hours of Sebring. The schedule included a visit to BMW Team RLL at Petit Le Mans, a tour of the BMW Group plant in Spartanburg and then the test race with the new BMW M4 GT3 at Sebring. The race in the Creventic 24H Series served as the final test for the new car at one of the toughest circuits in the world.;Sebring. BMW M Motorsport and the BMW Junior Team ended two    eventful weeks in North America with the 24 Hours of Sebring (USA).    Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) started    with a visit to BMW Team RLL at Petit Le Mans, Road Atlanta (USA).    This was followed by a tour of the BMW Group plant in Spartanburg    (USA), a trip to see Verhagen’s family at their home, and then the    test race with the new BMW M4 GT3 at Sebring International Raceway,    where Hesse and Verhagen competed alongside US drivers Bill    Auberlen, Robby Foley and James Clay. The race in the Creventic 24H    Series served as the final test for the new car at one of the    toughest circuits in the world. BMW M Motorsport also used the    weekend to hand over the new BMW M4 GT3 from the test crew at BMW    Team RMG to the North American teams. BMW Junior Team on tour.For Harper, Hesse and Verhagen, the USA trip began at the season  finale of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, where they  accompanied the BMW works drivers and BMW Team RLL all weekend,  attended important meetings, and experienced the processes in a BMW M  Motorsports works programme at first hand. “We learned an awful lot in  the collaboration with BMW Team RLL and the BMW works drivers,” said  Hesse. “Plus, it was nice to be involved in the farewell race for the  BMW M8 GTE and sample the atmosphere at Road Atlanta.” This was followed by a trip to the largest BMW Group plant in the  world, in Spartanburg, where the BMW Junior Team gained first-hand  insights into the production of BMW X models. “As we are representing  BMW as drivers, it was cool for us to see how production works in the  largest plant in the world in Spartanburg,” said Verhagen. “It is  huge, and we only saw a small part of it. Hopefully, we will return  sometime and check out some other areas. It was really fascinating.” Harper, Hesse and Verhagen, together with their mentor Jochen  Neerpasch, who accompanied the BMW Junior Team throughout the entire  trip, then visited the BMW Car Club of America Foundation, which  possesses a fascinating exhibition of vintage BMW vehicles and other  BMW collectibles. A special wall drawing was dedicated to the  motorsport history of Jochen Neerpasch. The group saw out the evening  with a barbecue with Verhagen’s family, who live in Mooresville (USA)  near Spartanburg. For Neerpasch and the Juniors, the trip to the USA marked the end of  two years together. “So far, the guys have exceeded the expectations  we had of them at the start, which were pretty high anyway,” said  Neerpasch. “All that they are missing is experience. They are already  setting lap times like those of the top drivers. They need more race  outings, and they are sure to get them next season.” Harper was also positive in his appraisal of his time as a BMW Junior  so far: “We have come a long way since the first NLS race almost two  years ago. It is incredible how much we have learned in that time –  both as racing drivers and as people. Our training is hard, but it is  paying dividends. I think our results in the BMW M6 GT3 this season  have proved that.” BMW M4 GT3 test outing under race conditions at Sebring.Last weekend was all about the BMW M4 GT3 – not only for the BMW  Junior Team, but also for BMW M Motorsport. The 24 Hours of Sebring  was the final endurance test for the car, before it goes in search of  victories and titles from January 2022. When it does so, it will be in  the hands of private BMW M Motorsport teams, some of which are based  in North America. For this reason, BMW M Motorsport took the opportunity at Sebring to  hand over the BMW M4 GT3 from the test crew, BMW Team RMG, to the US  teams, who will run the car in the coming season. Engineers and  mechanics from BMW Teams RMG and RLL worked together for the outing at  Sebring. The Turner Motorsport and BimmerWorld Racing teams were also  involved with drivers Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley and James Clay and  gained valuable experience with the new car. The joint learning began with tests during the week and peaked with  the 24-hour race at one of the toughest circuits in the world, with  countless bumps that really put the car through its paces. After two  repairs, following collisions, and some minor issues during the race,  the BMW M4 GT3 crossed the finish line after 457 laps. Hesse and  Verhagen were the two Juniors who took part in the race. Harper was  only involved in the tests, as he is classed as a Gold driver, of  which only one may be registered per team. The Gold driver for this  race was Auberlen. “The circuit is different to the ones we are  familiar with in Europe,” said Hesse, summing up the test under race  conditions. “Unfortunately, there were two incidents in the race,  which resulted in long repairs. Apart from that, the BMW M4 GT3 did  very well. Racing here was a valuable experience.” The American drivers drew a very positive conclusion. “The first  impression of the BMW M4 GT3 is that it looks fantastic,” said  Auberlen. “Then I drove it, and I can say that it is far better in  every area than the BMW M6 GT3. With a 24-hour race in Sebring, we put  the BMW M4 GT3 to the toughest test imaginable.” Foley said: “A fantastic car. You can immediately feel the two years  of development that have been invested in the BMW M4 GT3. The systems  in the interior, with which the driver works, are a big step forward  compared to the BMW M6 GT3. The car is very user-friendly.” This was backed up by Clay, who was driving a GT3 race car for the  first time in Sebring: “Given that the BMW M4 GT3 is far faster than  the GT4 cars I have driven previously, I found it very easy to adapt  to the car, as the car is very well thought out and easy to operate. I  was able to focus fully on the driving.” The BMW M4 GT3 will contest its first race in the hands of BMW M  Motorsport teams in January 2022, at the 24 Hours of Dubai (UAE). This  will be followed by the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) at the end of the  month. The detailed race programme for the BMW Junior Team will be  announced at a later date. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW announces five-year agreement with the PGA TOUR and Western Golf Association to remain title sponsor of the BMW Championship.;BMW, the Western Golf Association (WGA) and the PGA TOUR today signed a five-year extension of their long and successful partnership. BMW will remain title sponsor of the BMW Championship, which has been named PGA TOUR Tournament of the Year on four occasions since it was first held in 2007, until 2027. ;Woodcliff Lake/Munich. BMW, the Western Golf Association (WGA)    and the PGA TOUR today signed a five-year extension of their long    and successful partnership. BMW will remain title sponsor of the BMW    Championship, which has been named PGA TOUR Tournament of the Year    on four occasions since it was first held in 2007, until 2027. The BMW Championship will continue as the penultimate tournament in  the PGA TOUR’s FedExCup Playoffs, featuring 70 of the world’s best  players competing for the 30 places at the season-ending TOUR  Championship. Before BMW came on board as title sponsor, the  tournament was known as the Western Open and was first held in 1899,  making it one of the longest-running events on the PGA TOUR.“For the past 15 years, we have worked with our partners at the PGA  TOUR and the Western Golf Association to host the top 70 players in  the world at what has become one of the best, and most exciting events  on the golf calendar,” said Sebastian Mackensen, president and CEO,  BMW of North America. “The BMW Championship is not only a great way to  showcase our brand and engage customers, but also a wonderful  opportunity to raise money for the Evans Scholars Foundation and help  so many young students to follow their dreams.”Each year, proceeds from the BMW Championship benefit the Evans  Scholars Foundation, which provides full tuition and housing  scholarships for hard-working young caddies. Over the past 15 years,  the BMW Championship has raised more than $40 million on behalf of the  Evans Scholars Foundation and has helped send more than 3,000 students  to college. This academic year, a record 1,070 caddies are attending  21 major colleges and universities on Evans Scholarships.“Since 2007, BMW has been our valued partner and a steadfast  supporter of both our championships and the Evans Scholars  Foundation,” said John Kaczkowski, WGA president and CEO. “As title  sponsor, BMW has fully embraced our mission, helping us transform the  Evans Scholars Foundation into a truly national program. We’re excited  and grateful for the opportunity to continue working together to  change the lives of youth caddies nationwide.”PGA TOUR commissioner Jay Monahan added: “We would like to express  our sincere thanks to BMW for their continued support of the PGA TOUR  and the Western Golf Association through 2027. The BMW Championship  played an incredibly impactful role in launching the FedExCup in 2007  and BMW’s commitment to presenting a best-in-class event each year  continues to elevate the FedExCup Playoffs.”By extending its role as the title sponsor of the BMW Championship,  BMW also strengthens its worldwide commitment to the sport of golf.  This year, the company was Worldwide Partner of the Ryder Cup for the  first time, and BMW will continue in this role when Marco Simone Golf  & Country Club (Rome, Italy) hosts the Ryder Cup in 2023. The  premium automobile manufacturer will also continue to organise the BMW  International Open in Munich (Germany), and remains title sponsor of  the BMW PGA Championship in London (England) and the BMW Ladies  Championship in Busan (South Korea).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW SIM Racing crowns its champions and presents innovative new features at the end-of-season finale.;BMW SIM Racing broadcast the third edition of BMW SIM Live on Saturday and Sunday live from BMW Welt in Munich (GER). This was the end of the season grand sim racing finale at the event which celebrated its debut back in 2019. ;Munich. BMW SIM Racing broadcast the third edition of BMW SIM    Live on Saturday and Sunday live from BMW Welt in Munich (GER). This    was the end of the season grand sim racing finale at the event which    celebrated its debut back in 2019. For the first time, the final    races in the BMW SIM Cups were held on the three major simulation    platforms, iRacing, rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa Competizione. The    titles went to Joshua Rogers (AUS, BMW SIM GT Cup, iRacing), Erhan    Jajovski (MKD, BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup, rFactor 2) and Nils Naujoks    (GER, BMW SIM Time Attack, Assetto Corsa Competizione). A total    prize purse of approaching 90,000 euros was up for grabs at the    weekend, however the focus of the two shows was also on the 2022 BMW    SIM Racing season and some fascinating technological innovations –    including an all-new motion platform in collaboration with D-BOX and    RaceX, as well as an entry-level steering wheel devised with Fanatec. “Twice is a repeat, three times is tradition,” said Pia Schörner, BMW  Group Head of Gaming and Sponsoring. “That is exactly what we wanted  to achieve when we started to get involved in the sim racing and  Esports community. We want to be a long-term and reliable partner –  and that is what we are. Events like BMW SIM Live are a key element in  this. Congratulations to all the winners of the BMW SIM Cup finals!” BMW SIM CUP FINALS.On Saturday, the opening evening of BMW SIM Live was all about the  finals of the BMW SIM Time Attack on Assetto Corsa Competizione and  the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup on rFactor 2. Both races were showdowns  between the twelve drivers who had qualified for the final over the  course of the season. On Sunday evening, the sim racing elite crowned  its champion in the BMW SIM GT Cup on the iRacing platform. 23 drivers  battled it out for victory in two races – first in the virtual BMW M8  GTE and then the BMW M4 GT3. The trophies for all three BMW SIM Cup  champions were designed by BMW Group Designworks and made from  sustainable materials, in line with the ‘circular design’ approach. At  the BMW Group, this is based on the four principles: RE:THINK,  RE:DUCE, RE:USE and RE:CYCLE. BMW SIM Time Attack.Nils Naujoks was the winner after 20 minutes of racing in the BMW M4  GT4 on the digital Silverstone circuit, being awarded prize money of  8,000 euros. Second place and 4,000 euros went to Daniel Savini (ITA),  with third place and 2,000 Euros to Tobias Pfeffer (GER). Nils Naujoks said: “This was the reward for all the hard work in the  week preparing for this race. I really feel at home at Assetto Corsa  Competizione. It was a bit hectic for me in qualifying and also before  the start but the race itself went very well.” BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup.Thirteen rivals competed against each other in the BMW M2 CS Racing  on the virtual Spa-Francorchamps circuit. Erhan Jajovski was the  winner after a dramatic battle that lasted to the final corner. With  this victory, he successfully defended last year’s title and secured  prize money of 6,000 euros. Marcell Csincszik (HUN) had to admit  defeat by only a narrow margin, but by finishing second was rewarded  with prize money of 3,000 euros. Third place and 1,500 Euros went to  Jiri Toman (CZE). Erhan Jajovski said: “It has always been very close between Marcell  and me this season and that was also the case in this final race. I  was surprised that he did not attack me earlier in the race as we  always were very close behind each other. In the end I was lucky, I  think. I very well defended the inside line in the final corner and am  very happy about my victory.” BMW SIM GT Cup.Coming from P5 on the grid after the first race of the evening with  the BMW M8 GTE on the Sebring International Raceway, which determined  the starting positions for the Main Race at the virtual Red Bull Ring,  defending champion Joshua Rogers stormed through the high-class field  with his BMW M4 GT3 and took the win as well as 25,000 US Dollars of  prize money. P2 went to his Coanda Simsport teammate Charlie Collins  (GBR), who will receive a 15,000-US dollar cheque for his success.  Team Redline driver Diogo Pinto (POR) finished third to gain 7,500 US Dollars. Joshua Rogers said: “I was very nervous before the race, especially  because our starting position wasn’t ideal. For me coming in for my  pitstop early made sense in order to stay out of trouble and get some  clean air afterwards. This undercut worked in the end. I pushed really  hard until I could see that my strategy would play out, as soon as the  others came in for their pitstops. Then a gained a lot more confidence.” -- BMW SIM TECHNOLOGY: BMW HAPTIC PLATFORM AND FANATEC CSL    STEERING WHEEL BMW.The big technological innovation for the coming season is the BMW  haptic platform, which BMW SIM Racing has developed in collaboration  with D-BOX and RaceX. Exclusive know-how from BMW Motorsport’s  professional racing simulator is incorporated in the moving platform  for sim rigs. BMW SIM technology motion cueing, in particular, takes  the quality of the BMW haptic platform to a new level. ‘Motion cueing’  is a translation of the driving dynamic values arising from the  simulation environment into ‘cues’ – transformed stimuli that provide  the driver, as precisely and realistically as possible, with  information on what the virtual car is doing at that moment,” said  Rudolf Dittrich, Head of BMW SIM Technology. “In short, the better the  motion cueing, the more realistically the sim racer feels the  movements of the haptic platform. This not only hugely improves the  driving experience – the so-called immersion – but also helps to drive  the vehicle at the limit and to develop the vehicle set-up more accurately.” Sébastien Mailhot, CEO of D-BOX Technologies Inc., said: “D-BOX  prides itself in creating the world’s only high-fidelity haptic  feedback experience worthy of the FIA's official stamp of approval.  Combined with BMW's unparalleled attention to details and knowledge,  we have been able to tinker with the feedback even more precisely,  which allowed us to craft the most accurate sim racing experience,  rivaling what only multi-million dollar simulators are capable of  doing today.” Richard Schouteren, CEO of SIM-LAB B.V., added: “We are proud that  BMW has chosen our RaceX branded frame as basis for this new motion  platform. Our long-lasting partnership with D-BOX injected with the  professional BMW sports simulation software make this an unprecedented  ride for the e-racing community.” As well as the BMW haptic platform, BMW SIM Racing has also been  involved in another hardware project. In conjunction with Fanatec,  they have come up with an entry-level sim racing steering wheel that  offers newcomers to the sport the highest possible quality at an  attractive price of 139.95 euros. The steering wheel is called the  Fanatec CSL Steering Wheel BMW and is available in the Fanatec online  shop now. This product once more pays testament to the BMW SIM Racing  principle to not only support and promote top-level sim racing, but  also to give any digitally interested racing enthusiast the  opportunity to experience this Esports discipline. -- BMW SIM RACING NEWS.As at the first two events, BMW Esports again used BMW SIM Live to  introduce its programme for the coming season, present news about  BMW’s sim racing project, and inspire with technological innovations. Cups, teams and cars.In 2022, victories and titles are again at stake in the BMW SIM GT  Cup and BMW SIM Time Attack. The BMW M4 GT3 is the only car in the BMW  SIM GT Cup on iRacing. The BMW SIM Time Attack on Assetto Corsa  Competizione features the full range of virtual BMW M Motorsport cars  – from the BMW M2 CS Racing and the BMW M4 GT4 to the BMW M4 GT3. New  to the programme is the BMW SIM Trophy, in which drivers from all over  the world can win trophies in different cars and on different  platforms, which are then presented at BMW SIM Live 2022. BMW Team Redline, BMW Team BS+COMPETITION and BMW Team G2 Esports  will line up as BMW SIM Racing teams at the major events on various  platforms in 2022. The virtual BMW M4 GT3, which was a big success on iRacing in 2021,  will also be available on Assetto Corsa Competizione from 24th  November and in the mobile game Real Racing 3 in 2022. There will be a  completely new car on rFactor 2 in 2022, the BMW Formula Pro. BMW is  the first manufacturer to present an initial concept for a special car  design for this virtual championship. The free areas of the BMW  Formula Pro car were designed by BMW Group Designworks. “In the  virtual world, designers have the freedom to present things that were  physically impossible up to now,” said Michael Scully, Global  Automotive Director at BMW Group Designworks, describing the appeal of  this task.  About BMW Esports.BMW has been collaborating with five of the world’s best teams as a  partner in the classic League of Legends game since 2020. Cloud 9,  FNATIC, FunPlus Phoenix, G2 Esports and T1 fly the BMW colours in the  biggest events in the industry. The highlight of the first  collaborative season in 2020 was the Worlds, in which G2 esports and  FNATIC made it to the knock-out stage of the finals in the battle of  the world’s best teams. G2 Esports even made it to the semi-final. The  Dota 2 specialists OG Esports are a new addition to the ‘United in  Rivalry’ squad as of 2021. The involvement in Esports gives BMW  completely new touch points with a dynamic, rapidly growing community;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Podium for Michael van der Mark and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team at season finale in Indonesia.;Strong performance at the finale in Indonesia: the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Michael van der Mark (NED) have rounded off the 2021 season in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) with a podium finish. The Dutchman rode his BMW M 1000 RR to third place in a rainy second race on Sunday.;Mandalika. Strong performance at the finale in Indonesia: the    BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Michael van der Mark (NED) have    rounded off the 2021 season in the FIM Superbike World Championship    (WorldSBK) with a podium finish. The Dutchman rode his BMW M 1000 RR    to third place in a rainy second race on Sunday. In the first race,    van der Mark had finished sixth in largely dry conditions. Tom Sykes    (GBR) completed the two races on the Mandalika International Street    Circuit in tenth and fifth positions. Heavy rainfall caused severe    schedule delays at the season finale. In the Superpole on Saturday morning, Sykes secured sixth spot on the  grid with van der Mark in ninth place on the third row. Extremely  heavy rainfall started just before the scheduled start of the first  race on Saturday afternoon and the conditions made it impossible for  any racing to take place on Saturday. The schedule was changed to  include two long races on Sunday. The start of race one on Sunday morning was delayed by 15 minutes due  to a rain shower. However, the riders were able to start on dry tyres.  Van der Mark fell back a little at the start but worked his way  forward to reach fifth place at the halfway point of the race. He then  dropped down one place in the closing phase, crossing the line in  sixth position. Sykes made a good start to move into fourth place and  was briefly in third. From lap two onwards, he maintained his position  in fifth before falling back in the second half of the race to cross  the finish line in tenth position. As had happened on the previous day, the rain arrived just as the  second race was about to begin on Sunday afternoon. The start was  delayed by more than one and a half hours and the race was shortened  to twelve laps. Van der Mark immediately moved up into the top 5 and  was involved in a thrilling duel for third place on the wet circuit  with new world champion Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR / Yamaha). Van der  Mark prevailed in this battle, claiming another podium finish to round  off the season. It was a strong end to a weekend during which van der  Mark had struggled with gastrointestinal problems. Sykes fell back a  little at the start but was back in fifth place after a few laps. He  crossed the finish line in this position. The races in Mandalika were the last in which Sykes and BMW Motorrad  Motorsport competed together, marking the end of three years of  working together. From 2019 to 2021, Sykes competed in 90 races for  the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, claiming six podium finishes and three  pole positions. “After having the pleasure to experience such successes together in  the past years, I would like to thank Tom on behalf of BMW Motorrad”,  said Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad. “I remember when we  announced our reborn World Superbike project together at EICMA 2018  and started a great journey. Beginning with the S and implementing the  M RR, we are very thankful for his contribution to the development of  the bike. Podiums and several pole positions have underpinned his effort.” Quotes after the Mandalika season finale. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “That  was a very moving weekend. It was a bit of a tricky start as Mickey  was pretty ill. He was very weak, so we reduced the number of laps for  him in the practice session to give him a break. It was also an  emotional weekend, as it was the final weekend with Tom on the BMW.  Then we had that Saturday, when extreme weather conditions prevented  the race from taking place. Absolutely torrential rain made racing  impossible but it did give Mickey some more time to recover. Both  riders did a good job in qualifying, with Tom in sixth and Mickey  ninth on the grid, which gave us a really good starting position for  the races. Mickey was able to convert that really well into sixth  place in the first race, although he was struggling with fitness at  the end of the race. He may otherwise have been able to do a bit  better. Tom had problems with his front tyres and then fell back to  tenth position. That was also not so satisfying for him. However, the  result in race two was really excellent. It was great to round off the  season with a podium for Mickey and a really good fifth place for Tom.  It’s lovely for him to get that result in his final race for our team  and I would like to thank him again for all the work he has  contributed to this project and the successes he has recorded for us.  I wish him all the best for the future. I would also like to  congratulate Pata Yamaha and Toprak on winning the title – respect. It  was wonderful to be here at the Mandalika International Street Circuit  on Lombok. We got a great reception here, from BMW Indonesia too, and  the atmosphere is phenomenal. Races like this definitely belong in the  world championship. Overall, that was certainly a satisfying season  for us. Compared to last year, we have taken a big step forward.  Mickey needed a bit of time to get a really good feel for the BMW, but  he produced some great races towards the end of the season. He  improved continually in qualifying too. We made regular modifications  to the motorbike as it was the first year with the BMW M 1000 RR for  us too. Results improved towards the end of the year and we were able  to close the gap to the leaders in the races as well. It is definitely  a positive trend and we are aiming to continue in this direction next  year. I am confident that we can then take the next step.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “I think Tom did a really good job. He has come back from a a  nine-week lay-off and it was also his farewell ride on the BMW M 1000  RR. So a lot of emotions for Tom. He handled it superbly well,  professional as he is. He went out there, qualified well in sixth  position and to end up with fifth in the final race is testament of  his quality. Mickey has not been feeling well all weekend and he  started really slowly with very limited laps. In one respect I think  the rain has probably helped his performance this weekend because of  his physical strength but, after a delayed start, he had a strong race  one and an even stronger race two. He just proved that he is still a  force in the wet and we are looking forward to get the opportunitiy to  get these podiums also in the dry conditions. So, great job by Mickey  and the whole team to finish off with a podium. In the 2021 season, we  had our ups and downs. Of course the biggest down of the year was  Tom’s serious crash. It has been quite a problematic year for us in  the sense that it started so late in a very compressed series and then  two fly-aways at the very end that came very late. But overall it has  not been too bad. We’ve had a win and some podiums and I like to look  at the positives, and the fact that Mickey is 20-something points off  being fourth in the championship. I think that should really be  applauded because for his first year on the bike that’s fantastic. We  know he can only get better so maybe he can be in the top-3 next year.  So that’s the positive for me. I want to thank Tom for his efforts, he  has been a great team member. Right from the end of 2018 when we  signed him he was a pillar of the team, he got the initial results and  drove the team into the right direction with his experience. We hope  that he can get his chance again in WorldSBK and prove his credentials  and, whatever he does, we wish him well. He will always be part of  this success and this chapter of the WorldSBK project.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Race one this morning was quite fun. At the start, it was a  bit wet here and there and this track has quite a lot of grip with  slicks in the wet patches. So I was enjoying the first part of the  race and thought I could be battling for the front but then it started  to dry pretty quick. I was battling for fifth, fourth position,  feeling good and my pace was okay but I was still not feeling well. At  the end of the race I was frustrated because I ran out of energy and I  lost another position. I was really angry about that but I had to deal  with it. Then race two unfortunately was postponed but it was the  right decision. When we went racing, the track was fully wet and it  was still raining a little bit. I knew that the track would have a lot  of grip and these 12 laps I think were long enough. I had a good start  and okay first laps. It was so much fun and at a certain point I was  battling with Toprak. We had some really nice battles on track, it  went back and forward and I really enjoyed it. To finish the season  with third place is incredible, it is always nice to finish the season  on the podium and especially knowing we had so much fun. I think the  season has been quite good but we want to make steps forward this  winter to be able to fight for the podium more often and also in the dry.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was  fantastic to finally get back in the racing arena. Honestly, after the  accident that I had and the break of nine weeks to come back here to  competition I think was a tall ask and working with the guys is always  a pleasure. I got settled in right away on the circuit in Mandalika.  They have done a fantastic job, so to come here to this great track at  this venue at this part of the world is already a pleasure and, as the  weekend progressed, to qualify on the second row was already quite  good, I think. Into race one, we got a good start and we were at the  back of the leading bunch but just couldn’t manage that with some  limitations I had with the package so I unfortunately dropped back and  then made some mistakes myself. But regarding race two, fantastic. The  surface is great in the wet conditions. There was another delay but  there was great support from the crowd in the grandstand and finally  we were able to get another race in front of those guys. I think it  was a great race from a spectacle point of view. I enjoyed the racing  and the grip the track offered in the wet. In general, the 2021 season  was bitter-sweet for obvious reasons. At the start, we were not quite  where we needed to be in terms of development and we had some issues,  but I still was the strongest BMW rider. Donington was great for me,  Mickey and BMW. This was probably the highlight of the season.  Development was always difficult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Group Plant Spartanburg to Expand Plant Logistics Operations; Includes a $100 Million Investment in a New One Million Square Foot Facility  Training center to be completed in summer 2022  More than 11.4 billion US dollars total investment in the site since 1992 ; Includes a $100 Million Investment in a New One Million Square  Foot Facility  Training center to be completed in summer 2022   More than 11.4 billion US dollars total investment in the site since  1992  Spartanburg, S.C.  BMW Manufacturing announced that  it will expand its logistics operations to a new building . Total  investment in the new building is approximately $100 million. When  completed, the new logistics center will be nearly one million square  feet in size with an opportunity for future expansion. “For nearly three decades, BMW has called South Carolina its second  home. This expansion in our logistics operation represents our  continued commitment to this state, and it will prepare Plant  Spartanburg for the future,” said Dr. Robert Engelhorn, president and  CEO of BMW Manufacturing. “The new warehouse will allow us to  consolidate our logistics processes as well as implement efficiency  measures for a more sustainable logistics operation.”  When the new logistics center opens in the middle of 2022, it will  allow BMW to consolidate two offsite warehouse operations – one for  returnable containers and another for body shop parts – into one  efficient onsite location. Inside the warehouse, shipments from  suppliers will be sorted, then delivered to their respective Plant  Spartanburg technologies. The result is a faster, leaner, more  efficient supply chain. To minimize the impact of truck traffic in the area and allow for  easy access to BMW, two private bridges will be constructed to connect  the logistics center to the BMW campus. Update on New BMW Training CenterConstruction is well underway on the new $20 million, 67,000 square  foot training center on the BMW campus, which was announced in  February. When completed in the summer of 2022, the building will  feature multiple classrooms for both professional development and  technical training, an outdoor amphitheater, and a unique concept of  outdoor meeting and workspace that includes wireless capabilities. The  training center will also be home to BMW’s well-known apprenticeship  program – BMW Scholars.  Since 1992, the BMW Group has invested more than $11.4 billion in its  South Carolina factory. BMW Group Plant Spartanburg is the largest BMW  Group plant in the world, producing more than 1,500 vehicles each day.  The plant exports more than two-thirds of its models to 125 global  markets. For seven consecutive years, it has been the largest exporter  by value in the United States. The model portfolio includes five  top-selling BMW X models, four Motorsport X models, and two plug-in  hybrid electric X models. The factory has a production capacity of up  to 450,000 vehicles and employs more than 11,000 people. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The MINI Cooper - the synonym for driving fun for over 60 years.;A glance at history makes it clear why the names of the traditional British brand and the legendary sports car engineer are often mentioned in the same context.;"Munich. For automotive fans with manual skills, the  premises in the London suburb of Surbiton must have been a paradise.  Scrap metal everywhere, car parts, tyres and a dedicated father  screwing on cars and bikes in a garage. And in the middle of it, a  certain John Cooper, who created the basis for an extraordinary career  as an engineer of racing cars right there immediately after the end of  the Second World War. To this day, his name is not only associated  with great successes in Formula One, but also with the particularly  sporty models of the MINI brand. It was thanks to John Cooper's  commitment that a more powerful model variant of the revolutionary  small car came onto the market just two years after the classic Mini  was introduced in 1959. The Mini Cooper immediately impressed with its  spirited power delivery and high agility. Even 60 years later, the  names of the tradition-steeped British car manufacturer and the  legendary sports car engineer are remarkably often mentioned in the  same context when it comes to maximum driving fun with minimal  external dimensions.The basis for this connection is the truly authentic sporting spirit.  In Great Britain, the desire to race reawakened soon after the end of  the war. All over the country, tracks were marked out and competitions  held. John Cooper had the talent and ambition to make his mark on this  scene. He was just 23 years old when he and his father Charles founded  the Cooper Car Company in 1946, which soon developed and built  successful Formula 3 and Formula 2 racing cars. The son's inventive  spirit culminated in the construction of a new type of Formula 1  racing car in which the engine did not work in front of the driver, as  was customary at the time, but behind him. Cooper celebrated his first  victories with it in 1958. In 1959 and 1960, Jack Brabham even became  world champion on Cooper. And the revolutionary mid-engine principle  established itself permanently in Grand Prix racing. Cooper's team  remained active in Formula 1 until the end of the 1960s. Among the  most famous pilots, besides Jack Brabham, were Sir Stirling Moss,  Bruce McLaren and Jochen Rindt.While his groundbreaking Formula 1 racing cars have long been  history, John Cooper's influence on the sporting driving experience in  production vehicles lives on until today. In this field, too, it all  began with a revolutionary design. While John Cooper was busy making  his mark on formula racing, engineer Alec Issigonis had developed a  new small car for the British Motor Corporation. With an exterior  length of just over three metres, the classic Mini offered an  astonishing amount of space for four passengers and their luggage.  Issigonis had arranged the engine transversely at the front, with the  gearbox directly below. Wheels positioned far out and short overhangs  did the rest. With its transversely positioned four-cylinder engine  and front-wheel drive, the classic Mini provided the basis for a  design for small and compact cars that was completely new at the time  and is still in use today.The classic Mini started with an engine output of 34 hp, but it was  light and exhibited strikingly agile cornering performance thanks to  front-wheel drive, a wide track and a torsionally rigid body. While  Issigonis primarily had a low-priced and economical vehicle for  everyone in mind, John Cooper immediately recognised the sporting  potential of the classic Mini. The two ingenious engineers had already  met during joint racing activities, later also cultivated business  relations and developed an intimate friendship over time.  Nevertheless, it took a lot of persuasion to raise the sporting  temperament of the classic Mini. With the blessing of the BMC  management, John Cooper therefore initially had a small series of  1,000 vehicles built, whose modified engine, expanded in displacement  to just under 1.0 litres, generated 55 hp, which was enough for a top  speed of 135 km/h. Cooper also provided a closer-ratio gearbox, a  better-guided gear lever, disc brakes on the front wheels and wider  tyres. In addition, the roof was colour-contrasted and the interior  was two-tone. Thus, the first Mini Cooper came onto the market in  September 1961.The reactions were euphoric and left only one wish unfulfilled: even  more power. Cooper and Issigonis, who had become convinced of the  sporting talent of the classic Mini, increased the engine capacity to  1071 cubic centimetres. This increased the output to 70 hp. The  chassis technology provided another important boost for the classic  Mini's sporting career: Issigonis had also broken new ground in the  areas of steering and wheel suspension, thus laying the foundation for  the go-kart feeling that is still famous today. Homokinetic universal  joints reduced the influence of the drive on the steering, a subframe  to which the rear wheels were also attached improved directional  stability, a rubber suspension and small telescopic shock absorbers  ensured fine response and progressive spring action.The Mini Cooper was immediately successful on racetracks and rally  tracks. It became a legend with its appearances at the Monte Carlo  Rally. In 1963, the Finn Rauno Aaltonen achieved the first class  victory. In addition to trophies, the Mini Cooper gained more and more  popularity year after year during its appearances. Its success in  competition with numerous much larger and more powerful rivals made it  a favourite with the public. The acclaimed highlights were the overall  victories achieved with the Mini Cooper S at the Monte Carlo Rally in  1964, 1965 and 1967. Only then did the rally career of the classic  Mini draw to a close.On the road, the Mini Cooper thrilled its fans from 1961 to 1971,  during which time its model designation became synonymous with  passionate driving fun. The name John Cooper remained consistently  present among fans of the classic Mini. The tuning kits developed by  Cooper for Mini production vehicles met with great demand in the 1970s  and 1980s. In 1990, the Mini Cooper returned to the model range. The  1.3-litre four-cylinder engine with initially 61 hp now worked under  the short bonnet. Thus, fans once again conquered the hairpin bends  and serpentines of this world with an agile and sporty Mini Cooper.  This version with 63 hp was built until autumn 2000. The successor was  already ready for take-off at that time.The takeover of the Rover Group by BMW at the beginning of 1994  opened up completely new perspectives for the MINI brand. At the  International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt in 1997, the study of a  MINI Cooper was presented, which offered the prospect of a new edition  of the unique British small car. As a modern interpretation of the  traditional vehicle concept, it combined the classic values of its  predecessor with the requirements of a modern automobile on the  threshold of the 21st century. Thus, in 2001, the new MINI saw the  streetlight of the world.The new MINI was bigger, chicer, more colourful and, of course,  technically up to date. And it also transferred the typical go-kart  feeling of the classic Mini into the modern era. At the same time, the  MINI produced in Oxford, England, presented itself as the first  premium vehicle in the small car segment. Unlike the classic one, the  MINI Cooper was now immediately part of the starting line-up. With a  maximum output of 85 kW/115 hp, it lived up to its name. Engine and  chassis design immediately formed a harmonious alliance for maximum  driving pleasure. The four-cylinder engine, once again mounted  transversely at the front, now had a displacement of 1.6 litres. Its  power enabled the MINI Cooper to sprint from standstill to 100 km/h in  9.2 seconds and to reach a top speed of 197 km/h. The high-quality  chassis technology of the MINI Cooper included McPherson struts on the  front axle, axle shafts of equal length and a multi-link rear axle  unique in the small car segment, disc brakes on all four wheels as  well as the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) driving stability system.The desire for even more power was also fulfilled with the modern  MINI. The 120 kW/163 hp MINI Cooper S followed as early as autumn 2001.In November 2006, the new edition of the modern MINI was launched  with an evolutionary design development and a fundamental technical  overhaul. ""From the Original to the Original"", the MINI's  visual appearance, which has received the highest marks of approval,  was refined in numerous details, which in particular emphasised the  sporting virtues of the compact curve artist even more clearly. The  MINI Cooper with 88 kW/120 hp and the MINI Cooper S with 128 kW/175  hp, which were available at the time of their market launch,  immediately impressed with their enhanced performance and  significantly reduced fuel consumption and emissions. Two years later,  the sporty characteristics of a Mini Cooper could also be experienced  for the first time with a highly efficient diesel engine. In the MINI  Cooper D, 81 kW/110 hp, and in the Mini Cooper SD, which was  introduced shortly afterwards, 125 kW/170 hp provided a powerful drive.When developing the modern MINI around the turn of the millennium,  Mike Cooper had already brought the know-how gathered in his family  into the project. John Cooper's son was passionately committed to  particularly sporty versions of the MINI. In the following years, the  tradition-steeped connection became even closer. At the beginning of  2007, the BMW Group acquired the brand rights of John Cooper Garages.  As a result of this arrangement, the John Cooper Works brand has been  an official part of the MINI brand since 2008.

After two Rolex 24 victories in Daytona (USA)    and five IMSA series class wins, the farewell race of the MOTUL BMW    M8 GTE added the 26th podium finish and a pole position    to the history books. At Petit Le Mans, the final race of the season    in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Road Atlanta    (USA), Jesse Krohn (FIN) put the #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE on pole    position in class and led the field into the last race of the GTLM    era. The race proved to be tougher than qualifying but shortly    before the end of the ten hours, Krohn and his BMW Team RLL    colleagues John Edwards (USA) and Augusto Farfus (BRA) took over P3    and could step on the GTLM podium one final time. The #25 sister car    and the Turner Motorsport BMW M6 GT3 had to retire due to race incidents. On a special weekend for BMW M Motorsport, BMW of North America and  the IMSA series, the MOTUL BMW M8 GTE took its final bow from racing  as a pole-sitter and podium finisher. After a dominant performance by  Krohn in qualifying on Friday that was awarded with pole position in  GTLM class, both cars struggled to match their oppenents’ pace in the  last ever GTLM contest. BMW Team RLL kept fighting until the end and  was awarded with a late promotion to P3 in the race. Farfus had the  honour of finishing the last stint of the last race for the BMW M8 GTE. The #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE made good progress from the P6 starting  position on the GTLM grid. Unfortunately, the car had to be retired  following an incident involving Connor De Phillippi (USA), leaving him  and his fellow drivers Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT)  disappointed. After the farewell of the BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL now  sets sights towards its future in GTD Pro with the BMW M4 GT3 in 2022  and in the LMDh class with the BMW M LMDh in 2023. Turner Motorsport had a disappointing final weekend of the IMSA  season with DNFs with the BMW M6 GT3 in GTD class as well as with both  BMW M4 GT4s in Friday’s IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge season finale. Special guests of BMW of North America at Petit Le Mans were Jochen  Neerpasch, founder of BMW Motorsport GmbH in 1972, and the current BMW  Junior Team drivers Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil  Verhagen (USA). Quotes after the MOTUL Petit Le Mans: Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “What a day!  Bidding farewell to the GTLM class, the BMW M8 GTE, the BMW M6 GT3,  added by a showrun with the BMW M4 GT3. Before that we confirmed BMW  Team RLL as our partner for the coming years in North America and  published first pictures as well as a name for our future BMW M LMDh  project. Thanks to everybody who put a lot of effort in the BMW M8  GTE. Podium and pole position in the final race are a nice conclusion.  Now we open a new chapter and look forward to the BMW M4 GT3, that  will do a test race next week in Sebring.” John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd  place): “It was a bit of a surprising podium at the end but  it is really nice to sign off the BMW M8 GTE with a successful weekend  – qualifying on pole and finishing on the podium. We desparately  wanted to win that one after last year’s heart break when we were  leading in the last hour before being pushed off the track. But it is  a positive end to the era of the M8. Now we are looking forward to the  BMW M4 GT3 and hopefully we can celebrate of the same success with  that car.” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE,    3rd place): “Obviously, we wanted to finish the  season and the BMW M8 GTE programme with a win but today it just  wasn’t in the cards. We did all that we could but the Porsches were  just too fast and the Corvettes as well so this was basically the  maximum result that we could achieve. I am super happy for the team  that we got this. Obviously we wanted to win but that didn’t happen today.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd  place): “I was pleased to do the final stint in the M8 GTE. I  think we have to be proud of ourselves, we did what we could. It was  the maximum we could achieve. We brought to the end the result that  was possible today. We close a chapter but it is a long book. The BMW  M4 GT3 is just around the corner and we can’t wait to be back.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE,  DNF): “A tough race today. We were a bit out of strategy  trying to make up for some of the deficit we had in the pits. We were  pushing as hard as we could. Before the incident there were a few  prototypes behind me. I thought, one of them would be right behind me,  but he went into the pits. I left a bit too much space in the last  corner, got on the marbles and went off. I was just a passenger at  that point. Of course it’s very disappointing to end the M8 program  for our car on that note. I feel bad for the guys.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the run-up to MOTUL Petit Le Mans, the season    finale of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Road    Atlanta (USA), BMW M Motorsport is providing updates on the LMDh    project for the 2023 season and its plans for the coming year. BMW    Team RLL, who have been celebrating successes with BMW M Motorsport    since 2009, will compete in the two LMDh prototypes as of 2023.    Initial sketches give a foretaste of the car, which will be called    BMW M LMDh. Alongside the LMDh test programme, BMW Team RLL will    field two BMW M4 GT3s in the new GTD Pro category in the 2022 IMSA season. “I’m delighted that our LMDh project has reached its next milestone  with the announcement of BMW Team RLL as the team to race in the two  prototypes,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “As with  chassis partner Dallara, in team principal Bobby Rahal and his crew we  have outstanding expertise and decades of experience at the highest  level on our side. The LMDh project continues to gain momentum and I  am confident that next year we will once again take all necessary  steps as planned to be as well prepared as possible for entering our  first IMSA season with the LMDh prototypes in 2023. We are taking on  this new challenge together at full speed.” Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport, added: “BMW Team RLL is the  ideal partner for our LMDh project. BMW M Motorsport has been working  very successfully with Bobby Rahal and his crew since 2009. During  this time, we have all come to know the IMSA series very well and have  celebrated major success together. From our perspective, racing in the  top class and challenging for overall victories from 2023 is the  logical next step. When you compete with a new race car, it is a great  advantage to already know what awaits you in the race series, at the  circuits, and in terms of organisation. This is 100 percent the case  in the constellation we have opted for. That also goes for BMW of  North America. Thank you very much for your fantastic support. Plus,  BMW Team RLL is not only one of the best teams in North America on the  GT scene, but also in Formula racing so we have all the right  ingredients for success.” BMW Team RLL has been contesting the GT category of the IMSA and its  predecessor series in BMW racing cars since 2009. This partnership’s  biggest successes have been the GTLM wins with the BMW M8 GTE at the  24 Hours of Daytona in 2019 and 2020, the GTLM title wins in the  driver, team and manufacturer standings of the 2020 Michelin Endurance  Cup, and a total of five GT titles with the BMW M3 GT in the 2010 and  2011 seasons of the American Le Mans Series. Bobby Rahal’s team also  enjoys success in the North American IndyCar Series. The team has won  the legendary Indy 500 twice – most recently in 2020. Alongside the  intensive testing with the BMW M LMDh, BMW Team RLL will contest the  2022 IMSA season starting with two BMW M4 GT3s in the newly  established GTD Pro category in the first races. “For me personally and professionally this is a dream come true”,  said Rahal. “Now to first run a brand-new car like the BMW M4 GT3 and  after that make the next step with BMW Team RLL to race for overall  wins in the LMDh class is a direction we definitely wanted to go. I’m  so pleased, so proud, so thankful that we’ll be able to do it together  with BMW M Motorsport.” The design sketches of the BMW M LMDh were produced in close  collaboration between BMW M Motorsport and BMW Group Designworks.  Michael Scully, BMW Group Designworks Global Automotive Director,  said: “Uniting the iconic elements of BMW M Motorsport design DNA with  the performant architecture of an ultra-modern prototype is what this  project is all about. The shape of the BMW M LMDh exemplifies the  visceral efficiency which is so synonymous with BMW M Motorsport, yet  the design process has been highly collaborative between BMW M  Motorsport, Dallara, and BMW Group Designworks. Iterating the exterior  surfaces with this team is particularly rewarding because each project  partner has distinguished expertise in their discipline, yet there’s a  mutual respect and drive to find a transcendent, cohesive result  together.  I’m confident this car will be something we can all be  proud of, and that the on-track results will reflect the development  team’s great dynamic. For me personally this project represents the  synthesis of my professional design experience and a life-long  immersion in prototype racing at lower echelons as a driver. It’s  indeed a dream realized.”  Note to editors:A new episode of the video series “MBEDDED” will be released on the  BMW Motorsport YouTube channel, which will be all about the renewal of  the partnership with BMW Team RLL in the context of MOTUL Petit Le  Mans.

The new BMW M4 GT3, which will take to the track all over the  world as BMW M Motorsport’s new GT flagship from 2022, will be on  display in the Fan Zone at the racetrack during the weekend. Quotes ahead of the MOTUL Petit Le Mans: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “Our  racing programme with the BMW M8 GTE certainly was a great project for  us. Winning the 24 Hours of Daytona not once, but twice has to be the  highlight. And to be able to win it two years in a row is a tremendous  comment about the BMW M8 GTE. We’ve had a lot of really good races  with it. The M8 has been a fabulous car for us to race and it was  really well done in terms of the design of it to begin with which I  think is why it has been successful. All in all we have to look back  fondly at our program history with the BMW M8 GTE and would like to  end on a high note with victory at Petit Le Mans.”   John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “It’s been a long break for us since Watkins Glen, so  I’m itching to get back to racing! Last year’s Petit Le Mans proved  the BMW M8 GTE was quick at Road Atlanta, but we sadly watched the win  slip through our fingers in the last half hour after a prototype  shoved Augusto off. This year we have a little extra motivation to  take what was ours last year and end the final race for the BMW M8 GTE  with a win! The M8 has given us some great performances over the  years, but by far my most memorable race with the car will always be  the 2020 Rolex 24 at Daytona, specifically my triple stint Sunday  morning. The Porsches had proved to be quick in the night, but as the  track temp started rising with the sun shining on it, our M8 came  alive. I had a great battle with one of the Porsches, almost touching  at 180mph as we fought for the lead. It was the most mentally  exhausting stint I’ve driven in a race and the stakes were as high as  they could get! We pulled off the win that day to give the BMW M8 GTE  its second Daytona win in a row and proved that 2019 was no fluke. We  will miss the M8!” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “Road Atlanta has been a good place for us in the last  couple of years. We were really close to winning the race last year so  we know the car can do it as long as we execute a clean race. It will  be the last race for the BMW M8 GTE so I will try to enjoy every  moment of it, and it would be awesome to send the car to retirement  with one last win. It has been a privilege to have been a part of the  GTLM project with the BMW M8 GTE for the past four years with BMW Team  RLL and I have a lot of memories which I will cherish forever. The  most important being the win at the 2020 Daytona 24h and being the  driver bringing it home and passing the checkered flag after 24h of  close racing. The car is a beast, and I will for sure miss driving it.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “This will be a very emotional race for all of us as it  is the end of the BMW M8 GTE era. Of course, we would all like to  finish with the car as high on the podium as we can. Last year, we led  until the last few minutes, finishing third after getting pushed off  the circuit. Most importantly, I want to thank BMW for the opportunity  to race such a wonderful car in a great series.” Bruno Spengler (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE):  “Road Atlanta has suited the BMW M8 GTE in past races so hopefully we  will be in a position to fight for a good finish for the car’s final  race. In fact, my best memory of the car is winning the six-hour race  at the track with Connor in 2020. GTE has been a special category. The  cars are great to drive with super tyres and no ABS. It reminded me a  bit of a DTM car – with less downforce.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “Petit will be the final send off for our BMW M8 GTE  and I know she is ready to go out in style. We had two great test days  and the team came very close to winning the race last year. Road  Atlanta suits the car well and I know if we run a mistake free race,  we should have a shot to fight for a win one last time. The M8 program  will forever have a special place in my heart since it was my first  factory effort with BMW. The most memorable win together was  definitely the Rolex 24 at Daytona in 2019. It was a very emotional  win for not only BMW as a brand but also for myself with my family in  attendance to see such a pinnacle moment in my career. It has been  four fantastic years with highs and lows, but it has been some of the  most fun I’ve had in motorsport. I will miss the GTLM era greatly, but  I believe the future of our motorsport programmes is very bright.” Philipp Eng (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE):  “Petit Le Mans is one of my season highlights;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW M Motorsport News, 9th November 2021.;Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you a regular overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams.;ADAC GT4 Germany: Schrey/Piana win the title in the BMW M4 GT4.Michael Schrey (GER) and Gabriele Piana (ITA) did it. The Team Hofor  Racing by Bonk Motorsport duo won the drivers’ title in ADAC GT4  Germany. Schrey and Piana took a total of five season wins overall in  their BMW M4 GT4, with four of those coming in the first four races,  paving the way for the later title win. The two experienced drivers  ended the season with a lead of eleven points, despite suffering  setbacks at the final weekend, held at the Nürburgring (GER). After  retiring on Saturday after a pit stop error, they finished in P20 on  Sunday. On a drying track, the team followed the same tyre strategy as  their rivals in the overall standings and opted for wet-weather tyres.  This ultimately wrong decision saw both contenders for the title drop  right down the field. “The tyre choice was the best wrong decision I have ever made,” said  Schrey. “I still can’t believe it. After it being so close last year,  lots of people in the paddock are pleased for us that we won this  title. Gabriele is a very fast racing driver and uses his head. We  work together flawlessly as a team and trust each other 100 percent.  And Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport delivered another incredible  performance in 2021. It’s these factors that tipped the scales in  favour of us winning the championship. Now we are over the moon.” Piana added: “We knew that slicks would have been the right decision  but we wanted to be in the same position as the Zakspeed Mercedes-AMG  and play it safe. Now it is hard to put just how happy we are into  words. To finally win the title in the ADAC GT4 Germany after  finishing in second place two years in a row in 2019 and 2020 is fantastic.” Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport finished in second place in the team standings. ADAC GT Masters: Schubert Motorsport ends the season with two    top-ten results.Nick Yelloly (GBR) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) ended the ADAC GT Masters  season with two top-ten results in the BMW M6 GT3 fielded by Schubert  Motorsport. The duo moved up the field well in both races at the  Nürburgring (GER). On Saturday, they started from twelfth on the grid  and worked their way up into P9, and Yelloly and Krohn made up even  more ground on Sunday, starting from 18th on the grid and  crossing the finish line in P8. They finish the season in eighth place  in the overall standings, after three podium finishes. The highlight  being the second place at Schubert Motorsport’s home event in Oschersleben. Italian GT Championship: Endurance final at Monza.The racetrack in the royal park of Monza (ITA) hosted the finale of  the 2021 Italian GT Championship on the last weekend in October.  Another three-hour endurance race brought the season to a close. The  #7 BMW M6 GT3 of BMW Team Italia was shared by Stefano Comandini  (ITA), Marius Zug (GER) and Bruno Spengler (CAN) once again. The trio  finished the final endurance race of the year in fifth place. Their  team-mates Nicola Neri, Giuseppe Fascicolo (both ITA) and Alfred  Nilsson (SWE) secured another class win with the #215 BMW M4 GT4 in  the GT4 category, and also won the season’s standings in this class. Super GT Championship: BMW Team Studie in action at Motegi.The penultimate race weekend of the Japanese Super GT Championship  season was held at the Twin Ring Motegi (JPN). BMW Team Studie with  Seiji Ara and Tomohide Yamaguchi (both JPN) at the wheel of the BMW M6  GT3 finished in P15 in the GT300 category. The season finale will be  held at Fuji (JPN) on the last weekend in November, when BMW Team  Studie will have the honour of contesting the BMW M6 GT3’s final race  before it is replaced by the new BMW M4 GT3 next year. BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux: Stienes Longin crowned champion.The first BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux champion is Stienes Longin  (NED). The PK Carsport driver clinched the title at the season finale  at Assen (NED) at the end of October. Longin had already secured the  crown on the final Saturday after winning the first of the weekend’s  three races. His team-mate Peter Guelinckx (BEL) won the title in the  AM class. The duo shared the car in the third, longer race and ended  the season with another podium finish. The title in the Pro-Am  classification went to Steven Brams (BEL). 2021 marked the inaugural season of the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux.  Five race weekends were held in Belgium and the Netherlands between  May and October. Each event consisted of three races: two 30-minute  races and a 55-minute race with a mandatory pit stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Motorrad presents the next SoulFuel bike. ;"Unique, different and yet completely BMW R 18 - that’s ""The Wal"", the latest creation by Japanese customizer Shinya Kimura. ";"Munich. Unique, different and yet completely BMW R 18  - that’s""The Wal"", the latest creation by Japanese  customizer Shinya Kimura. After Roland Sands and Dirk Oehlerking,  Kimura is the third customizer to transform the R 18 into an  extraordinary unique specimen for the ""SoulFuel"" series.  ""SoulFuel"" is a collaboration between BMW Motorrad and  selected customizers.Until recently, Shinya Kimura worked mainly on older  motorcycles, but the Japanese customizer is increasingly also devoting  himself to projects involving modern bikes.""The Wal"" is one of them. “The basis is the R 18,  powered by the latest and greatest engine I have ever worked on. It  all started with a visit to the BMW Motorrad R 18 development team in  Germany. I got to know the unbounded passion and innovative power that  prevails at BMW Motorrad. Finally, in February 2021 in California, I  rode the standard R 18 for a few hundred kilometres to get to know the  character of the bike. Following a whole series of conversations, this  eventually led to my personal interpretation of the R 18, in which I  applied the entire range of my activities as a customizer,"" says  Shinya Kimura, recounting the initial phase of ""The Wal""  project.Kimura then began work in mid-February and ""The  Wal"" was already built up by the end of June. ""But there  were still some mechanical problems that kept me busy for another two  weeks,"" Kimura continues.Kimura’s motorcycles are created exclusively “hands-on”Shinya Kimura's craftsmanship can be aptly described by the term  ""hands-on"", as there are no sketches, drawings, blueprints  or mock-ups during the building process. But there is a precise idea  of what the customer, or in this case the customizer, wants.""I built the R 18 entirely for myself. When I rode the  production R 18, I thought it might suit my build and riding  preferences better if I designed it to be a little more front-facing  with a fairing. I decided to adopt the frame, wheels and tyres as well  as suspension elements and brakes because I didn't feel the need to  change them after I had ridden the bike. I also wanted to be able to  ride for long distances with my R 18 while feeling and enjoying the  legendary boxer engine. It was very important to me to preserve the  two characters of the R 18 as I experienced them when riding. Thanks  to its mighty engine, the bike is wild and has almost inexhaustible  power on the one hand, yet it is completely good-natured on the other.  Just like a whale, hence the German animal name for this R 18, which  for me is something like a ""Sports Endurancer"","" Kimura explains.The ""Sports Endurancer"" is unmistakably evident in  Kimura's R 18 ""The Wal"". This is ensured by a larger and,  completely differently designed fuel tank compared to the original, an  elongated, harmoniously rounded seat hump and a half-shell fairing.""I also moved the foot rests back about two inches to have  more flexibility for positioning the legs. At the same time, I lowered  the handlebars and changed the seat to my liking. The seat cushion was  also designed by me and then handmade by BACKDROP Leathers in Japan.  It all added up to the very natural posture that I like,"" Kimura continues.The semi-shell fairing houses two asymmetrically arranged  headlights that almost look like eyes and, with a little imagination,  actually give Kimura's R 18 the appearance of a whale together with a  ""set of teeth"" incorporated underneath. The colour scheme  and the coarsely textured paintwork also match the theme of ""The  Wal"". In short: ""The Wal"" R 18 is an “animal” of a  bike. Powerful, mighty, but always good-natured.""What I like best about my version of the R 18 is that I  was able to change the style and seating position to my liking without  destroying the excellent original functionality of the R 18. But  drastically changing the seating position and adding my own style and  taste was a big challenge in my interpretation of the BMW Heritage.  Besides, all these computerised systems and wiring were quite new to  me and I learned a lot,"" says Kimura, pleased with the result of  his work.Hard facts about the R 18 customising project ""The Wal"":The King of Customizing: Shinya Kimura.Born and raised in a family that ran a small rivet factory in  downtown Tokyo, Shinya Kimura was always surrounded by the smell of  steel and oil and the sound of machinery and metals. Perhaps that's  why, after studying entomology, Kimura decided to return to what felt  most natural to him: tinkering in his workshop and building things  from different metals.Kimura, the father of the so-called ""Zero Style""  motorbike, began his career as a customizer in Japan at Zero  Engineering, a company he founded in 1992. He rose to international  fame as early as the 1990s, when his custom Harley-Davidson  ""Samurai Chopper"" was created. It followed his  characteristic wabi-sabi influenced style.In search of new inspiration, Kimura later moved to Azusa,  California, where he founded his own independent company, Chabott  Engineering, in 2006. Today, the sought-after customizer only makes a  handful of motorcycles a year - exclusively for customers with whom he  feels a mutual understanding and no time pressure. The great passion  that drives him: ""Passion for all the motorbikes that were born  into this world"", as he says himself. While working on ""The  Wal"" project, he discovered new things every day that stimulated  and motivated him. Looking back, he says: ""I greatly appreciate  BMW Motorrad and all the people who supported me in this project. It  was such a valuable and impactful experience for me.""Disclaimer.The vehicles shown may be modified  and fitted with third-party accessories and/or proprietary parts that  are not manufactured, distributed or tested by BMW.

BMW Group at COP 26 UN Climate Summit in Glasgow: “No more waiting. No more clever tactics. It’s time to act. Now!”; Oliver Zipse gives keynote speech at Sustainable Innovation Forum  Holistic and effective approach to reducing CO2 emissions  Circular economy will be key ;Munich/Glasgow. It is a commitment born of tradition  and responsibility: The BMW Group has attended every UN climate summit  since 2008. At this year's COP 26 in Glasgow, the company once again  sees itself as a provider of innovative mobility solutions in the  fight against climate change. The BMW Group brought along the BMW i  Vision Circular, produced from 100% secondary materials, as a clear  statement of its ambitions. The company is also actively engaging in  dialogue with stakeholders and partners in Glasgow, discussing both  unresolved issues and a range of possible solutions. BMW Group as a partner of the Sustainable Innovation ForumThe BMW Group has been a partner of the Sustainable Innovation Forum  (SIF) since the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015. The SIF  is one of the most important economic forums within the COP framework,  bringing together representatives from the political sector, cities,  NGOs, the financial world and industry. For the first time, Chairman  of the Board of Management of BMW AG Oliver Zipse will give the  keynote speech for the three-day event in Glasgow this year, setting  clear priorities: “The key to sustainability lies in innovation: in  innovative technologies, but also in innovative thinking that accepts  no boundaries. Most importantly, together we must choose and follow a  binding path with clear goals. Always according to the motto: No more  waiting. No more clever tactics. It’s time to act. Now.” BMW Group commits to goal of total climate neutrality by 2050Every gram of CO2 counts – no matter where it is emitted. All  available technologies for reduction must be utilised. The BMW Group  has set itself a firm and verifiable interim goal for 2030 throughout  its entire value chain: to reduce CO2 emissions from its vehicles by  at least 40% – starting with the raw material, through the supply  chain, production and the use phase, all the way to recycling. Public  verifiability of this reduction takes place through the Integrated BMW  Group Report, which documents sustainable development indicators with  equal weighting as key business figures. The BMW Group is also a  member of the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) and signed the    “Business Ambition for 1.5°C” pledge ahead of COP 26. This  is an important step, in line with the most ambitious objective of the  Paris Climate Agreement and commits the company to the goal of total  climate neutrality by 2050. By 2030, over 50% of sales fully electric – MINI and    Rolls-Royce all-electric in ten yearsThe BMW Group released the first electric car produced in Germany on  a large scale, the BMW i3, back in 2013. By 2030, more than 50% of its  annual vehicle sales will be fully electric. Furthermore, its two  British brands, Rolls-Royce and MINI, will be exclusively all-electric  from the early 2030s onwards. In this connection, Oliver Zipse  underlined the importance of building infrastructure at the same time:  “Ramping up electromobility is the single most important factor on the  road to climate-neutral mobility. But even in industrialised  countries, there is still one major obstacle: the lack of infrastructure.” Circular economy: The purest form of Sheer Driving PleasureAnother focal point for the BMW Group is the circular economy: Humans  consume more than 100 billion tonnes of raw materials every year – and  that number is rising. In addition, processing of many primary raw  materials is extremely energy-intensive and therefore also  carbon-intensive. That is why the BMW Group is pursuing the vision of  a circular economy, with the aim of keeping raw materials in the cycle  for as long as possible. The BMW i Vision Circular is in Glasgow as  both an exhibit and to spark debate. It demonstrates in very tangible  form, how a vehicle can be produced using 100% secondary materials –  and where the challenges lie. BMW Group Dialogue 2021 – realising change together with partnersThe BMW Group already held a stakeholder dialogue on the subject of  the circular economy in Glasgow on 7 November. BMW Group vehicles  currently average around 30% secondary materials. Going forward, the  company aims to increase this amount to 50%. The BMW Group discussed  how this can be achieved and what hurdles need to be overcome with  around 25 high-level international stakeholders at its dialogue event.  Alongside the BMW Group’s Vice President Sustainability and Mobility,  Dr Thomas Becker, renowned Cradle-to-Cradle pioneer Prof. Michael  Braungart also served as a catalyst for discussion.  If you have any questions, please contact: Corporate Communications Andreas Klugescheid, Head Governmental Affairs Europe, Middle East  and AfricaEmail: andreas.klugescheid@bmw.de, Telephone: +49-89-382-23661 Marc Sauber, Spokesperson Sustainability CommunicationsEmail: marc.sauber@bmw.de,  Telephone: +49 89 382-52322 Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.com/deutschlandEmail: presse@bmwgroup.com  The BMW Group With its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Statement Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Conference Call Quarterly Statement to 30 September 2021;Statement Zipse Conference Call Q3 2021 ;A very warm welcome to all of you! The BMW Group is profitable and the company is growing. This is  thanks to our customers around the world as well as the strong demand  for our diverse range of products and drivetrain technologies. We delivered 1.9 million BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to  customers in the first nine months of the year as well as 156,000 BMW  motorcycles and scooters. This represents an increase of 18 and 21  percent respectively above the previous year. BMW once again gained  market share and captured 3.4 percent of the global market as a  premium manufacturer. We were also able to expand our strong competitive position in key  markets, such as the US and China. BMW leads the premium segment in  numerous countries. In addition to China and the US, this is also the  case in Mexico, Brazil and other markets in South America, as well as  South Africa and several European countries, including our domestic  market of Germany. This shows that: We are maintaining our successful business  development. And we can therefore confirm our adjusted guidance  for 2021. Our profitability is of extreme importance. In this way, we  are laying the foundation for continued investment in relevant future  areas of activity. This ambidexterity is needed now more than ever.  Just think about the ambitious political guidelines, diversified  economic and social developments around the world, new technological  possibilities and geopolitical tensions, and many other examples. As a global company, we have a responsibility to ensure the BMW  Group’s business model is viable in the long term under all possible  conditions. On the one hand, this means we have to approach short-term  changes in our environment with flexibility, but also with  consistency. At the same time, we continue to follow our strategic  direction in line with our long-term goals and are making the  necessary decisions. I would like to discuss these two perspectives in more detail today: Directly to the first point:This year, we demonstrated once again that we are capable of  overcoming difficult situations: This applies equally to the lingering  effects of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as to the current  situation with semiconductor supplies. Our Divisions Purchasing,  Development and Production as well as Sales and Marketing are working  together very closely on this and exhausting all possibilities. Our  stable and trustful relationships with suppliers worldwide also mean  that we have been able to cushion the impact for our customers better  than many of our competitors. Not only all our brands, but also all major regions of the world saw  significant growth until September: Europe: more than 10 percent.  Asia: almost 20 percent. The Americas: over 30 percent. Other markets  grew by almost 30 percent. As expected, and as previously announced, the sales momentum for our  electrified vehicles is particularly strong: Our deliveries of  electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids doubled between January and  September, compared to the previous year. Our BEV sales were even 120  percent higher year-on-year. Our new innovation flagships, the BMW i4 and BMW iX, have recently  begun rolling off the production line. Both are pre-ordered several  months out. Many members of the media and car experts from around the  world have already experienced the i4 and the iX for themselves and  they were thrilled. We on the Board of Management get to test our products on a regular  basis, of course. But recently, our senior managers had the same  opportunity. They drove almost 600 km in the iX, from Munich to just  outside Cologne – fully electric and with all the latest digital  features. Their conclusion: E-mobility has fully arrived in our  everyday lives. However, the charging infrastructure isn't keeping up. Here in  Germany and all across Europe, it needs to be expanded swiftly and  noticeably – while also being binding and ambitious. I am also  advocating for this as ACEA president. The growth of electric cars  already exceeds the growth of current charging capacity in Germany by  factor of five. Many EU countries still don’t have a charging network  at all. Without a coherent framework, no technology can be implemented  or become widely accepted. This applies to both e-mobility and  hydrogen. That is why the next steps towards tighter CO2  reductions in Europe after 2030 should only be decided based on the  charging infrastructure that has actually been built by then. A review  in 2028 can then define the right specifications for the rest of the journey. A fundamental requirement is that our customers are already  enthusiastic about e-drives today. And we can state that we are on the  right track here. To quote a recent headline: “The best 4 Series is  electric” – the new BMW i4 is getting a lot of praise like this. This  is how we create desirability. We are building the new i4 at our  oldest plant – where people of more than 50 nationalities work  together, right in the heart of the city. Please allow me a brief digression – because this is where the change  is most visible: We are gradually relocating our engine production to  other sites – without cutting jobs. Instead, an assembly plant for  electric cars is being built on the same site. That gets us moving  quickly: By 2023, at least half of all vehicles from Plant Munich will  have an electrified drive train – the overwhelming majority of them  fully electric. With its new vehicle assembly, the plant will also be  able to produce up to 100 percent BEVs from 2026 onwards. This will be  determined entirely by demand. That is how systematic transformation  works. At the same time, we are also working on emission-free  transport logistics for our main plant. No one will get left behind. We have already trained more than 50,000  specialists worldwide for e-mobility. Starting this month, the i4 and  iX will also be available alongside our electric pioneer, the BMW i3; we let our  actions speak for themselves. For the NEUE KLASSE, for example, we are  sourcing “green” steel – manufactured using hydrogen and green power –  from Swedish start up H2 Green Steel. In this way, we can drastically  reduce CO2 emissions starting at the very beginning of the  supply chain. The real question, after all, is: What is a vehicle’s overall carbon  footprint throughout its lifecycle – from the use of raw materials,  through industrial manufacturing and active use, all the way to recycling? The credibility of this is measured by whether concrete action can be  verified at the end. That is why the BMW Group became the first German  automotive manufacturer to join the Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees.  This entails a commitment to climate neutrality by 2050. Our path to achieving this is scientifically validated, transparent  and measurable. It is absolutely clear: Resources are becoming  increasingly scarce – and, as a result, prices for raw materials are  rising. That is why we are already thinking about the next logical  step in the transformation: how to significantly reduce our resource  consumption. This will be a crucial lever to achieving sustainable  development and profitable growth in the future. The BMW Group will gradually increase the percentage of secondary  material it uses in its vehicles to 50 percent. This is a challenge  for all of us. That is why we can no longer think in a fragmented way.  In light of the ongoing UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, I  will address these issues at the COP's Sustainable Innovation Forum  next Monday. Our shared goal of lowering CO2 emissions  quickly and on a massive scale demands cooperation at the global  level. This applies specifically to CO2 pricing. We  support pricing as the most efficient measure to curb carbon emissions  – provided it is regulated across national borders and in a uniform  manner. It is very important that the steering effect of policy is  aimed in this direction. In all sectors, sustainability and digitisation have long been  closely linked. That is precisely why we have established the  industrial flagship project Catena-X – which we now seek to strengthen further. Catena-X creates transparency, from small suppliers to OEMs. This  cross-sectoral connectivity is a real advantage for Europe as a  manufacturing location. Today’s modern vehicles are already shaped  largely by software. With research and development activities at 10  locations worldwide – our own and, also, at our joint ventures – we  have a total of around 10,000 IT and software specialists working on  digitisation of vehicles. We have been moving forward with  connectivity in our vehicles for more than two decades. And we are  seeing this again right now: By the end of this year, the BMW Group will have the world's largest  fleet of vehicles on the road with “over-the-air” update and upgrade  capabilities. With Remote Software Upgrade, our vehicles always have  the very latest technology – just like the updates we are all used to  on our smartphones. This benefits our customers directly: Their vehicle is not only  always up to date;" it also keeps on getting better because we can  access every line of programming code in the vehicle. Our customers  can also purchase or subscribe to new functions and features. With  high-end connectivity, such as 5G in the iX, our vehicles are  transformed into a smart device within the customer’s own digital ecosystem. Standardisation is key to the digitisation of cars. We believe it makes sense to develop common, standardised basic  elements for vehicle operating systems in conjunction with other OEMs  and suppliers. The use of open-source software is highly relevant in  this respect – to make sure we are all speaking the same language.  There is no need to reinvent the wheel. We can ensure a high level of  economic efficiency and, at the same time, make use of existing  digital ecosystems, such as Google’s Android Open-Source Project. In this process, we are working with tech players like Apple, Amazon,  Tencent, Google and Intel – while still competing with them. I see  this less as a clash between OEMs and tech giants, and more as an  expression of the market reality in the digital age and a way to  guarantee further progress. Ladies and Gentlemen,In a multi-layered transformation process, employees are a meaningful  seismograph that provides a valuable indication of the state of a  company. We received over 100,000 responses to our Employee  Survey in October – the highest ever. And the results show a very  positive trend in all categories compared to the surveys in 2017 and  2019. They showed that the vast majority of our global team are  confident about the future of the BMW Group – across all divisions and  hierarchy levels. This spirit and optimism demonstrate to me that: We are finding solutions and moving fast – and taking our people  along with us. This is how the BMW Group will remain on course for  long-term success – by being profitable, innovative and responsible.

Statement Dr Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Conference Call Quarterly Statement to 30 September 2021;Statement Dr Peter Conference Call Q3 2021. ;Good Morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. The BMW Group’s positive business development in the first nine  months of the year confirms our strategic course. Throughout the semiconductor crisis, our employees have delivered  outstanding performance, month after month. That is how we were able  to raise our expected targets for the year again in September. All segments are on track to meet our guidance for the year. We  continue to focus on gearing the BMW Group towards emission-free  mobility – funding the investments needed from our ongoing business. We will keep our Performance Programme going, with a main focus on  the consistent exploitation of market potential. Moreover, we are picking up the pace in the digitalisation of  processes across the entire company. And we will continue to work  consistently on the optimisation of our working capital, in particular  on our logistics. Let's start with the financial figures for the Group.Group revenues for the first three quarters of 2021 climbed by 19.2%  to 82.83 billion euros. Third-quarter revenues increased to 27.47  billion euros. As expected, Group earnings before tax for the year to the end of  September were significantly higher than the previous year, at 13.15  billion euros. The figure for the third quarter was 3.42 billion  euros. The Group EBT margin for the year to the end of September was  15.9%;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Group boosts performance with significantly higher earnings;Automotive segment reports nine-month free cash flow of € 6.3 billion  Segment EBIT margin comes in at 11.3% for nine months  BMW brand grows nine-month market share in Europe, Asia and Americas  Deliveries of fully electric vehicles up by 121.4% for nine-month period  Raised outlook for full year 2021 confirmed  ;"Munich. The BMW Group continued to demonstrate its  high level of profitability in the period from July to September 2021,  with revenues, profit before tax and net profit all at record levels  for a third quarter. The Group’s strong performance during this period  was driven in particular by favourable product mix factors and  positive pricing effects for new vehicles as well as stable selling  prices of pre-owned vehicles. The BMW Group also posted new record figures for deliveries to  customers, revenues and profit before tax for the nine-month period  and, in light of this strong performance, confirmed its outlook for  the full year at the quarterly press conference. The outlook for the  current year was raised in an ad-hoc announcement dated 30 September,  clearly demonstrating the Group's underlying profitability. At the same time, the Group is relentlessly driving forward the  process of becoming a climate-neutral premium automobile manufacturer. ""The BMW Group shows how profitability and transformation go  hand in glove. We see technological change as a great opportunity to  strengthen our business model on a sustainable basis. With our focus  on climate-neutral mobility, we are consistently driving the company  forward to make it future-proof,"" said Oliver  Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, in  Munich on Wednesday. The BMW Group’s consistent focus on sustainability, ultimately  leading to a circular economy, was underlined with the unveiling of  the BMW i Vision Circular concept vehicle at the IAA  in Munich in September. This first, fully recycled and recyclable  vision vehicle created by the BMW Group provides a forward glimpse of  sustainable premium mobility in the year 2040. ""When it comes to climate protection, the relevant question is:  how big is the carbon footprint of a vehicle over its entire life  cycle, including the impact of raw materials, industrial production,  the active use of the vehicle and recycling? That is the currency that  ultimately counts and the one by which our performance will be  measured,"" Zipse emphasised. ""That's why  our understanding of sustainability goes far beyond developing e-drive  systems. We aim to leverage circular economy principles to achieve a  maximum of climate protection – starting with the sustainable  selection of individual raw materials for production and considering  the life cycle of our vehicles as a whole."" E-mobility expanding at faster pace – high growth rates achievedThe BMW Group is swiftly and systematically expanding its range of  electrified models. With demand for electrified vehicles on the rise,  it sold 231,575 fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles during  the first nine months of 2021, twice as many as one year earlier  (2020: 116,400 units";4.50%;  adjusted for currency factors: +3.5%). Revenue growth for the  nine-month period was even more pronounced, rising significantly to  € 82,831 million (2020:  € 69,508 million;19.20%;" adjusted for currency factors: +20.5%). The improved price penetration for new and pre-owned vehicles is  primarily due to the BMW Group’s attractive product range, strong  customer demand and the generally lower availability of vehicles due  to the shortage of semiconductors. """"Business during the current financial year to date has  benefited substantially from the favourable stable market situation  and continued brisk demand,"""" said Nicolas Peter,  Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance. """"The latest  set of reported figures underlines the operational strength of the BMW  Group and demonstrates the outstanding commitment of our  workforce."""" Looking ahead to the upcoming changes in the BMW  Group's business model, he added: """"Our ability to generate profit  is the prerequisite for transforming our business model. Our stated  policy is to finance the necessary investments out of ongoing  operations. With a combination of prudent planning, good management  and a keen focus on efficiency and profitability, we are excellently  positioned to do so."""" Future-oriented investments remain at high levelResearch and development activities during the period under report  were focused on new models as well as on the electrification and  digitisation of the vehicle fleet and automated driving, in other  words on key issues in terms of driving the process of transformation  and strengthening the company’s future viability. R&D  expenses recognised in the income statement amounted to € 1,600 million in the third quarter, 13.8% up on the  previous year, taking the total for the nine-month period to € 4,337 million (2020: € 4,140 million"; +4.8%). Total    R&D expenditure amounted to € 4,369 million, slightly lower than one year earlier  (2020: € 4,397 million; -0.6%). Due to revenue growth, the research and development  ratio for the nine-month period fell slightly from 6.3% to  5.3% (in the third quarter: 6.5%; 2020: 5.9%). Group profit before financial result (EBIT) rose to € 10,913 million (2020: € 2,633 million) for the  nine-month period and to € 2,883 million (2020: € 1,924 million) for  the third quarter. In addition to improved pricing for new and  pre-owned vehicles, as described above, EBIT also benefited from the  unchanged low level of allowances required to be recognised for credit  risks. The partial reversal of the provision for EU antitrust  proceedings recorded in the second quarter also had a positive impact  on nine-month earnings. The financialresult for the nine-month period was a net positive  amount of € 2,240 million (2020: € 329 million; in the third  quarter: € 534 million; 2020: € 540 million). The result from  investments benefited in particular from the Group’s share of the  profit reported by the Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive  Ltd., Shenyang, which increased to € 1,475 million for the nine-month  period (2020: € 959 million; +53.8%). Other financial result went up to a net positive amount of  € 940 million (2020: negative € 282 million; in the third quarter:  positive € 173 million; 2020: positive € 200 million), whereby the  improvement was mainly attributable to the continued favourable fair  value development of interest rate hedges resulting from the rise in  yield curves in the USA. The remeasurement of investments held by the  BMW i Ventures fund as well as the investment in SGL Carbon had a  positive impact. Group profit before tax (EBT) amounted to € 13,153 million (2020: € 2,962 million; in the third  quarter: € 3,417 million; 2020: € 2,464 million). The pre-tax return on sales (EBT margin) came in at  15.9% for the nine-month period (2020: 4.3%) and  12.4% for the third quarter (2020: 9.4%). Nine-month delivery figures significantly up on previous year Automotive segment sales in the third quarter of 2021  were impacted by semiconductor supply issues. Deliveries to customers  in Europe and Asia were down, whereas sales in the Americas region  rose year on year. Over the nine-month period, however, sales  growth was recorded for all major regions worldwide,  including an excellent performance on European  markets, where deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand  vehicles were up by 11.9% to 725,721 units (2020:  648,494 units). The limited availability of semiconductors caused third-quarter  deliveries in Asia to fall to 254,739  units (2020: 288,907 units; -11.8%). However, the figure  contrasts sharply with Group performance over the nine-month period,  during which 835,090 units were delivered to  customers (2020: 705,789 units; +18.3%). Third-quarter sales figures for China dropped to    203,008 units (2020: 230,920 units; ‑12.1%). Here,  too, figures were well up over the nine-month period, with 670,964BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles delivered to  customers since the beginning of 2021, 19.7% more than in the same  period one year earlier (2020: 560,367 units). Overall, the BMW Group has continued to strengthen its competitive  position in all key regions. Mirroring this positive trend, sales  volume growth at brand level also ranged between ‘solid’ and  ‘significant’ for the nine-month period. Worldwide, BMW  brand sales climbed by 19.3% (2021: 1,703,068 units; 2020: 1,427,392 units). MINI  brand deliveries increased to 224,838 units (2020: 208,124; +8.0%), whereby the 106.6%  growth in sales of electrified models – particularly the fully  electric MINI SE* – contributed considerably to the overall growth  recorded. The ultra-luxury brand Rolls-Royce  delivered 4,318 units to customers between January and September,  setting a new record for the period with an increase of 62.9% (2020:  2,651 units). Automotive segment revenues rose significantly to    € 70,373 million in the first nine months of the  current financial year (2020: € 54,829 million; +28.3%), of which    € 22,628 million were recorded in the third quarter  (2020: € 21,962 million; +3.0%). Profit before financial result (EBIT) jumped to    € 7,945 million (2020: € 152 million; in the third  quarter: € 1,756 million; 2020: € 1,477 million; +18.9%), giving an    EBIT margin of 11.3% (2020: 0.3%)  for the nine-month period and 7.8% (2020: 6.7%) for  the three-month period from July to September 2021. As expected, the  third quarter was impacted to a greater degree by higher raw materials  prices and fixed costs (in particular R&D expenses) as well as by  the lower sales volume. The nine-month financial result recorded by the    Automotive segment amounted to € 1,711  million (2020: € 615 million, in the third quarter: € 374  million, 2020: € 383 million). As described above, the main driving  factors were the improved result from the at-equity accounted Chinese  joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BBA) and positive  valuation effects recognised in other financial result arising on  investments held by the BMW i Ventures fund as well as on the  investment in SGL Carbon. Segment profit before tax (EBT) amounted to €    9,656 million (2020: € 767 million) for the nine-month  period and € 2,130 million (2020: € 1,860 million;  +14.5%) for the third quarter. Free cash flow generated by the Automotive segment  amounted to € 1,397 million for the third quarter and  to € 6,299 million for the nine-month period. The  increase in cash flows from operating activities mainly reflected  higher earnings before tax and the favourable development of working  capital. Automotive segment free cash flow for the full year is  expected to be in the region of € 6.5 billion. Motorcycles segment reports higher revenues and earningsBMW Motorrad delivered 156,609  motorcycles and maxi-scooters (2020: 129,599 units; +20.8%) to  customers in the first nine months of 2021. With 48,999  units recorded during the third quarter, deliveries decreased  compared to the previous year due to model changes and supply issues  (2020: 52,892 units; -7.4%). Revenues rose  significantly to € 2,262 million (2020: € 1,716  million; +31.8%) for the nine-month period, including € 641  million recorded in the third quarter (2020: € 637 million;  +0.6%). Segment EBIT developed accordingly, rising  significantly to € 323 million for the nine-month  period (2020: € 110 million), but remaining below the previous year at    € 39 million for the third quarter (2020: € 45  million; -13.3%). The segment EBIT margin came in at    14.3% (2020: 6.4%) for the nine-month period and  6.1% (2020: 7.1%) for the third quarter. Financial Services segment reports strong growth in new businessThe Financial Services segment reported significant  growth in new business with retail customers in the period from  January to September with 1,509,195 new credit financing and leasing contracts signed,  up by 12.4% on the previous year (2020: 1,342,803 contracts). New  business concluded with retail customers during the nine-month period  also rose sharply by 16.2% to € 48,000 million (2020:  € 41,311 million), with the Chinese market in particular contributing  to the recorded growth. In the third quarter, however, the supply-related reduction in  deliveries resulted in a lower number of new contracts (2021: 479,850  new contracts; 2020: 538,351 new contracts; ‑10.9%). Over the nine-month period, 50.7% of new BMW Group  vehicles were either leased or financed by the Financial Services  segment (2020: 50.5%; +0.2 percentage points). Segment earnings developed extremely positively in both the  three-month and nine-month periods. Segmentprofit before tax (EBT) reached a new record level  with € 2,924 million (2020: € 1,039 million, in the third  quarter: € 988 million;" 2020: € 458 million). Higher revenues  generated from the remarketing of lease returns, particularly in the  USA and the UK also drove up earnings. Moreover, segment profit  benefited from the favourable risk situation as well as the stable  margins arising on new business. BMW Group confirms adjusted outlook for full yearThe BMW Group raised its outlook for the full year on 30 September.  With its attractive product portfolio, it expects to continue  benefiting from a sustained favourable product mix and positive  pricing effects for new and pre-owned vehicles. The BMW Group continues to forecast a Group profit before tax  that is significantly higher than in the previous year. The Automotive segment is expected to record a solid  year-on-year increase in the number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand  vehicles delivered to customers and RoCE is forecast to improve significantly.The EBIT margin for the Automotive segment for the full year is set  to finish within a range of 9.5% to 10.5% (outlook prior to the ad-hoc  announcement dated 30 September: 7% to 9%). The Financial Services segment is forecast to  achieve a return on equity (RoE) for the full year within a range of  20 to 23% (outlook prior to the ad-hoc announcement: 17% to 20%) due  to the improved risk situation. The Motorcycles segment is expected to record a  significant increase in deliveries on the back of a positive market  trend. The EBIT margin is set to finish within a target range of 8 to  10%, leading to a considerably higher level of RoCE than one year earlier. The BMW Group also reaffirms its forecast for non-financial    performance indicators. Accordingly, the proportion of  women in management functions is expected to increase slightly. At the  same time, the BMW Group is targeting a further significant reduction  in the carbon emissions generated by its EU new vehicle fleet.  According to current expectations, carbon emissions per vehicle  produced are likely to fall moderately. The Group's targets for the year are to be met with a    slightly smaller workforce. Forecasts for the  current year are based on the assumption that economic and political  conditions worldwide will not change significantly.  However, any deterioration of these factors could have a negative  impact on the BMW Group’s outlook. """"We are firmly on course to  meet our outlook for the full year and we look ahead with confidence  ,"""" said Nicolas Peter. """"We expect the  semiconductor supply situation to remain an issue beyond 2021.” * * * The BMW Group – an overviewJan. – Sept. 2021Jan. – Sept. 2020Change in %Deliveries to customers1Automotiveunits1,932,2241,638,16718.0thereof:         BMW2units1,703,0681,427,39219.3 MINIunits224,838208,1248.0 Rolls-Royceunits4,3182,65162.9Motorcyclesunits156,609129,59920.8     Automotive segment          EBIT margin%11.30.3-Motorcycles          segment EBIT margin%14.36.4-EBT margin BMW Group3%15.94.3-     Revenues€ million82,83169,50819.2thereof:        Automotive€ million70,37354,82928.3Motorcycles€ million2,2621,71631.8Financial        Services€ million24,17922,0559.6Other        Entities€ million31-Eliminations€ million-13,986-9,09353.8     Profit before financial result        (EBIT)€ million10,9132,633-thereof:        Automotive€ million7,945152-Motorcycles€ million323110-Financial        Services€ million2,8691,057-Other        Entities€ million-343-Eliminations€ million-2211,271-     Profit/loss before tax (EBT)€ million13,1532,962-thereof:        Automotive€ million9,656767-Motorcycles€ million324108-Financial        Services€ million2,9241,039-Other        Entities€ million378-290-Eliminations€ million-1291,338-     Income taxes€ million-2,946-785-Net profit€ million10,2072,177-Earnings per share(common/preferred share) 4 €15.38/15.393.20/3.21-1In connection with a review of its sales practices and  related reporting practices, the BMW Group has reviewed prior-period  vehicle delivery data and ascertained that certain vehicle deliveries  were not reported in the correct periods.

MINI is now charting the course for the future on the platform of this self-assured mindset.;1. INTRODUCTION. Blue-skies thinking, seeing challenges as opportunities, taking the  wishes and needs of individuals into account openly and  unconventionally – all these facets are firmly anchored in the  tradition of the MINI brand. MINI is now charting the course for the  future on the platform of this self-assured mindset. This involves  MINI taking up the current challenges in the areas of mobility, energy  economy and climate protection and facing up to them with independent  solutions for the driving fun of tomorrow that is so typical of the  brand. The strategy developed for this is based on the campaign slogan  BIG LOVE. This symbolises the close commitment of the brand to the  fundamental natural requirements of our planet, to human beings in all  their diversity, to technological progress and to profitable growth as  a manufacturer of premium cars.The classic Mini was the ideal answer for contemporary issues of the  time. It was developed during the era of the Suez oil crisis and was  primarily an economical car that took a creative approach to space,  occupied a minimal amount of space on the road and fitted into tiny  parking spaces in urban centres. The classic Mini had a small  footprint but offered enough space for four people and their luggage.  Its revolutionary vehicle concept helped the pint-sized car to achieve  its status as a classless car, which boasted a broad community of  enthusiasts for unique driving fun all over the world. For the past 20  years, the modern MINI has been transferring these principles to the  premium segment of small cars. Sustainability, social diversity, a  spirit of innovation and the opportunity to tap into new target groups  and markets are therefore elementary strengths of the brand. MINI is  deploying these characteristics to meet the current challenges in the  area of urban mobility and adopts a confident approach.A clear acknowledgement of sustainability is expressed in a  continuous reduction of the CO2 footprint for each car over  the entire production lifecycle. This encompasses the supply chain and  the exclusive use of green electricity in production. Further  contributing factors will be complete electrification of the model  range by the early 2030s and a steadily increasing proportion of  natural and recyclable materials used in the vehicles.There is much more to the social responsibility being taken on by  MINI. The classless car of yesteryear has long become the ideal  vehicle for a diverse community. Male and female MINI drivers are  individualists and at the same time part of a big community that  interprets diversity as an enrichment for everybody. The team  developing, producing and selling MINI models is diverse. As a  manufacturer of premium cars operating on the global stage, MINI is  committed to social diversity and supports initiatives that promote  tolerance and an open society. The extent to which MINI feels  committed to the positive zest for life of people is also demonstrated  by a further commitment. MINI progresses solutions through the  accelerator URBAN-X which improve life where the majority of people  live: in towns and cities.MINI is working up fresh ideas on the design of urban mobility in the  future. Alongside innovative vehicle concepts such as the MINI Vision  Urbanaut, this entrepreneurial approach includes pioneering  developments in the area of digital services and products.  Consequently, the User Experience associated with the use of the  display and control system of MINI makes a major contribution to the  driving fun so typical of the brand. Seamless integration of their  smartphones empowers MINI customers to remain fully connected with  their digital life while they are in their car. Furthermore, the MINI  App is morphing into a community platform that not only deepens the  relationship between driver and car but also connects MINI fans with  each other.“MINI was always the answer to very special challenges for individual  mobility. And the willingness to rethink the status quo defines the  brand to the present day,” commented Bernd Körber, Head of MINI.  “Alongside electromobility, the development of new target groups and  sales markets is a key factor for the future of MINI.” Starting as  early as 2023, MINI is presenting a new generation of all-electric  models. Two of the models developed from the ground up for pure  electric mobility are being produced in China. Local production offers  MINI optimised opportunities as a provider to participate more  extensively than before in the dynamic growth in the Chinese  automotive market. From 2023, the successor to the current MINI  Countryman will be built at the BMW Group Plant Leipzig, powered by an  electrified drive and with a combustion engine. All other MINI models  will be produced at the MINI Plant Oxford, which remains the heart of  MINI production. The United Kingdom will continue to be the home of  the MINI brand.2. BIG LOVE FOR THE PLANET. THE MINI STRATEGY FOR CONSISTENT SUSTAINABILITY.Anyone selecting MINI will always be opting for sustainability. The  principle of achieving more with less is part of the brand’s  tradition. Way back in 1959, the designer of the classic Mini, Alec  Issigonis, showed how effective and sustainable a car can be if it has  a footprint on the road with a length of slightly over three metres  while providing transport for four passengers and their luggage from A  to B. The revolutionary design principle with the four-cylinder engine  fitted crosswise at the front and the wheels positioned at the corners  of the car also resulted in exceptionally agile driving  characteristics at a low fuel consumption.As a brand of the BMW Group, MINI is also dedicated to the strategic  sustainability goals of the company. In 2020, the BMW Group developed  its own agenda, which was even more ambitious than the goal of the  Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, to limit global warming to less than  two degrees Celsius. The company is therefore ready to meet the  requirements of the EU programme “Fit for 55”, which provides for  reducing the CO2 emissions of new car fleets by 55 percent  from 2030. The contribution by MINI includes consistent  electrification of the model range. As early as the beginning of the  2030s, MINI will be an all-electric brand.Consistent CO2 reduction over the entire value chain.In order to achieve this objective, the CO2 footprint  will be consistently reduced over the entire value chain, including  production and upstream supply chain. By 2030, the BMW Group is  planning a per-vehicle reduction of CO2 emissions in this  area by at least 40 percent compared with 2019. Over the long term,  the BMW Group has defined the objective of establishing a  climate-neutral business model over the entire value chain by the year 2050.Binding environmental standards ensure that the CO2  emissions within the supply chain will undergo a 20 percent reduction  by the year 2030. The fact alone that the suppliers involved in the  production of battery cells for vehicles powered by an electric  drivetrain use exclusively green electricity means that over the  coming ten years around ten million tons less CO2 will be  released into the atmosphere. MINI uses comparatively small energy  storage systems for the design of high-voltage batteries. These ensure  a range appropriate for urban mobility while simultaneously not  impairing electricity consumption and the agility of the vehicles  through excessively high weight. Transparent procurement monitored by  the BMW Group ensures that the raw materials necessary for the  construction of high-voltage batteries are compliant with  environmental and social standards. The high-voltage batteries  developed for electrically-powered models of MINI secure a long  lifetime. After their application in the car, they can also be used in  stationary storage systems for buildings also over a very long period.  The storage units only have to be recycled after this repurposing and  secondary use has finished. At the present time, more than 90 percent  of the raw materials used in the batteries can be recycled.Also after the year 2030, a reduction of CO2 emissions by  80 percent is projected in the production of each vehicle. This means  that the sustainability standards already achieved in BMW Group plants  to date will be once again ramped up. At present, each MINI is already  manufactured with a carbon-neutral footprint. Use of 100 percent green  electricity at the MINI Plant Oxford makes a contribution to this. A  proportion of this electricity is generated on site locally. One of  the biggest photovoltaic generation systems in the United Kingdom has  been installed on the roof of the production facilities. Around 11 500  solar cells with an output of around three megawatts generate  electricity from solar energy and thereby save around 1 500 tons of  CO2 each year. 18 LNG-operated trucks are also being  deployed in Oxford. They are powered by organic Liquid Natural Gas and  thereby contribute to additional CO2 reduction in the  production process. The successor to the current MINI Countryman will  be manufactured at the site of the BMW Group Plant Leipzig from 2023  onwards and wind turbines located here generate green electricity for  vehicle production.By 2030, a reduction of at least half of the CO2 emissions  compared with 2019 is projected for each vehicle and each kilometre  driven. The electrification of the drivetrain plays a key role here.  At an early stage, MINI took on a pioneering function in the  development of local emission-free premium mobility. The field trials  launched with a test fleet of 600 MINI E cars in 2009 yielded  important findings about the use of an all-electric drive under  practical, real-life working conditions in everyday urban traffic.The brand already has two models in its product range with plug-in  hybrid model MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 (combined fuel  consumption: 2.1 – 1.7 l/100 km, combined electricity consumption:  15.5 – 14.8 kWh/100 km, combined CO2 emissions: 47 – 39  g/km in compliance with WLTP) and the all-electric powered MINI Cooper  SE (combined fuel consumption: 0.0 l/100 km, combined electricity  consumption: 17.6 – 15.2 kWh/100 km, combined CO2  emissions: 0 g/km in compliance with WLTP) that permit local  emission-free driving fun. If the high-voltage battery of the MINI  Cooper SE is charged with energy from the conventional EU electricity  mix, the CO2 footprint is reduced by around 36 percent in  comparison with a like-for-like MINI 3-door car powered by a petrol  engine. If electricity is only used from renewable sources, the  reduction is even as much as up to 70 percent.The MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 and the MINI Cooper SE meanwhile  make up 15 percent of the total global sales of MINI. This proportion  is projected to increase to 50 percent by 2027. At the beginning of  the 2030s, MINI will only have all-electric powered models in its range.Innovative materials, greater use of secondary raw materials.Engineers at MINI are always finding new ways to provide maximum  protection for natural resources in their selection of raw materials.  For example, the proportion of secondary raw materials used in each  vehicle is gradually being significantly increased for this purpose.  By comparison with primary materials, this approach once again permits  a substantial reduction of CO2 emissions in production. An  increasing proportion of secondary aluminium is another measure that  will be used in future.Recycled materials will also be employed in areas such as the roof  liner, and for upholstery materials, seats, foot mats and floor  coverings. In future, natural-fibre materials and plastics obtained  from recycled PET bottles will be used instead of leather. Recycled  fishing nets will form the raw materials for floor mats. The potential  for renewable materials is used particularly comprehensively in the  study MINI Vision Urbanaut. The entire interior is free of leather and  chrome. Instead, natural materials like cork are used for the steering  wheel and on sections of the floor, and removable covers made of  knitted textile are also used. This creates a pleasant ambience in a  natural way.Tailor-made sustainability and with maximum consistency: MINI STRIP.MINI STRIP was recently presented as an unconventional example  so typical of MINI, demonstrating how creative thinking can pave the  way towards more sustainability. This custom special was created in a  collaboration between MINI and the British fashion designer Paul  Smith. A tailor-made one of one was designed on the basis of a MINI  Cooper SE incorporating the themes “Simplicity, Transparency,  Sustainability”. As the name of the car suggests, this vehicle was  reduced to its structural essence. Ultimately, only those elements  regarded by Paul Smith as absolutely essential were used.This consistent focus on sustainability resulted in features such as  a radically reduced interior where the conventional four-part  instrument panel is replaced by a large, semi-transparent component  with a smoked-glass look and the customer’s smartphone takes on the  function of the central instrument. Untreated panels and recycled  materials from a 3D printer are the dominant feature in the exterior.  Visible bolts on the mounted parts indicate that the individual  components can be easily dismantled and fed back into the raw-material  cycle at the end of the vehicle lifecycle.Support for initiatives benefiting sustainability.MINI is pursuing a large number of activities beyond the  boundaries of manufacturing cars which are targeted at enhancing the  quality of life and sustainability in the urban environment. These  measures include, for example, cooperation between MINI and the  non-profit organisation Earthwatch Europe in the United Kingdom called  the “Tiny Forest” initiative. Just as a small space in MINI is used  highly efficiently, MINI also supports the “Tiny Forest” initiative  being implemented by the environmental conservationists. Alongside the  British body-pressing plant in Swindon, MINI has commissioned the  planting of around 600 trees very close to each other, which will be  allowed to grow in a completely natural way. This initiative captures  additional CO2 and creates a habitat for more than 500  species of animal and plant. Another “Tiny Forest” is planned at the  MINI Plant Oxford in 2022.Local initiatives are also presented on the platform MINI VOICES.  These have the potential to change the world. One example of this is  provided by the architect Clarisse Merlet showcased by MINI France.  She developed a method of obtaining environmentally benign  construction materials from clothing that cannot be recovered. Her  FabBRICK start-up based in Paris produces bricks made from recycled  textile waste. The Swiss start-up Umami also presented on MINI VOICES  produces microgreens, which are grown in an aquaponics system. The  nutritious plants form a closed-loop circulation together with fish  and freshwater shrimps. They are cultivated here without any  artificial fertilisers. The microgreens from the start-up are supplied  to prestigious restaurants in Zurich.3. BIG LOVE FOR THE PEOPLE. THE ENGAGEMENT OF MINI FOR DIVERSITY AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.MINI promotes diversity – inside and outside the MINI organisation.  As an international company, community and social responsibility are a  top priority at MINI. This also includes a clearly-defined commitment  to diversity within the company. “We are all different, but pretty  good together” – employees at MINI all over the world are cooperating  successfully in accordance with this motto. MINI perceives diversity  as a strength. The company is convinced that diverse teams are more  creative and more innovative. They are therefore a key factor for  success in competition for new markets, customers and qualified  up-and-coming talent.The approach has been firmly anchored in the DNA of MINI since its  foundation in 1959. The designer of the classic Mini, Alec Issigonis,  was born in Turkey in 1906 as the son of a mother originating from  Bavaria and a British father of Greek origin.Open, free of prejudice and respectful corporate culture.MINI – building on the diversity strategy of the BMW Group – has  set up the MINI Diversity Programme in order to continue to strengthen  the awareness for all dimensions of diversity within the company and  to exert a positive impact on the corporate culture. At MINI, this  means living and promoting a corporate culture, in which all employees  are treated with equal value and respect, regardless of their origin,  identity, age, sexual orientation, and whether or not they have a  disability. This is all about creating an optimum working environment  in an open and respectful corporate culture that is entirely free of prejudice.MINI has always been a brand that brings together different people.  This is also demonstrated in the motto asserted by the global premium  car manufacturer on its journey to an inclusive future: “We are all  different, but pretty good together”. The company raises the awareness  of its employees and its managers to topics associated with diversity  through training sessions, presentations and dialogue formats.The everyday working environment at MINI has a long track record of  demonstrating progress for absolute equality in the staffing structure  for departments, responsibilities and management positions of all  types. Today, there are already more women than men working in the  total workforce at MINI.The company has defined targets in relation to the proportion of  women for sustainable promotion of women in management functions. In  order to achieve these targets, MINI has carefully analysed existing  measures and programmes and strategically optimised them. These  include new formats for strategic promotion of female junior managers  and the possibility of organising management functions with two  persons in joint leadership. Furthermore, MINI ensures a high  proportion of women in the junior management promotion programmes and  is committed to seamless return to the world of work after parental leave.Experience driving fun: MINI Safety Training for people with disabilities.Outside the company’s own organisational structure, MINI is  committed to openness and diversity. As part of this engagement, the  BMW and MINI Driving Academy programme now includes a safety training  course for people with disabilities and this enhances driving fun for them.In order to achieve this target, training vehicles are converted so  that they have hand controls. This means that both hands can always  remain on the steering wheel. An additional ring on the steering wheel  is used to accelerate. A special brake lever is configured directly  alongside. These conversions allow vehicles such as the 170 kW/231 hp  MINI John Cooper Works (combined fuel consumption: 7.1 – 6.8 l/100 km  in compliance with WLTP, 7.1 – 6.9 l/100 km in compliance with NEDC;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Group Plant Leipzig launches series production of second-generation BMW 2 Series Active Tourer ; Seamless integration into the production process  BMW Group draws on front-wheel-drive expertise of Plant Leipzig  Dynamic styling, re-designed interior, state-of-the-art connectivity  ;Leipzig. BMW Group Plant Leipzig is launching series  production of the second generation of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer.  Having first reached dealerships almost seven years ago, in the autumn  of 2014, the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer was quick to establish itself  in the market. More than 400,000 customers have since opted to buy the  premium compact, which combines functional spaciousness with a dynamic  drive concept. More than 368,000 of the vehicles concerned were  manufactured in Leipzig. The successor of the sporty all-rounder will  be made in Leipzig only.“After the successful debut of the first-generation BMW 2 Series  Active Tourer, BMW Group Plant Leipzig is proud to produce its  completely redesigned successor,” emphasised Plant Director Hans-Peter  Kemser. “This vehicle is another opportunity for us to prove our  wealth of experience and expertise in the manufacture of front-wheel  drives in the BMW production network. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer  will also keep our plant running at capacity over the longer term.”The key characteristics of the latest model generation are its  extremely dynamic styling, clear design language and redesigned  interior. In addition, the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer takes mild  hybrid technology into the compact class for the very first time,  along with the latest connectivity features and extended equipment packages.BMW 2 Series Active Tourer sets new standardsMaking its debut back in 2014, the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer caused  a revolution in the BMW product portfolio. Not only did it establish  the Sports Activity Tourer segment, it was also the first front-wheel  drive BMW. With its functional space concept, three-cylinder engines –  a first for BMW at the time – and cutting-edge front-wheel drive, the  newcomer offered all the dynamism of a BMW and heralded a new era for  the brand.The second-generation BMW 2 Series Active Tourer sets standards once  again. A pioneer, it paves the way for the forthcoming BMW and MINI  models joining the compact segment over the coming years. Aspects such  as the enhancements to the drivetrain and cockpit, and the new onboard  network – now found in petrol and diesel-powered BMW 2 Series Active  Tourer – all set new standards.Seamless integration into production processesRenowned for its extreme flexibility, Plant Leipzig had previously  been entrusted with the manufacture of the BMW Group’s first  electrified models – the BMW i3 and BMW i8. It is now the plant of  choice once again, for the launch of this new vehicle concept. Despite  the new requirements, only minor adjustments had to be made to the  paintshop and assembly systems, and the only new production area was  introduced into the bodyshop.The second generation of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer has now been  integrated into production just as seamlessly and will roll off  Leipzig’s production lines along with the BMW 1 Series and BMW 2  Series Gran Coupe.Dynamic design and updated interiorIn terms of exterior design, the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer now  exudes even more sportiness and self-assurance, thanks to its  dynamically elongated proportions and the clear, reduced treatment of  its surfaces.Inside, it offers a completely new sense of space. The interior has  been fully redesigned, taking its cues from the fully electric  technology flagship, the BMW iX. Particularly striking are the BMW  Curved Display, the ‘floating’ armrest with its integrated control  panel, and the slim instrument panel.

The new BMW K 1600 GT, K 1600 GTL, K 1600 B and K 1600 Grand America.;The new K 1600 models: Six-cylinder fascination for dynamic and luxurious riding, touring and cruising. ;The new K 1600 models: Six-cylinder fascination for dynamic    and luxurious riding, touring and cruising.Six-cylinder in-line engines have always belonged to the  showcase drives at BMW. Since 2010, BMW Motorrad offers fascinating  high-performance and luxurious six-cylinder equipment at the highest  level with the K 1600 models. The K 1600 GT  represents the particularly agile, dynamic variant of the six-cylinder  design, while the K 1600 GTL with its more  comfortable ergonomics and standard topcase is more for pleasurable  riding. The K 1600 B is of a completely different  breed. It provides characteristic “streamlining” with a low rear  section in bagger style. Its motto is “The Spirit of the Open Road”.  It represents elegance, power and luxury on two wheels and allows the  rider to experience every road, every tour and every moment  particularly intensively. Derived from the K 1600 B, the    K 1600 Grand America finally combines the superior  performance of the six-cylinder in-line engine with exclusive  equipment features that make long-distance rides in American highway  cruising style an experience that is as comfortable as it is  fascinating, both alone or with a partner.Revised six-cylinder in-line engine according to EU-5    regulations with new engine control, knock sensor system and revised    emission concept as well as engine drag torque  control.For use in the new K 1600 GT, GTL, B and Grand  America, the inspiring six-cylinder engine has been adapted to the  current EU-5 regulations. From a technical point of view, the use of  the BMS-O engine control, two knock sensors and two additional  broadband lambda probes form the centrepiece. In addition to  drastically improved emission values, there are also noticeable  benefits relating to the power and torque of the six-cylinder engine.  The nominal capacity is still 118 kW (160 hp). However, it is now  already achieved at a rotational speed of 6 750 rpm and thus 1 000 rpm  sooner than was formerly the case. In addition, the technical new  features provide an increase of the maximum torque from previously 175  Nm to now 180 Nm at a rotational speed of still 5 250 rpm. Even more  superior pulling power and even more powerful acceleration are the  noticeable positive effects for the rider.The engine drag torque control (MSR) is another new component.  With it, unstable riding conditions, which can develop in coasting  mode or when shifting down gears due to excessive slip at the rear  wheel, can be reliably avoided.Dynamic ESA “Next Generation” electronic suspension with fully    automatic load compensation.The BMW Motorrad Dynamic ESA “Next Generation” (Electronic  Suspension Adjustment) on the new K 1600 GT, GTL, B and Grand America  enables even higher dimensions in terms of riding safety, performance  and comfort, because damping is automatically adapted to the riding  conditions and manoeuvres, and there is also automatic riding position  compensation in all load states.Highly modern LED light units and new full LED adaptive headlight.BMW Motorrad has been a pioneer for decades in terms of safety  when biking. Accordingly, the new K 1600 GT, GTL, B and Grand America  already provide highly modern LED light units as standard. The new  full LED headlight with LED lens technology and iconic daytime riding  light (depending on the market) illuminates the road with an  unrivalled bright, clear light and underlines the prestige claim of  the new six-cylinder models. Another standard component of the  headlight is the swivelling “adaptive headlight” function. With it,  the low-beam LED headlight is turned into the curve according to the  heel angle. Curves are thus almost fully illuminated because the light  is where the motorbike is moving.In addition, by swivelling the entire headlight unit (±2°), the  vehicle dynamic states (braking, accelerating) are automatically  controlled and optimum illumination is ensured at all times. In  addition, there are a number of new light functions such as the  “welcome light”.New, 10.25 inch TFT colour display with integrated map    navigation, easy-to-use route planning and comprehensive    connectivity as standard.The new K 1600 GT, GTL, B and Grand America are  standard-equipped with a new 10.25 inch TFT colour display with  integrated map navigation and connectivity. Due to excellent  readability, clear menu navigation and a highly integrated operating  concept, they are at the top of their motorbike segment. The new 10.25  inch colour display allows a navigation map to be displayed on the  instrument cluster, meaning an additional display is not required.Audio system 2.0 – a new digital sound dimension as standard    or as optional equipment ex works.With audio system 2.0, the new K 1600 GTL and Grand America  already provide an even more intensive sound experience as standard.  The audio system is available as optional equipment ex works for the  K 1600 GT and K 1600 B.Superior riding capability and six-cylinder dynamics in    attractive basic colours, exclusive style and noble Option 719    variants. Option 719 “Midnight” with water transfer printing method    for K 1600 B and K 1600 Grand America.The new K 1600  GT, GTL, B and Grand America are available in three attractive colour  options each: a basic variant, a style variant and Option 719. Option  719 “Midnight” is particularly noteworthy, which is only available for  K 1600 B and K 1600 Grand America. The highlight of this equipment  variant is the paintwork in Meteoric Dust II metallic with the  “Galaxy” theme depicted using the water transfer printing method.Highlights of BMW K 1600 GT, GTL, B and Grand America:New audio system 2.0 as optional equipment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Available for a limited period of time in the  United States, the individual pieces commissioned especially for this  purpose will transform the iconic MINI rooftops into works of art and  will also go on display as murals in Brooklyn, New York, New York’s  SoHo neighbourhood and Portland, Oregon.“MINI is all about self-expression, and the rooftops convey this in  its purest form,” said Mike Peyton, Vice President, MINI of the  Americas. Now they will become true works of art. This special  collaboration is part of the MINI brand campaign BIG LOVE – two short  words with the power to inspire a world of positive action. The motto  is: “We’re all different, but pretty good together.” As part of this  project, MINI USA will be making a donation to the American  Immigration Council to support its mission.The works of art were created by three artists specially selected by  MINI and they reflect these individuals’ diverse cultural backgrounds  and experiences growing up in the United States of America:Rich Tu is an artist and designer based in Brooklyn.  He is a first-generation Filipino American who is particularly  interested in culture and the future. Rich hosts First Generation  Burden, a podcast focusing on the integration of immigrants in the  creative community.Striking colours, inherent movement and images full of detail are the  prevailing features of his highly personal works. Rich Tu’s powerful  visual style is inspired by his three passions: community, social  justice, and reflection on the first-generation immigrant experience  through self-expression. His work is entitled “Hiraya”, which is  derived from an old Filipino word meaning “fruit of hopes, dreams and aspirations”.Shane Griffin, also known as ‘Grif’, is an  award-winning, multi-disciplinary visual artist and director who is  originally from Dublin and now based in New York. Grif has worked with  many pop culture icons, including Kanye West, Kid Cudi and Wiz  Khalifa.

The BMW Group and Pirelli together with Birdlife International initiate project to contribute to safeguarding Indonesia’s natural ecosystem;The project encourages the production of natural rubber to protect biodiversity and local communities in the forest of Hutan Harapan;Munich, Milan, Cambridge. The BMW Group and Pirelli  are joining with Birdlife International in a three year project that  aims to favor the long-term production of sustainable and  deforestation-free natural rubber in Indonesia. Birdlife  International - an NGO that conserves global biodiversity, habitats  and birds – will be supported by its two new partners in actions to  benefit local communities, the conservation of the natural ecosystem  and protection of endangered animal species in the forests of  Indonesia. In Indonesia, the project is implemented by a number of  non-governmental organisations coordinated by the local consortium PT  Restorasi Ekosistem Indonesia (PT Reki). In Indonesia, the cultivation  of natural rubber is one of the traditional sources of income for the  local population.The project is located in part of the Hutan Harapan rainforest  (island of Sumatra), which is home to around 1,350 different animal  species. It will take the form of a series of initiatives aimed at    improving the quality of life of the indigenous communityby protecting farmers’ land rights and promoting women’s    rights, conserving a deforestation-free area of 2,700    hectares and protecting several endangered species. The  different activities will be implemented in line with the goals of the  Global Platform of Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR), the  multi-stakeholder platform for the sustainable development of the  natural rubber business, of which the BMW Group, Pirelli and Birdlife  International are founder members.The partnership between the BMW Group and Pirelli in support of  Indonesia’s Hutan Harapan forest is part of a joint pathway to  sustainable natural rubber. In this context, Pirelli developed and  produced the first tyre in the world, a Pirelli P ZERO, certified by  the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), fitted on the new BMW X5  Plug-in-Hybrid, in turn the first car in the world equipped with tyres  with this certification.  THE MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE PROJECTThe project presented by Pirelli, the BMW Group and Birdlife  International foresees the involvement of a number of stakeholders:  local communities, government agencies and the entire natural rubber  value chain.The three year program entails multiple activities, including: Birdlife International will coordinate with Pirelli and the BMW Group  on the project’s progress and results achieved through a plan of  periodic reporting. “As a premium manufacturer, our goal is to lead the way on    sustainability and actively take responsibility within our supply    chains. In the fight against climate change, we are rolling out targeted    measures to support bio-diversity and tropical rainforest    conservation,” said Dr Andreas Wendt, BMW AG Board Member for Purchasing and    Supplier Network.“Our project in Indonesia will help people and the local economy    to work in greater harmony with nature. At the same time, it will    also support local communities by professionalising their    traditional cultivation methods for natural rubber.” Giovanni Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli’s Senior Vice President    for Sustainability and Future Mobility, said: “The    development of this project is based on the principles of    transparency and tangibility which have always guided Pirelli’s    actions. Together with BMW Group, in support of the goals of    Birdlife we intend to be an active part of a project that aims to    have a sustainable impact all round on natural rubber, in the belief    that community, biodiversity and business must grow by supporting    each other, creating a shared socio-environmental value.” Patricia Zurita, CEO, BirdLife International,  commented: “BirdLife works beyond species and sites to address    systemic drivers of the biodiversity and climate crisis, and promote    a nature positive and carbon neutral world. This is why we joined    the GPSNR and welcome this collaboration with Pirelli and BMW to    embed practices to safeguard nature within the rubber value chain”.    BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONALBirdLife International is the world’s largest nature conservation    partnership, with 117 Partners. Our purpose is to conserve global    biodiversity, habitats and birds, working with people and business    in the sustainable use of natures’ resources.  To inform and advance    evidence-based business policy and practice, we offer a wealth of    proprietary data and tools, provide science-based consultation and    have boots on the ground in 115 countries. Globally, our science and    biodiversity data inform international policy dialogue, and in the    field of ‘environment & ecology’, BirdLife is ranked #1 in the    UK for high impact research. Locally, our Partners provide acute    insight at both a landscape and community level of issues and    solutions and have the legitimacy to engage and advocate at all    levels of government. PIRELLI AND SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RUBBER Pirelli places sustainable development at the heart of its own    growth, along the entire value chain. The sustainable management of the natural rubber supply chain has    seen Pirelli committed to a roadmap of activities based on training    and the sharing of good practices in the countries where the    material originates. This is in line with the principles and values    collected in the Policy      for the Sustainable Management of Natural Rubber that the    company launched in 2017 and updated in 2021. The Policy is the    result of consultations with key stakeholders in the natural rubber    value chain including international NGOs, Pirelli’s main suppliers    of natural rubber, intermediaries and growers of the supply chain,    automotive clients and multi-lateral international organizations. In    addition, Pirelli is one of the founder members of the Global    Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR), a multi-stakeholder    platform born in 2018 with the goal of supporting the sustainable    development of the natural rubber business at the global level, to    the benefit of the whole value chain. Uniting sustainability and    innovation, Pirelli is the first company in the world to have    produced a line of tyres with natural rubber and rayon both    certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). THE BMW GROUPWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the    BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles    and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility    services.

BMW M Motorsport News, 25th October 2021.;Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you a regular overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. ;The real-time documentary series MBEDDED offers an exclusive look  behind the scenes of the BMW M Motorsport LMDh project and shows you  real emotions of the protagonists on the way. Link to all MBEDDED episodes: https://b.mw/MBEDDED_Playlist. BMW M Motorsport teams test the BMW M4 GT3 at Valencia.It’s only a matter of months until the BMW M4 GT3 will be doing  battle for wins and titles around the world as the new flagship in the  hands of BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers. The first confirmed  highlights will be the 24-hour races in Dubai (UAE) and Daytona (USA)  in January 2022. To give the teams and drivers the best possible  chance to prepare with the new GT car, BMW M Motorsport organised a  week of testing at Valencia (ESP) in October, which was attended by  many buyers and interested parties. BMW works drivers Augusto Farfus  (BRA) and Jens Klingmann (GER), who have both been heavily involved in  the development of the BMW M4 GT3 so are very familiar with the car,  taught the guests all about the strengths and special features of the  successor to the BMW M6 GT3. After plenty of test laps, the feedback  from the BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers was extremely positive.  Robert Ravaglia (ITA), DTM Champion and World Touring Car Champion in  the BMW M3 E30 and current team manager of the Italian team Ceccato  Racing, was impressed after his test drive, and said: “Congratulations  to BMW M Motorsport on the development of this car. It was a fantastic  experience being allowed to take it for a spin for a couple of laps.  After my first few laps in the BMW M3 E30 – the most successful  touring car of all time – back in the 1980s, I could tell it was going  to be a winning car. And I had the same feeling today. The BMW M4 GT3  is a winning car.” ADAC GT Masters: Schubert Motorsport leave Hockenheim empty-handed.The penultimate race weekend of the ADAC GT Masters at Hockenheim  (GER) was disappointing for Schubert Motorsport. Despite their good  pace, Nick Yelloly (GBR) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) came away empty-handed  in the BMW M6 GT3 after incidents in both races. After qualifying in  eleventh place, the duo initially moved their way up the field well on  Saturday, but a tyre puncture late on in the race saw them cross the  finish line in P22. Yelloly was outstanding in qualifying on Sunday  and finished second to secure a place on the front row of the grid.  Unfortunately, a collision early in the race forced him to retire. ADAC GT4 Germany: Fight for the title coming to a head.Gabriele Piana (ITA) and Michael Schrey (GER) of Team Hofor Racing by  Bonk Motorsport showed real fighting spirit at a difficult penultimate  race weekend in the ADAC GT4 Germany at the Hockenheimring (GER) and  defended their lead in the drivers’ standings. It was in qualifying  that their BMW M4 GT4 really struggled, not allowing for any better  than eleventh and 22nd on the grid for the two races. From  that position the duo made up two places on Saturday and eleven on  Sunday, which saw them pick up important points for finishing in P9  and P11. In the overall standings, Piana and Schrey have a 21-point  advantage over their closest rivals going into the season finale on  the first weekend in November at the Nürburgring (GER). The best race  result for a BMW M Motorsport team at the Hockenheim weekend was  claimed by Nicolaj Möller-Madsen (DEN) and Philipp Miemois (FIN) on  Saturday. They finished seventh in the BMW M4 GT4 of AVIA Sorg Rennsport. BTCC: BMW wins sixth manufacturer’s title in a row.BMW won the manufacturer’s title in the British Touring Car  Championship (BTCC) for the sixth time in a row last weekend, making  history in the process.

In GT4 America, Stevan McAleer (GBR)  and Toby Grahovec (USA) in the #11 BMW M4 GT4 of Classic BMW finished  on the podium, in third place. In the TCX class of TC America, it was the BMW M2 CS Racing of the  BMW M Motorsport teams that was dominant once again at Indianapolis.  The man of the weekend was champion Jacob Ruud (USA) in the #81 BMW M2  CS Racing of Team Classic BMW, who had secured the title in the TCX  class at the penultimate event of the season at Sebring (USA). With  two further overall wins, number nine and ten of the year, he enjoyed  a superb finish to the season. “It’s a fantastic feeling. We had a  terrific season. The team provided me with an incredible car  throughout the whole season,” said Ruud. Classic BMW also won the team  standings and BMW won the manufacturer’s standings in the TCX class. In the first of the two TC America races, Steve Streimer (USA) in the  #30 BMW M2 CS Racing of Hard Motorsport rounded off the BMW one-two  result.

BMW Group Plant Munich goes fully electric; Plant Munich launches production of the fully electric BMW i4  At least half of all cars from Munich plant will be electrified by 2023  Project for emission-free transport logistics in home plant gets under way  Nedeljković: “BMW i4 is a milestone on the road to electric mobility.”; Plant Munich launches production of the fully electric BMW i4   At least half of all cars from Munich plant will be electrified by  2023  Project for emission-free transport logistics in home plant  gets under way  Nedeljković: “BMW i4 is a milestone on the road to  electric mobility.” Munich. The first series-produced BMW i4 has today  rolled off the production lines at BMW Group Plant Munich. The  company’s home plant now manufactures all drive variants on a single  assembly line. “For the plant and team, the launch of the BMW i4 is a  milestone on the road to electric mobility,” said Milan Nedeljković,  BMW AG Board Member for Production. “By 2023 more than half of all  vehicles from our Munich facility will have an electrified drive. The  majority will be fully electric. So Munich goes fully electric.” Setting up production of the fully electric BMW i4 in the confines of  the almost 100-year-old plant, the conversion and installation of  systems proved particularly challenging. “We succeeded in integrating  the new vehicle into our existing systems without halting production.  The team and our partners did an amazing job,” added Peter Weber,  Director of BMW Group Plant Munich. Space constraints notwithstanding,  existing systems were removed, and new ones installed and ramped up.  “Our bodyshop is a shining example of intelligent, efficient  integration. Most of the new production processes for the BMW i4 can  be carried out on the existing bodyshop systems,” Weber explained. Integrating electromobility into series productionThe main difference between the BMW i4 and conventional architectures  is the electric drive and high-voltage battery. About 90 percent of  the existing systems in the Munich bodyshop can still be used for the  new model. Additional ones were required only for the floor assembly  and rear end. Another highly complex topic was the integration into assembly of the  high-voltage battery. The battery pack is now bolted onto the body by  a new, fully automated battery assembly system that works from below.  Fully automated, high-resolution camera systems scan it thoroughly  beforehand to ensure the surface is absolutely clean and there are no  impurities that could cause damage. The BMW Group’s home plant now manufactures an extensive portfolio of  products, comprising not only the BMW i4 but also the  combustion-powered and hybrid BMW 3 Series Sedan and Touring, the BMW  M3 and the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe. The scope of production is a  testament not only to the plant’s flexibility but also to the  outstanding skills of its associates. Digitalisation is progressing Increasing digitalisation plays an important part in BMW Group  production. The whole of Plant Munich is currently being 3D-scanned in  minute detail to obtain a full set of basic digital data of both the  building and its systems. The scans are then processed and saved on  the cloud so the data can be accessed from anywhere using an  intuitive, browser-based tool. Several plants have already been fully  3D-scanned – Spartanburg and Regensburg among them – and Plant  Dingolfing is undergoing the process at the moment. By the end of  2022, the structure of all the major car plants in the BMW Group  production network will have been scanned, and digital data will be  available for everyone. The BMW Group already utilises virtual planning tools to plan  buildings and systems today. Axle pre-assembly for the BMW i4, for  example, was planned with the Omniverse Nucleus platform, by NVIDIA.  This converges data from the design and planning tools of various  producers to create photorealistic real-time simulations in a single  collaborative environment. The data from the 3D scans is also fed into  the Omniverse platform.Other digital applications are used directly in production. Radio  frequency identification (RFID), for example, allows parts to be  identified and assigned contactlessly and automatically along the  value chain, eliminating the need for manual scanning and ensuring the  right one is fitted to the right car. RFID technology is already in  use in seat production but has also made its way into various areas of  vehicle assembly at Plant Munich. The smart labels required for it are  attached to parts while they are still with suppliers or in BMW Group  component production, ready for use in assembly. They are then picked  up by line-side antennae that track every labelled component in every  car. Digitalisation of this kind makes processes faster and more  secure, and enhances efficiency and quality as a result. Reverse osmosis system cuts water consumption by six million litresWithin the production system, the issue of sustainability is of  fundamental importance, and the BMW Group has adopted a holistic  approach to reducing CO2 emissions and minimising the use  of resources. Between 2006 and 2020, resource consumption per car  produced fell more than half, and CO2 emissions have  dropped even further, by 78 percent. The aim is to reduce  CO2 emissions per vehicle produced by another 80 percent by  2030. At Plant Munich some changes have been made and a series of new  measures implemented. That’s why the plant now uses reverse osmosis to  cut freshwater consumption. The system was integrated into production  in the spring of this year and now treats water from the cathodic dip  – where the base coat is applied to vehicles – so it can be re-used  for the same stage of the process. The new system is expected to  reduce total annual freshwater consumption by more than six million  litres. Since 1997, BMW Group Plant Munich has been using groundwater  from its own source on the plant campus. This provides enough to cover  about half of the plant’s annual needs and makes a significant  contribution towards saving valuable drinking water. New sustainability target: zero local emissions from transport    logistics With a particular focus on reducing CO2 emissions, the BMW  Group has also announced another goal to coincide with the production  launch of the BMW i4: over the next few years, local emissions from  transport logistics at Plant Munich will gradually fall to zero. This  will be achieved mainly by making greater use of rail transport and  battery-electric trucks. At the moment more than 750 truck deliveries  are required daily for the delivery of parts. In the future the  inner-city stretches of these journeys will be made by electric  trucks. In addition, the share of vehicles leaving plant Munich by  train will gradually increase from the current 50 percent. The  ultimate aim is to eliminate emissions completely from transport  logistics in the Munich area, but also to bring about significant cuts  within a broader radius and from intercontinental transportation. Peter Weber, Director of BMW Group Plant Munich: “We are well aware  that, owing to the city location of our production facility, we have a  special responsibility. Our project to reduce CO2 emissions  at our home plant will have a major impact that’s positive both for  the environment and for our immediate neighbourhood.” Since last year, all the energy sourced worldwide by the BMW Group  has been green. For production of the BMW i4, for example, the  environmental credentials of green energy were further enhanced by  sourcing it directly from regional hydro-electric power stations.  Furthermore, starting this year, the BMW Group is offsetting its  remaining (Scope 1 + 2) CO2 emissions from production.  These are caused by combined heat and power generation and are fully  offset worldwide with relevant carbon credits. The transformation and future focus of the home plant continueThe integration of the BMW i4 into existing production structures  came at an investment of €200 million. The i4 is an important  trailblazer for the Neue Klasse, due for rollout in Munich and other  plants around the middle of this decade, and designed purely for  electric powertrains. The BMW Group first announced its plans to upgrade Plant Munich for  electromobility less than a year ago: new vehicle assembly and  bodyshop facilities were to be constructed, and engine production was  to relocate to other parts of the production network. Since then,  hundreds of associates have started working at other technologies or  other facilities. By the end of this year, four-cylinder engine  production will have relocated to Hams Hall, UK, and Steyr, Austria.  The relocation of engine production as a whole from Munich will reach  completion by 2024 at the latest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bonovo action BMW Racing Team to line up with Eugene Laverty and Loris Baz in the 2022 WorldSBK.;The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team und BMW Motorrad Motorsport have set the course for the coming season in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). The team will expand its involvement in 2022 and will run two BMW M 1000 RR in the future. In the saddle will be two well-known WorldSBK riders: Eugene Laverty (IRL) and Loris Baz (FRA).;Munich. The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team und BMW Motorrad    Motorsport have set the course for the coming season in the FIM    Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). The team will expand its    involvement in 2022 and will run two BMW M 1000 RR in the future. In    the saddle will be two well-known WorldSBK riders: Eugene Laverty    (IRL) and Loris Baz (FRA). 35-year-old BMW works rider Laverty has been racing in WorldSBK since  2011 and enters his third season with BMW Motorrad Motorsport in 2022.  Baz also comes with plenty of WorldSBK experience: The 28-year-old  Frenchman rode a BMW S 1000 RR in WorldSBK in 2018. Baz made his  Superbike World Championship debut in 2012 and started in the series  for three years, before switching to MotoGP from 2015 to 2017. He then  returned to WorldSBK. In the 2021 season, Baz has been riding in  MotoAmerica but has also impressed on a number of outings in WorldSBK.  His WorldSBK record to date: two wins and 20 podiums. Baz will now be  a BMW works rider in the 2022 season. Jonas Folger (GER), who lined up in WorldSBK with the Bonovo MGM  Racing team in 2021, will be looking for a new challenge after what  has been a difficult season for him. The cooperation in the WorldSBK  has been terminated by mutual consent. Quotes. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: “The Bonovo  action BMW Racing Team is an important part of our WorldSBK project  and we are really looking forward to intensifying the cooperation.  Jürgen Röder’s and Michael Galinski’s team brings a lot of commitment  and passion for motor racing to the FIM Superbike World Championship.  The fact that this BMW team is now expanding and will line up with two  BMW M 1000 RR is an important step for the team and BMW Motorrad  Motorsport’s entire WorldSBK project. The team is well-positioned  coming into the new season, with two factory bikes and BMW works  riders Eugene Laverty and Loris Baz. We are looking forward to tasting  success together in the 2022 WorldSBK!” Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  course is set for a successful second season together for BMW Motorrad  Motorsport and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in the WorldSBK. The  team and we have gained a lot of experience in the first year of our  cooperation, and that now forms the basis as we continue to move  forward together. The two riders starting for the Bonovo action BMW  Racing Team also underline our ambition. We are very pleased that  Eugene Laverty remains a part of the BMW works rider family and lines  up with us in his third season. Although the 2021 season was not  always easy for him, he showed a lot of fight and was very committed  to our project. At the same time, we are pleased to have Loris Baz on  board. Having spent a season on the BMW S 1000 RR in 2018, he is now  part of the BMW works rider family. Loris has more than impressed on  his WorldSBK outings this season. We are confident that, with their  skill and experience, Eugene and Loris will help move the Bonovo  action BMW Racing Team forward. We would like to thank Jonas Folger.  It is a shame that his debut season in WorldSBK did not play out as we  were all hoping. However, he and the team never gave up and always  worked hard. We are very grateful to him for that tireless commitment.” Jürgen Röder, Team Owner Bonovo action BMW Racing Team:  “I am overjoyed that we are heading into the next year as a  strong BMW Team and that two top riders like Eugene Laverty and Loris  Baz will be in the saddle of the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team bikes.  The goal is for the two BMW teams to cooperate even more closely. It  is great for us to have two strong riders on board. Particularly  Eugene, who has been on the BMW for a few years, is an extremely  analytical rider, and provides feedback that can be excellently  incorporated in the further development of the bike. He knows all the  structures at BMW, and who he needs to contact and when, and is  obviously a great addition to the team. I think 28-year-old Loris is a  great young rider. We have seen what he is capable of. He has done  well in MotoAmerica, has returned to World Superbike and has achieved  some very impressive results. It is a real godsend for me to have  someone like him in our team. I think we have a real chance of  consistently finishing in the top ten with both riders next season.  That is obviously a real asset for the whole BMW family. At this  point, I would like to thank Dr. Markus Schramm and Marc Bongers again  for integrating us so closely in the BMW structure. We will do  everything we can to live up to this privilege that has been bestowed  upon us. At the same time, I would like to thank Jonas Folger for his  commitment. He showed great character when came to me and said that he  would not be able to add anything to the team in 2022, and that he  would not be taking up my option of continuing together in WorldSBK. I  find that incredibly impressive. We still have a very good  relationship, and that will remain the case.” Michael Galinski, Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team:  “We are pleased to be able to take this step together with  Jürgen Röder, and are very proud of our two riders. In Eugene Laverty  and Loris Baz we have two excellent riders. Loris has started in many  classes, such as MotoGP and Superbikes, on many different  manufacturers’ bikes, including BMW and Yamaha. He recently showed  what he is capable of at the race in Portugal: two third places as a  reserve rider is no mean feat. We are very pleased to have him on  board. Eugene has been slightly below par this year, as he was unable  to ride for a long time. He is a great development rider and will help  us to develop the bike together with BMW. All in all, we are now on  equal footing with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. They also have two  tall riders on the bike, in Michael van der Mark and Scott Redding.  Loris, as the third tall guy, will be able to contribute to the  development in this regard. Eugene is not quite as tall, but  nevertheless we are all moving in the same direction together. We are  looking forward to the coming season!” Eugene Laverty: “I’m very happy to continue with BMW  Motorrad and join the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team for the 2022 World  Superbike season. It is fantastic to remain in the BMW WorldSBK  family. The past six months have been tough for me as a rider and so  I’m very grateful for the continued support and belief from everyone  involved in this project. I’m very motivated to repay that faith in my  abilities and I feel confident that following a solid winter testing  campaign we can arrive ready and competitive at round one.” Loris Baz: “I am really happy to be back in WorldSBK  so I want to thank BMW and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team for  giving me this opportunity. I think that I have shown during these two  rounds in Spain and Portugal that I have the pace to fight at the  front in this championship. BMW is the brand that grew the most in the  second part of the season. I have closely watched how the bike was  improving. I have been racing with BMW before so I know a lot of  people there and also, I have been competing with MGM Racing for one  race back in 2012. I am really happy and really excited about this  opportunity and am looking forward to trying the bike and to starting  to work together with the team and BMW. Thanks again to all the people  involved in this project.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Junior Team concludes successful NLS season – and looks forward to another highlight this year.;At the start of October, BMW Junior Team completed its first season with a GT3 car on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER). In November, BMW Junior Team heads to the USA, where they will attend both Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta and the 24 Hours of Sebring.;Munich. At the start of October, BMW Junior Team completed its    first season with a GT3 car on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) –    and although a DNF in the final race prevented them from taking the    title, it was still an extremely successful year for Dan Harper    (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA). Two wins and four    podiums in the BMW M6 GT3 earned them second place overall in the    GT3 class and the NLS Speed Trophy. In November, BMW Junior Team    heads to the USA, where they will attend both Petit Le Mans at Road    Atlanta and the 24 Hours of Sebring. Hesse and Verhagen will even    have the opportunity to take part in the Creventic 24H Series race    in a BMW M4 GT3. The rapid development of BMW Junior Team, which started in 2020 in  the BMW M240i Racing and BMW M4 GT4 in the Nürburgring Endurance  Series (NLS), continued seamlessly in 2021 with the BMW M6 GT3, run by  BMW Team RMG. Victories in races four and five of the season on the  Nordschleife, backed up by one second place and a third place in the  second half of the season, are definitive proof that Harper, Hesse and  Verhagen have established themselves among the top GT drivers. Within  a short time, they have gone from promising, talented youngsters to  proven winners. The next step for the BMW Junior Team in 2022 is the  BMW M4 GT3. They will set their sights on overall victory at the  Nürburgring 24 Hours with BMW Motorsport’s new GT3 flagship. The team was given its first taste of the BMW M4 GT3 during tests.  Hesse and Verhagen will now have the opportunity to contest their  first race in this car in November. The whole BMW Junior Team first  travels to Petit Le Mans, the final round of this season’s IMSA  WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Road Atlanta, from where they  head straight to the Creventic 24 Hours of Sebring. Bill Auberlen,  Robby Foley and James Clay (all USA) will be at the wheel of a BMW M4  GT3 there. Alongside this trio, there are still two places available  for drivers with a Silver racing licence. Hesse and Verhagen fall into  this category. As Harper already possesses a Gold licence, he must  wait for his first race outing. However, he will be involved in all  the workflows at the circuit and will also complete a number of test  laps, in order to familiarise himself with both the car and the track. The BMW M8 GTE and BMW M6 GT3 bid farewell at Road Atlanta.BMW Junior Team will witness the farewell appearances of the BMW M8  GTE and BMW M6 GT3 at the IMSA season finale at Road Atlanta. At the  wheel of BMW Team RLL’s two BMW M8 GTEs will be John Edwards (USA),  Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Augusto Farfus (BRA), and Connor De Phillippi  (USA), Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT). Turner Motorsport  will also run a BMW M6 GT3 in the GTD class. Quotes from the BMW Junior Team on the 2021 season: Jochen Neerpasch, mentor to the BMW Junior Team:“BMW Junior Team has developed rapidly. From the BMW M240i Racing and  the BMW M4 GT4 to the BMW M6 GT3, they have only ever needed a few  races to achieve success. In my opinion, that can be traced back to  our team building. As a team, they learn a huge amount from each other  and thus develop faster than other racing drivers who are on their  own. I am sure that the three of them are now capable of winning the  24-hour race at the Nürburgring.” Stefan Reinhold, team principal BMW Team RMG:“For us as a team from the Eifel region, it was obviously fantastic  to finally go racing and taste success on the Nordschleife. In this  regard, the season has been great. We saw at the 24-hour race that our  young drivers can mix it with the best. After that, they have  consistently been among the front-runners, and we have claimed our  first victories. That makes us both happy and proud.” Dan Harper on the NLS season:“Fortunately, we have had more highs than lows this season. We could  never have dreamed that we would still be in contention to win a title  in the final race so we can take a lot of positives from the year. Our  learning curve has been very steep and we have gained valuable  experience, as drivers and a team. That will definitely make us  stronger in the future.” Max Hesse on the NLS season:“We gained an awful lot of experience in the NLS season and have  developed massively as racing drivers and a team. Second place in the  Speed Trophy is a good result, even if it is obviously a shame that we  lost the title due to a crash in the final race.” Max Hesse on his start in Sebring:“The start at Sebring is a superb opportunity for us. Personally, I  have never raced in the USA, so to do that in the new BMW M4 GT3 and  at such an iconic circuit is mega. Hopefully the weather will play  ball and we will have our first full 24-hour race, after the race at  the Nürburgring was cut short.” Neil Verhagen on the NLS season:“I think we can be very proud of what we achieved this season,  despite the unfortunate way it ended. A huge thank you goes to BMW  Team RMG for the fantastic work and support. We have all proved that  we are not only young trainees driving anywhere, but that we belong  among the best. It was not easy to learn everything in our first year  in a GT3 race car, but Dan, Max and I helped each other a lot. We  worked perfectly as the BMW Junior Team.” Neil Verhagen on his start in Sebring:“I cannot describe how excited I am about racing in my home country  in the BMW M4 GT3. I have dreamed of racing in the USA again for  years. My parents will be at Sebring to watch me drive the new BMW M4  GT3. That is going to be a very special experience for me.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Harnessing wind and hydroelectric power from the Arctic Circle: BMW Group plans to source steel produced with green power and hydrogen from northern Sweden; Agreement with Swedish startup H2 Green Steel: first deliveries for Neue Klasse from 2025  Up to 95% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to conventional methods  Delivery to BMW Group plants in Europe  Circular economy: Sheet metal remnants from BMW Group plants will be recycled and reused  Wendt: “Vital contribution to our goal of reducing CO2 emissions in our steel supply chain by about two million tonnes by 2030”  ;Munich. The BMW Group continues to push forward with  climate protection and is systematically pursuing its goal of  significantly reducing CO2 emissions at their source in the  supply chain. From 2025 on, the company plans to source steel produced  with up to 95% less CO2 emissions and without requiring  fossil resources such as coal. The BMW Group has now reached an  agreement to this effect with the Swedish startup H2 Green Steel,  which uses hydrogen and only green power from renewable energies for  steel production. Owing to its particularly energy-intensive  manufacturing process, steel production is considered one of the main  sources of global CO2 emissions.“Our goal is to reduce CO2 emissions in our steel supply  chain by about two million tonnes by 2030. Sourcing steel produced  using hydrogen and green power can make a vital contribution to this,”  says Dr Andreas Wendt, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG  responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network. “Steel is essential  for producing cars and will be no less important for future vehicle  generations. Innovative technologies that enable virtually carbon-free  production of steel have a significant impact on our ability to reduce  CO2 emissions in our steel supply chain.” Closed-loop material cycleIn addition to the  delivery of steel produced using green power, the BMW Group and H2  Green Steel have also agreed to create a closed-loop material cycle.  H2 Green Steel will take back sheet metal remnants, such as those  produced at press plants when doors are punched out, and will process  them in such a way that they can be shipped back to the plants as new  steel rolls, also known as steel coils. In this way, raw materials can  be used multiple times in a circular economy and natural resources  protected. Since it requires less energy to produce, secondary steel  lowers CO2 emissions by an average of 50-80%, compared to  primary material.The BMW Group is already using between 20% and 100% secondary steel  in its vehicles and will continue to increase this percentage in the  future. BMW Group press plants in Europe process more than half a  million tonnes of steel per year. Ideal location in northern Sweden H2 Green Steel is building its steel production site in the province  of Norrbotten in northern Sweden, close to the Arctic Circle. The  region is best known for its reindeer and spectacular northern lights,  but also provides access to high-quality iron ore, plentiful energy  from renewable sources such as hydroelectric and wind power, a major  seaport and generations of steel production know-how.Unlike conventional processes that rely on coke for making steel, the  company employs hydrogen produced using green power to remove the  oxygen from the iron oxide. This so-called direct reduction of iron  ore produces almost no CO2 at all, only water – thereby  avoiding 95% of the CO2 emissions normally produced. The  specially built hydrogen power plant, which uses water and green power  from across the region, will be directly integrated into the steel  production plant. The company also uses local green power for the  remainder of the manufacturing process. BMW Group to source Northvolt battery cells from the same    region from 2024 on Swedish company Northvolt, which develops and produces battery cells  for electric cars, is also exploiting the potential for green power in  the north of Sweden.Last year, the BMW Group signed a long-term battery-cell supply  contract with Northvolt. The battery cells will be produced in Europe  at the Northvolt gigafactory currently under construction in  Skellefteå in northern Sweden from 2024. The company will use only  green electricity from local wind and hydroelectric power to produce  the battery cells. Neue Klasse poised to set new standards From 2025 onwards, the BMW Group will be realigning its product range  – which has grown successfully over decades –on the basis of the Neue  Klasse. The Neue Klasse will be characterised by three key aspects: a  completely redefined IT and software architecture, a new generation of  high-performance electric drive trains and batteries and a radically  new level of sustainability across the entire vehicle lifecycle. These  strands are interwoven within an overall vehicle architecture that has  been uncompromisingly optimised for electric drive trains, setting a  new benchmark in terms of digitisation and electrification, while at  the same time ensuring that the characteristic flair of a typical  BMW is transferred to future vehicle generations. Active commitment to environmental and social standards in the    steel supply chain As part of its involvement with the not-for-profit organisation  ResponsibleSteel, the BMW Group actively participated in establishing  environmental and social standards throughout the entire steel value  chain, starting at the mine. This sustainability standard for  production sites in the steel industry was published in 2019 as part  of a multi-stakeholder process and now forms the basis for  certification. ResponsibleSteel is the steel industry’s first global  multi-stakeholder standard and certification initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Motorrad celebrates world premieres at Milipol 2021 from 19 to 22 October in Paris. ;The new BMW CE 04 as an environmentally friendly authorities vehicle for the city and urban areas.;"Paris. With the new BMW CE 04 and the BMW F 900 XR in  an official version for the police - a cooperation with BMW Motorrad  Netherlands - BMW Motorrad will be celebrating two world premieres at  Milipol 2021 from 19 to 22 October 2021 in Paris. This adds two  superior and forward-looking vehicles to the range alongside the  current police version R 1250 RT, F 750 GS and F 850 GS.The new BMW CE 04 in police version: Future-oriented,    sustainable e-mobility for the city and urban areas.The new CE 04, which was presented a few months ago, plays a  particularly important role, since the dynamic, environmentally  friendly electric scooter not only offers a concept tailored to  special authorities requirements by offering flexible options and a  high level of operational expertise in urban and metropolitan areas.  The new CE 04 is also a forward-looking component of the  sustainability strategy anchored in the BMW Group, in which riding  pleasure goes far beyond simply getting from A to B. Over the past  years and decades, significant standards have already been set in the  BMW vehicle eco balance - starting with the resources used, through  energy consumption, to the share of recycled components.Powerful drive and ample range for authority-suitable use.With a maximum output of 30 kW (41 hp), the new BMW CE 04 features a  powerful motor and offers the best prerequisites for police work in  the city and urban areas. The top speed is 120 km/h - enabling fast  riding not only in the city, but also on motorways and motorway sections.With 60.6 Ah (8.9 kWh), the new BMW CE 04 has an ample battery  cell capacity and provides a range of around 130 kilometres. This  ensures everyday, reliable and emission-free riding in the city as  well as in urban environments.In addition, the authorities version of the new CE 04    also has a number of technical highlights that make riding it    everyday reliable, comfortable and, above all, safe:• Short charge times and charging technology based on the system used  in cars.• Increased riding stability thanks to slip control by means of ASC  (Automatic Stability Control). • DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) as an  ex-works option.• Three riding modes ""ECO"", ""Rain"" and  ""Road"" for efficient, everyday use as standard.• “Dynamic” riding mode for an even sportier riding style as ex works  optional equipment.• Directionally stable suspension and chassis with single-unit  tubular steel main frame.• Powerful braking system with ABS. • Banking-enabled ABS (Automatic  Stability Control) as an ex-works option.• 10.25” TFT colour screen with integrated map navigation and  extensive connectivity as standard.• Powerful LED lighting units all round. Adaptive Turning Light Pro  and light functions as ex-works options.• Wind deflector.• Storage compartments at the side and front.• Customisable ergonomics thanks to a choice of various seats.Special optional equipment for the authorities versions of the    new BMW CE 04:• LED flashing lights front and LED beacon in the rear.• Authorities case.• Siren.• Additional switch for controlling the light and sound signal components.Built at the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin and individually    configurable with special optional equipment.Like the series-production vehicles, the authorities vehicles are  also built at the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin and are integrated into  the series production process.The BMW Motorrad range of optional accessories and optional  equipment ex works, specially tailored to the needs of authorities and  institutions, benefits from decades of experience and development in  this field. Whether for the police, customs, technical aid  organisations, fire brigade, military, escorts or as support for heavy  goods transports - BMW Motorrad is always able to offer tailor-made  authorities vehicles.Accordingly, the new CE 04 as well as the R 1250 RT-P, F 750GS-P  and F 850GS-P in the authority versions can be configured for a wide  variety of uses.The optional equipment is integrated into the vehicle’s series  production and thus guarantees highest-level process reliability and  thus consistently high quality - in contrast to simply putting on  add-ons and integrating conversions or one-off vehicles, as practised elsewhere.BMW Motorrad - the leading manufacturer in the authorities business.For more than 90 years, the authorities business has been an  important and successful field of activity for BMW Motorrad. BMW  Motorrad is the only manufacturer that, in addition to production,  also develops authorities components and carries out the homologation  of the vehicles and authorities equipment itself.Since 1970, more than 160,000 BMW official motorcycles have been  delivered to relevant institutions in over 150 countries around the  world. A figure that impressively underlines the reliability and  versatility of this BMW Motorrad division. In 2019, customers included  public authorities from 31 countries.

San Juan was hosting the penultimate round of the 2021    season in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Van der Mark began Sunday morning’s Superpole race from sixth place.  He fell back a little during the opening laps and was eighth on lap  three, wedged into a tight group. Van der Mark prevailed over his  rivals in the second half of the race, working his way up to fifth and  that was the position in which he crossed the line after ten laps.  Laverty began the Superpole race from twelfth place. He moved up to  tenth after a good start before losing two positions again as the  first lap progressed. He remained in twelfth until the penultimate lap  before slipping back down to fifteenth. In the second main race, van der Mark made a good start and  battled  away in fifth place in the leading group. He was applying pressure on  the riders ahead as he aimed for fourth place. however he lost a place  towards the halfway point of the race and fell back to sixth.  Nonetheless, van der Mark remained in touch but the gap to the top  five stretched out a little on the closing laps. He was never in  danger of losing sixth position before crossing the line after  completing 21 laps. Laverty endured a difficult second main race. He  started from eleventh place and fell back to 17th during the opening  laps. Laverty did gain one position on the penultimate lap, crossing  the line in 16th place. The season finale for the WorldSBK 2021 will take place from 19th to  21st November at the new Mandalika circuit in Indonesia. Quotes after race two at San Juan. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “A great result today from Michael on the BMW M 1000 RR. From  where we started on Friday to where we finished today has been  fantastic hard work from him and his crew and a testament to the steps  that we have taken. We never quite got the chance for the podium today  but a fifth and two sixth-places in the three races is a great reward  for the hard work. To finish eight seconds behind the winner and just  a couple of seconds off the podium in today’s main race just shows how  much improvement we have made with the bike so it was great work by  Mickey and his team. Eugene unfortunately struggled today. In  practice, he and Michael rode together and they swapped places to see  where Eugene had issues but it seems that we could not transfer that  into comfortable settings so Eugene was struggling both in the  Superpole race and in the main race. It is a shame for him as he had  deserved much better results than these. Thanks to Eugene for stepping  in for Tom at the last three rounds. Now we are looking forward to  Tom’s return in Indonesia.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  has been a good Sunday. This morning in warm-up, we tried something  different with the bike but in the end we weren’t really sure so we  went back to yesterday’s set-up. In the Superpole race, I had a good  race, I had fun and enjoyed it a lot. I had some good battles and was  pretty fast, faster than yesterday. It was nice to start from fifth on  the grid for race two. I had an okay start and was in the group  fighting for the podium. To be honest, in the beginning I was  struggling a bit with the full fuel tank. Towards the end of the race  I was alone but I was riding a good pace and it was nice to see what  we can do. I think that it has been an overall good weekend. We take  some good points home and it was nice to be able to fight with the  guys for the podium today in race two but for sure we need to be a  little bit faster.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Altogether, from my side, it has been a very tough weekend.  I struggled to make progress. We changed the bike to improve my  feeling and we never made any major breakthrough. Also in the last  race to finish outside the points after giving my everything over the  entire race was a bitter pill to swallow so I am disappointed with my  performance. All the guys in the team deserved a better result but  unfortunately I wasn’t able to deliver it. Thanks for this great  opportunity to be in the team for these three rounds. I am just  disappointed with myself that I could not do more.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WorldSBK at San Juan: top 6 result for Michael van der Mark in Saturday’s race.;The first race of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) Argentina round ended with a top six result for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Michael van der Mark (NED) completed race one at the ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’ (ARG) in sixth place with his BMW M 1000 RR. Eugene Laverty (IRL) was also on track for the top eight before falling back to 13th position during the closing stage of the race.;San Juan. The first race of the FIM Superbike World    Championship (WorldSBK) Argentina round ended with a top six result    for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Michael van der Mark (NED)    completed race one at the ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’ (ARG) in    sixth place with his BMW M 1000 RR. Eugene Laverty (IRL), standing    in again for Tom Sykes (GBR), was also on track for the top eight    before falling back to 13th position during the closing stage of the    race. San Juan is hosting the penultimate round of the 2021 WorldSBK season. In Superpole on Saturday morning, van der Mark qualified seventh with  Laverty in twelfth. At the start, van der Mark shortly fell back but  soon was back to seventh while Laverty moved up three positions to  exit the first turns in ninth. Laverty then moved up to eighth on lap  five, right behind van der Mark. The two BMW riders remained in those  positions until Laverty fell back to tenth around the halfway point of  the race. Van der Mark closed the gap to the top six and claimed sixth  spot on lap eleven, and that was the position he was in when taking  the chequered flag after 21 laps. Meanwhile, Laverty fought with blunt  weapons and crossed the line in 13th position. Quotes after race one at San Juan. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Today has been a much better day than FP1 and FP2 yesterday.  Both Michael and Eugene have made big steps forward as we expected  from yesterday’s performance. In Superpole, Michael only narrowly  missed out the second row and Eugene did great job to get on the  fourth row in twelfth position from where he had started the weekend  so going into race one, both guys were in a much happier situation. I  think the bikes are very alike in set-up which is something that we  strive towards. Going into the race, both guys felt very comfortable.  Mostly the entire grid selected the same rear tyre, the SCX which  proved to be the only tyre suiting for these conditions. Mickey had a  solid race. From seventh position he battled to sixth. From there he  could not improve position despite the fact that his fastest lap of  the race came at the very end. This showed that we have a good basis  to work on overnight. In the last five or six laps, Mickey was first  or second quickest on track but it just was not possible for him to  further improve from sixth position. It was a great effort from him  today and clearly fourth to sixth is the target for tomorrow. Eugene  just fell back a little bit towards the end of the race. Before, he  was in a good position in a good group of riders but as the fuel load  went down, the balance of his bike changed and he was not that  comfortable anymore. We will work on that for tomorrow. Overall, it  was a not too-bad day. Obviously, we are striving for more but  generally we can say that race one was successful for both riders and  we are looking forward to the Superpole race and race two tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We  have made a big step forward this morning in FP3 compared to  yesterday. I was happier with the bike. We made a small change during  the session and it was alright. Superpole was quite good;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Battery power: BMW Group makes Coldplay world tour more sustainable; BMW & Coldplay unveil mobile show battery power solution for bands upcoming Music Of The Spheres World Tour  World tour achieves a new peak in the long-standing collaboration between the BMW and Coldplay More than 40 recyclable BMW i3 batteries to provide the necessary power during the live performances  Use of the first BMW car batteries rendered suitable for second-life applications  Significant reduction of carbon footprint during world tour thanks to storage technology ;Munich. The collaboration between BMW and Coldplay  will witness a new highlight. Following the successful hit “Higher  Power” synced in the BMW i4/ix purpose film and the British band’s  performance in the virtual world of BMW JOYTOPIA at the IAA Mobility  in Munich, BMW will now provide the world’s first ever mobile,  rechargeable show battery for the bands upcoming Music Of The Spheres  World Tour. In the summer of 2022, the four musicians are also  scheduled to perform in Frankfurt and Berlin.The show battery will provide the necessary electric power during the  live performances with more than 40 recyclable car batteries, making  the series of concerts more sustainable and one of the greenest tours  in music history. The collaboration between BMW and Coldplay sets new  benchmarks and could become the blueprint for the entire live industry.The storage technology for the power supply during the live  performances will be provided by partly recycled BMW i3 batteries. The  show battery will provide the necessary super low emission, electric  power and replace the usual diesel and petrol generators, which will  in turn result in a significant reduction of the carbon footprint of  all the band’s live performances. It will be recharged using a range  of renewable sources including solar installations, a kinetic stadium  floor, power bikes and generators powered by Hydrotreated Vegetable  Oil. The kinetic stadium floor and the power bikes will harness the  collective power of the fans themselves.BMW i3 batteries were the first in the worldwide automotive industry  suitable for second-life use without additional processing. The  technology is an essential part of the BMW Group’s vision of  sustainability and circular economy.“We’re proud to partner with BMW to create the world’s first  tourable, rechargeable show battery – which will allow us to power our  concerts almost entirely from clean, renewable energy”, says  Coldplay’s Chris Martin. ““A common awareness of sustainability has led during recent years to  an intensive, creative co-creation process between BMW and Coldplay,”  emphasises Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President Customer and Brand BMW.  “The campaign song, “Higher Power“, marking the launch of our  all-electric models BMW iX and BMW i4, as well as Coldplay’s  performance at BMWs virtual world of JOYTOPIA during the IAA Mobility,  were the first major highlights of our successful cooperation. With  the use of second-life batteries from BMW i3 vehicles we are now  helping Coldplay’s world tour become even more sustainable.”Collaborative successes: “Higher    Power” and JOYTOPIAThe long-standing collaboration between BMW and Coldplay goes back to  the year 2014. Then, the band featuring Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland,  Will Champion and Guy Berryman played in front of 1,500 enthusiastic  fans, marking the end of their “Ghost Stories Tour” at BMW Welt in  Munich. These initial contacts and the mutual awareness of  sustainability finally resulted in a collaboration between BMW and Coldplay.The campaign for the electric vehicles BMW iX and BMW i4 in June 2021  was the first major success of this collaboration between a brand and  a band. BMW and Coldplay jointly developed the campaign in a unique  co-creation process. The campaign song “Higher Power“ became a massive  hit and the line “This joy is electric” the perfect brand message for  the two new BMW premium models.Sustainable world tour as the blueprint for the entire live    industry  At the IAA Mobility in Munich in September 2021, which was held under  the motto “RE:IMAGINE TODAY” and very much in the spirit of the BMW  Groups vision of sustainability and circular economy, a further major  success of this co-creation was then achieved. BMW’s newly created  Metaverse JOYTOPIA presented an entirely virtual performance by  Coldplay. The musicians’ show could be viewed online for 24 hours and  was seen by more than 150,000 people worldwide. For the digital world,  JOYTOPIA was a quantum leap in terms of marketing and corporate communication This successful collaboration between BMW and Coldplay has now been  further extended, leading to a new climax during next year’s world  tour. As a partner and supplier of recyclable car batteries, BMW will  support the British band not only with achieving the goal of becoming  even more sustainable. The cooperation is a game changer and could  become a blueprint for the entire live industry.https://www.bmw.com/en/automotive-life/coldplay-sustainable-live-music-experience.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loYO_aNqYOI;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW ART MAKERS.  New BMW Group France arts patronage program to support artist-curator duo leading to the completion of a visual art project.;After twenty wonderful years spent supporting photographers and ten years of the BMW Residency, BMW Group France is now reorienting its support for the arts and reinventing its model. While its new program continues to focus on emerging work, experimentation and image-making, the scheme's scope has been broadened to include all visual arts, with a scholarship offered to an artist-curator duo and a budget available for researching and producing works.;"Paris. After twenty wonderful years spent supporting  photographers and ten years of the BMW Residency, BMW Group France is  now reorienting its support for the arts and reinventing its model.  While its new program continues to focus on emerging work,  experimentation and image-making, the scheme's scope has been  broadened to include all visual arts, with a scholarship offered to an  artist-curator duo and a budget available for researching and  producing works.The human-machine relationship, creativity and innovation, support  and commitment are all key BMW Group values. Support is evident in the  patron company's close collaboration with the artists. It works with  them at each step of the way, respects their vision, enables them to  take bold steps, and provides them with the material and financial  resources required to complete their project. Commitment is reflected  in our belief that involvement in cultural patronage a self-evident  step, since it initiates an emotional conversation with our society.  Everything makes sense in this light. A people-focused approach is a  key element of our vision.The freedom to create is equally vital to  artists and BMW as a designer of disruptive innovations for  sustainable and responsible mobility.BMW ART MAKERS: a program supporting experimental and visual    art to see differently. ""In a world full of  uncertainty, BMW ART MAKERS represents an opportunity for emerging  talent in the visual arts world. The program encourages artists to  take an alternative perspective on the major issues facing the modern  world and on key societal challenges. They are given complete freedom  to develop this perspective through experimentation and completion of  a multi-dimensional visual arts project"", comments Vincent  Salimon, CEO of BMW Group France.For 10 years, the BMW Residency, under the remarkable and demanding  artistic direction of François Cheval, has accompanied laureates who  questioned the new practices linked to the history of photography at  the Nicéphore Niépce Museum, and then new techniques and the  relationship to the image at GOBELINS.Today, BMW Group France is now seeking to address the profound  societal change currently taking place. The BMW ART MAKERS new program  supports projects that essentially involve producing images, but also  entail exploration of all contemporary image-making dimensions and  formats (photography, film, video and computer-generated, virtual,  digital images and their presentation to audiences), choosing and  researching media, reproduction techniques, and dissemination networks.BMW ART MAKERS: a scholarship and production budget for an    artist-curator duo seeking to complete a joint artistic  project.Since two brains are better than one, BMW ART  MAKERS is seeking to bring together and support an emerging visual  artist and a curator through its calls for applications for which the  two parties must apply jointly. This partnership draws on the strength  of a strong, like-minded duo to generate the trust and competitive  spirit required for completing a major project from the initial idea  to the end work. The curator is just as important as the artist in  terms of implementing an artistic project and ensuring a concrete  piece of work results from it.This is the first time that a program of this scale offer a curator  support through a visual arts project scholarship alongside an artist.  S/he will perform the role of artistic director, scenographer and  designer, ensuring that the project is completed to the artistic  standards, time frame and budget specified in the call for applications.BMW ART MAKERS: unique mentoring provision from jury  members.Since big ideas need plenty of support to get  off the ground, members of the project selection jury will also act as  mentors during the creative process. BMW Group France would like to  sincerely thank these major figures in the art world for accepting  this role so enthusiastically and ensuring that the project and work  meet the highest standards.The BMW ART MAKERS jury consists of:BMW ART MAKERS: financial and material  support.And since big ideas need to be funded and given  concrete expression, BMW Group France is offering:BMW ART MAKERS:thinking, creating, and most importantly... making things  happen.Research and experimentation are only the  starting points of the artistic project. Once completed, BMW Group  France will promote the project through major international arts  events including the Rencontres d’Arles and Paris Photo.Responding to the call for applications.Duos  can submit their applications between October 8 and December    15, 2021 through the dedicated platform https://bmw-art-makers.plateformecandidature.com/.

BMW Clubs International Council celebrates its 40th anniversary. ;For four decades, the BMW Clubs have been official ambassadors for a distinctive brand image packed with emotion. ;Munich. Over a period of four decades, the BMW Clubs  all over the world have been official ambassadors for the brand. There  are more than 230 000 members in 54 countries on all the continents  suitable for travel with automobiles and motorcycles. The clubs  represented in the BMW Clubs International Council form an  exceptionally large and proactive international association. The  diverse club life of the members of around 700 clubs includes joint  activities, road trips and events. These activities are an expression  of their huge commitment and their strong emotional link with the BMW brand.Communication with the BMW Clubs on an equal footing is extremely  important for the BMW Group. In his congratulations on the  anniversary, Pieter Nota, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG  responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales, highlighted the importance  of the clubs for the living brand experience:“It is my honour to congratulate the BMW Clubs International Council  on its 40th anniversary. Our most valuable customers gather under this  umbrella: loyal enthusiasts of the BMW brand. In the past decades, an  internationally active community has been built with great passion. It  is characterized not only by the exchange of expertise, but also by  friendships developed beyond national borders. On behalf of BMW AG and  my fellow board members, I therefore wish you special congratulations  on the anniversary!”The foundation stone for the umbrella organisation of the BMW Clubs –  the BMW Clubs International Council – was laid at a meeting in Vienna  held in 1981. The Head of the Press Office at that time, Dr Horst  Avenarius, initiated this first step on behalf of BMW. The first  leadership duo comprised Dr Reiner Jodjohn from Germany as Chairman  and Keith Dempster from the USA as his Deputy. Since 2014, David de  Bruyn from South Africa has been President of the Council. Trevor Dean  from Australia, Dr Bernhard Knöchlein from Germany and Julio Reyes  from Guatemala currently provide him with support as Vice-Presidents.The international alignment expanded over the decades and this was  very evident at meetings right from the start with representatives  taking part from many countries including the USA, Canada, the United  Kingdom, Japan, Australia and of course Germany as well.

“Fusion: Motorsport meets SIM racing”: Documentary on the development of the BMW M4 GT3 steering wheel.;A 30-minute documentary describes the development of the first steering wheel in the world that works in both racing cars and simulators.;Munich. BMW M Motorsport and sim racing hardware manufacturer    Fanatec created a world first with the joint development of the    steering wheel for the BMW M4 GT3, which unites real-world and    virtual racing in an unprecedented way. The 30-minute documentary    “Fusion: Motorsport meets SIM racing” describes the pioneering work    in the development of the steering wheel, which works perfectly in    both racing cars and simulators, in detail – from the first idea    viewed with scepticsim, through the initial meetings and various    construction phases, to testing. The documentary is available on BMW    Motorsport YouTube via the following link: https://b.mw/Fanatec_Steering_Wheel.It can also be watched on motorsport.tv, several European,    Asian ans Australian TV channels and on the inflight entertainment    systems of around 130 different airlines – including Lufthansa,    Singapore Airlines and Etihad. The film starts with the world debut of the BMW M4 GT3 steering wheel  at the BMW SIM Live event at BMW Welt in Munich (GER) in December  2020. Getting to the point of BMW works driver Philipp Eng (AUT)  performing a live demonstration of the steering wheel in action in  both a racing car and the simulator was the result of many months of  intensive development – and the time of the major endurance tests on  the racetrack is yet to come. All of the project’s protagonists are given their say in the  documentary, including Head of BMW SIM Racing Rudolf Dittrich and  Fanatec CEO Thomas Jackermeier, as well as the engineers responsible  for the BMW M4 GT3 and the steering wheel, and BMW works drivers and  professional sim racers. Everyone involved creates a very good feel  for the obstacles that needed to be overcome and how well the  collaboration between all the departments had to work to get the  desired end result. When you start the playback you accept the necessary cookies for YouTubePlayer.On our cookie information page you can set or revoke cookies permanently and find more information about our cookie usage.      “With unprecedented collaboration, the BMW M Motorsport and Fanatec  engineers developed a steering wheel like none ever seen before in the  history of racing,” said Dittrich. “They showed courage, pioneering  spirit and creativity, and raised the connection between real-world  motorsport and sim racing to a totally new level in the process. I’d  like to thank everyone involved. I’m delighted that this development  process is being portrayed superbly in this documentary. The film  highlights how seriously BMW SIM Racing takes its 360-degree approach,  and with how much vigour hardware developments and technological  innovations are expedited.” Thomas Jackermeier said: “For Fanatec, the collaboration with BMW M  Motorsport is a bold and important step in the company’s development.  For the first time, we designed a steering wheel that can be used not  only in the sim rig, but also in a real-life racing car. With all our  experience we felt ready for this project, and the tests so far prove  that we have done a good job. Seeing our steering wheel in action for  the first time in the BMW M4 GT3 shakedown gave me goose bumps – and  watching the documentary did as well.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team enters the final phase of the 2021 season in Argentina.;The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team enters the finishing straight in the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in South America. ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’ in San Juan, Argentina, hosts the penultimate event of the season this weekend (15th to 17th October). This is the first of the two overseas events, with which the season draws to a close. The finale will take place from 19th to 21st November in Mandalika, Indonesia.;Munich. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team enters the finishing    straight in the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in    South America. ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’ in San Juan, Argentina,    hosts the penultimate event of the season this weekend (15th to 17th    October). This is the first of the two overseas events, with which    the season draws to a close. The finale will take place from 19th to    21st November in Mandalika, Indonesia. BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’s regular rider Tom Sykes (GBR) is  continuing his recovery following his accident in Barcelona (ESP) and  will not be racing in Argentina. Sykes explained: “I have many things to say and many people to thank  for many reasons and I will do this in the very near future on a  personal level to give more detail. But for now I just need to speak  on behalf of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and I want to say that my  recovery has been incredible and I am at the position to be ready to  go back to my passion that is racing. Unfortunately given the timing  of these back to back races and the fly away in Argentina it just left  us going there with a couple of questions, so unfortunately we had to  make an early decision which meant we have to be out for one more  round. It is hard for me because I have missed more races in the last  four weeks than I have missed in my 21 years of racing. The main thing  is we are looking at the return to racing and look to enjoy the last  round of the WorldSBK championship. Thanks again to all, it is really  appreciated. Tom.” Next to Michael van der Mark (NED), Eugene Laverty (IRL) will again  line up on the BMW M 1000 RR for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team in San  Juan. The province of San Juan is located in the west of Argentina,  roughly 180 kilometres north of Mendoza. With the 4.276-kilometre  ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’, it is one of the country’s motorsport  centres. WorldSBK also visited San Juan in 2018 and 2019. Quotes ahead of the San Juan races. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  successful weekend in Portimão gives us a lot of momentum for the  final phase of the season. The team’s maiden victory in the Superpole  race was just one aspect, as we saw that Michael was also in  contention for a place on the podium in the two main races. We want to  back that up, although we are well aware that different and new  challenges now await us in Argentina and Indonesia. However, we have  confirmed that we are heading in the right direction, and we want to  continue that way. We are sorry that Tom will not be with us in  Argentina, but we fully understand his decision to miss the races.  Health always takes top priority. Our thanks go to Eugene, who is  ready and will stand in for him again in San Juan.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We are pleased to be going back to Argentina for our first  overseas event of the season. We are ready to fight for the podium  again after a successful Portimão event. The team is well prepared.  Once again, due to the recovery of Tom, Eugene will step in at this  event. Hopefully, Eugene can pick up on his positions at Portimão. He  did a very good job there and has a good experience at the San Juan  circuit so he should be ready for the weekend. Mickey came away from  Portugal with strong finishes. I think his confidence is on a high,  the bike is working well for him and he also knows the San Juan  circuit well. So overall, we feel that we are in a good position. It  goes without saying that we really hope that Tom can get back soon and  finish the season with the team. It is a shame that he could not make  it to Argentina but we fully understand the circumstances regarding  being in a fit condition to be able to travel overseas.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Personally I enjoy the San Juan track. It has a bit of  everything, but there are a lot of tight corners, a lot of  combinations and I am looking forward to going there. I think the  organisation and Dorna did a fantastic job to make it happen. It is a  World Championship and it is nice to go overseas and to go to  Argentina. I think that already at Jerez, we started to make steps  with the bike with some different set-up and we did a similar thing in  Portimão which worked out really well. We were a bit unlucky with the  crash in race one and a mechanical problem in race two but it seems  that with the change we made on the bike, we can be really more  competitive. It is always a question mark how it will go on a  different track but at least we go there with a lot of confidence and  knowing we can try a lot more things with the set-up now.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Firstly  I must say a big well done to Dorna and all the teams for making this  Argentinian round happen. This is the first time that we’ve travelled  outside of Europe since the global pandemic really took hold 18 months  ago and that’s a sure sign of progress. I really enjoy the Villicum  circuit layout and I’ve enjoyed good results here in previous years.  We made progress last time out at Portimão finishing in the top 10 in  all three races and slowly but surely the bike is beginning to feel  more like my bike. We’ll continue working on the chassis set-up to  improve braking and turning during Friday practice as we aim to make  another step closer towards fighting for that top 6 this weekend.”  Track Facts San Juan.Circuit        length4.276          km – anti-clockwiseCorners17 – 7 right-handers, 10 left-handersPole        positionRightLongest        straightApprox. 850 metresGrip levelExtremely lowTrack        layoutMainly slow corners, stop&go characterStrain on        brakesMediumAmount at full        throttle29 %Top speed / lowest        speed312          km/h / 61 km/hBest overtaking        opportunityT10, T15Key        factorsConfidence in the bike, engine performance,          brake stability;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW M Motorsport News, 12th October 2021.;BMW M Motorsport teams are once again in action all over the world in 2021. They are challenging for race wins and titles with the BMW M6 GT3, the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW M2 CS Racing, and other BMW M Motorsport race cars. Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you an overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams.;GTWC: Premiere for the new BMW M4 GT3 at Barcelona. Premiere for the new BMW M4 GT3 in the Fanatec GT World Challenge  Europe Endurance Cup: the new GT flagship made its first appearance in  the series as a guest starter at the season finale at Barcelona, where  it completed another important test under race conditions. The #82 BMW  M4 GT3 was driven by Philipp Eng (AUT), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Jesse  Krohn (FIN). After three hours of racing, the trio crossed the finish  line in 16th place. “It was an interesting weekend, at which we learned an awful lot  about the car,” said Eng. “We were able to focus fully on the  performance set-up. In Barcelona, it was all about fine-tuning the car  for qualifying and the long run in the race in one of the toughest GT3  racing series in the world. We gained a lot of knowledge and can now  build on the performances. The whole team worked extremely hard and it  was once again great fun to drive the BMW M4 GT3.” “It has been another good run with the BMW M4 GT3,” said Farfus. “We  are very pleased with the mileage and with the first face-to-face  comparison against the other GT3s. This showed us that we are going  into the right direction but also gave us very good indications what  needs to be improved and where we need to work on the car. It was  great to see the GTWC, to see how strong the field is and also to see  the last show of the BMW M6 GT3. Next year, we will be racing with the  BMW M4 GT3 and I am sure that it will be a very successful car.” Krohn  added: “It was really exciting to finally drive the BMW M4 GT3 in race  conditions. I think overall the weekend was a success. We have taken  some steps forward with the car and we showed a little of the  potential of the BMW M4 GT3. Now I am really looking forward to the  next race and I think we can still take some more good steps and  improve the car even further.” The three-hour race at Barcelona also saw the BMW M6 GT3 bid farewell  to the series. However, it proved to be a tough weekend for the BMW M  Motorsport teams. David Pittard, Jake Dennis and Nick Yelloly (all  GBR) finished 21st in the #34 Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M6 GT3. Their  team-mates Martin Tomczyk (GER), Thomas Neubauer (FRA) and Nick  Catsburg (NED) failed to finish in the #35 car. In the Pro-Am class,  Boutsen Ginion battled their way to tenth place in the #10 BMW M6 GT3,  after the car had been forced into a gravel bed by a rival. Jens  Klingmann, Jens Liebhauser (both GER) and Karim Ojjeh (KSA) alternated  at the wheel for Boutsen Ginion.  --Nürburgring Endurance Series: Danny Brink and Philipp Leisen    remain champions.In a dramatic finale on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), BMW  drivers Danny Brink and Philipp Leisen (both GER) successfully  defended the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) title. The two  Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive drivers, competing in the  V4 class in the #1 BMW 325i, arrived at the ninth and final round of  the 2021 NLS season as championship leaders. Their closest rivals in  the title race were unable to catch them the final race, which was  reduced to three hours and 15 minutes due to fog. So Brink and Leisen,  who also took the class victory in the V4 category alongside  Christopher Rink (GER) at NLS 9, secured their third title in the  overall NLS classification, having previously been crowned champions  in 2018 and 2020. Brink and Leisen also topped the table in the NLS Production Car  Trophy, as well as winning the V4 championship together with Rink.  Rink also competed with Philipp Stahlschmidt and Daniel Zils (both  GER) in the #481 BMW 330i of Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner  Automotive in the large VT2 field. That trio also came into the  weekend with a good chance of winning the title in the VT2 class. A  puncture, however, meant they eventually had to settle for fifth place  in the class in the final race of the season. That was not enough to  give them the overall title, but Rink, Stahlschmidt and Zils did end  the season at the top of the VT2 class. The race win in the VT2  category went to the AVIA Sorg Rennsport team with the #487 BMW 330i,  driven by Moran Gott, Brett Lidsey (both GBR) and Emir Asari (TUR). Also competing in the VT2 class at NLS 9 was Markus Flasch (AUT), CEO  of BMW M GmbH. He shared the #482 BMW 330i, run by Adrenalin  Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive, with Jacob Erlbacher (GER). They  ended the race ninth in class. In the Cup5 class, the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup NLS, this season’s  champions are Marc Ehret, Moritz Oberheim and Nico Otto (all GER).  After a winning run in the #875 BMW M2 CS Racing of FK Performance  Motorsport, second place in class in the final race was sufficient to  secure the title. The race win in the Cup5 class went to Francesco  Merlini (ITA), Yannick Fübrich (GER) and David Griessner (AUT) in the  #870 car of Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive. Florian  Weber, Davide Dehren (both GER) and Matthew Greenwood (GBR) finished  third in the #888 Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M2 CS Racing. The title  in the BMW M240i class was won by Michael Fischer (AUT). He also  picked up another class victory in the final race of the season,  alongside Markus Fischer (AUT) in the #700 BMW M240i Racing run by the  Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport team. Meanwhile, the BMW Junior Team was unfortunate in the final race of  the season. After two wins and a further two podiums, Dan Harper  (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) also challenged for the  podium with the #44 BMW M6 GT3 at NLS 9 but they were forced to retire  from the race after being hit by another car. Harper, Hesse and  Verhagen ended the season in second place in the SP9 Pro class. They  were also second in the NLS Speed Trophy. --IMSA: Success and misfortune for Turner Motorsport in Virginia. The penultimate event of the 2021 IMSA series led the Turner  Motorsport team to the VIRginia International Raceway (USA). It was  another eventful weekend for Will Turner’s (USA) team. Saturday’s race  in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship ended in dramatic  fashion. Robby Foley and Bill Auberlen (both USA) were leading the GTD  class in the #96 BMW M6 GT3 and were on course for victory when they  were hit by a GTLM car. That resulted in a puncture, forcing Auberlen  to come into the pits for a tyre change. They eventually crossed the  finish line in 12th place. That was followed by a successful qualifying for the race in the IMSA  Michelin Pilot Challenge, in which Dillon Machavern (USA) secured pole  position for the team’s #95 BMW M4 GT4, which he shared with Auberlen.  Machavern led the field for the first half of Sunday’s two-hour race.  After two full course yellow periods, which made the pit stop strategy  a lottery, the #95 had fallen well down the field, but Auberlen  launched one of his famous fightbacks. He finished fourth, but was  subsequently promoted to third place and a spot on the podium when a  rival was disqualified. The #96 BMW M4 GT4, driven by Foley and  Vincent Barletta (USA), came home eleventh. Machavern and Auberlen  lead the GS class going into the final round which takes place on 12th  November at Road Atlanta (USA). --Italian GT: Class victory for BMW Team Italia in the sprint    finale at Mugello. In the Italian GT Championship, Mugello (ITA) hosted the final two  sprint races of the season at the weekend. In Saturday’s opening race,  Stefano Comandini (ITA) and Marius Zug (GER) finished an impressive  fourth overall in the #7 BMW M6 GT3 of BMW Team Italia. That was  enough to earn them third place in the GT3 PRO class. In the second  sprint race on Sunday, the #7 BMW M6 GT3 was on course for the overall  podium. However, with roughly a quarter of an hour remaining,  Comandini was hit and spun by another car. Comandini was initially  able to continue, but then had to give up. The BMW Team Italia GT4 drivers, Nicola Neri and Giuseppe Fascicolo  (both ITA), took victory in the GT4-AM class on Saturday at the wheel  of the #215 BMW M4 GT4. In Sunday’s race, they finished runner-up in  their class. --GT4 European Series: Podium for Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport at    the Barcelona finale. Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya (ESP) hosted the final round of this  season’s GT4 European Series at the weekend. The big field of 41 cars  included three BMW M4 GT4s. In Saturday’s opening race, Cem Bölükbasi  and Berkay Besler (both TUR) finished an impressive third overall in  the #12 BMW M4 GT4 run by Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport. That also  earned them second place in the Silver class. In race two on Sunday,  the duo was unfortunate and missed out on another top result. Their  team-mates Hasan Tansu and Yagiz Gedik (both TUR) ended race one in  seventh place in the PAM class in the #11 BMW M4 GT4, before failing  to finish race two. In the AM class, Paolo Meloni (SMR) and  Massimiliano Tresoldi (ITA) finished fourth in both races for the  W&D Racing Team in the #50 BMW M4 GT4. --BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Italy: Gustavo Sandrucci crowned champion. The 2021 champion in the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Italy is Gustavo  Sandrucci (ITA). At the season finale in Mugello (ITA), Sandrucci once  again showed all his skill in the #16 BMW M2 CS Racing to take victory  in both races. After six events, Sandrucci wrapped up the title with  181 points. Second overall was Luigi Ferrara (ITA) with 138 points,  followed by Filippo Maria Zanin (ITA) with 118 points. Sandrucci won both the final two races in very close finishes. In  race one, he was followed over the finish line by Marco Zanasi (ITA)  in second place and Ferrara in third. In race two, second place went  to Jody Simone Vullo (MON) and third to Zanasi. --BTCC: Win number 60 for Colin Turkington. Colin Turkington (GBR) once again showed his class at the ninth and  penultimate race weekend of the British Touring Car Championship  (BTCC) at Donington Park (GBR). At the wheel of the #2 BMW 330i M  Sport, he claimed his 60th BTCC victory in total. Having  finished fifth and eleventh in the first two races, Turkington started  race three from pole position and took full advantage of the ideal  starting position. He drove the perfect race, set the fastest lap, and  secured the victory. Turkington climbed into second place in the  championship on the back of his latest success. He now trails the  leader by 32 points, with a total of 67 points still up for grabs at  the Brands Hatch finale in two weeks’ time. BMW holds a significant  lead at the top of the Manufacturer standings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Motorsport fans in the full grandstands and packed    paddock were treated to a feast of action both on and off the track,    and BMW M Motorsport played a major role. As well as bidding    farewell to the BMW M6 GT3 from the DTM, the spotlight was also on    the title deciders in the BMW M2 Cup and the DTM Trophy. The    historic BMW M Motorsport endurance legends also provided some very    special eye candy. DTM: Marco Wittmann ends the year fourth overall in the BMW M6    GT3’s farewell season.It was a visibly happy Marco Wittmann (GER) who emerged from the  Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M6 GT3 after the 16th and final race of the  DTM season. Seventh place in his home race at the Norisring was a  successful end to what has, on the whole, been an extremely successful  season. He finished fourth in the championship, with 171 points, two  wins, two pole positions and five podiums to his name. “Finishing  seventh was a satisfactory way to end the season. We were not  expecting that before the race, so I am really happy,” said Wittmann.  “I can be particularly pleased with fourth place overall in the  championship. For me, the highs and the victories this season  definitely outweigh anything else. The performances we gave this year  were huge.” As well as Wittmann, ROWE Racing drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)  and Timo Glock (GER) also raced in the DTM in the farewell season for  the BMW M6 GT3, which will be replaced by the new BMW M4 GT4 in 2022.  They finished eleventh and 17th in the Drivers’ Championship. BMW M2 Cup: Inaugural season a total success.The BMW M2 Cup crowned the champion of its inaugural season at the  Norisring. Louis Henkefend (GER) won three races and scored a total of  177 points in the #17 BMW M2 CS Racing. “I am incredibly happy! That  is a big load off my mind,” said Henkefend. “Thank you to everyone who  has supported me throughout the years. This title means an awful lot  to me.” The goal of the BMW M2 Cup is to offer talented young drivers the  opportunity to prove themselves and go head-to-head on a big stage in  identical cars at the highest technological level. This goal was well  and truly achieved. “It was fantastic to be there live at the  Norisring for the finale of this season’s BMW M2 Cup, and to  experience the magnificent atmosphere in Nuremberg. That is motorsport  at its best,” said Thomas Felbermair, Vice President Sales and  Marketing BMW M GmbH. “Congratulations to Louis Henkefend on winning  the Driver title in the inaugural season of our new one-make cup with  the BMW M2 CS Racing. His consistently strong displays make him a  worthy champion. It was a great pleasure to see him and all the other  drivers racing against each other at such a high level over the course  of the season. The performances of the many talented young racers are  confirmation that we were spot on with the alignment of our BMW M2  Cup. Thank you to tolimit for organising and implementing the racing  season, as well as all the partners for their support. I can hardly  wait for the second season next year.” DTM Trophy: Ben Green wins title showdown in the BMW M4 GT4.Britain’s Ben Green, in a BMW M4 GT4 run by FK Performance  Motorsport, won the title in the DTM Trophy in a truly nail-biting  finale. He led his closest rival William Tregurtha (GBR, Mercedes) by  just six points going into the final race on Sunday. Fittingly, the  two title contenders ended up battling it out amongst themselves for  the race win and with it the title. It was Green who eventually  emerged triumphant, winning the race and defending the top spot in the  overall standings. In total, Green won five races over the course of  the season. Michael Schrey and Theo Oeverhaus (both GER) each one won  race in the BMW M4 GT4. They ended the season fifth and sixth in the  Drivers’ Championship. FK Performance Motorsport also won the Team  title with 268 points. In the Manufacturers Championship, BMW was  victorious with 302 points. BMW M Motorsport endurance legends thrill the crowds.One of the biggest favourites with the crowds in the Norisring  paddock were the BMW M Motorsport endurance legends. BMW Group Classic  presented some of the most spectacular and iconic BMW race cars,  offering a taste of things to come when BMW M Motorsport enters the  LMDh class from the 2023 season. Fans were able to admire and watch  the following cars in action as they took to the track for a number of  show runs: a replica of the 1973 BMW 3.0 CSL, the BMW M1 ‘Münchner  Wirte’ from 1981, the 1992 BMW M3 E30, the BMW McLaren F1 GTR Long  Tail from 1997, the BMW V12 LMR from 1999, and the 2015 BMW Z4 GT3. At  the wheel of the cars were Peter Oberndorfer (GER), Prinz Leopold von  Bayern (GER), Johnny Cecotto (VEN), Peter Kox (NED), Marc Hessel  (GER), Bruno Spengler (CAN) and BMW M Managing Director Markus Flasch. “It was fantastic to be back at the Norisring after two years, and to  see the fantastic fans, some of whom had come here specially to meet  me,” said Spengler. “It was very special to drive the BMW Z4 GT3, with  which I contested the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps alongside Alex  Zanardi and Timo Glock in 2015, in front of this great backdrop. That  is a really cool car, which is great fun to drive.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the meantime, van Meel has also been,  inter alia, responsible for the Rolls-Royce product line as well as  for the BMW luxury and upper class. Under his leadership, the BMW  Group’s new technology flagship, the BMW iX, was brought to  series-production readiness. Van Meel also headed development of the  forthcoming purely electrically powered model variants. With this  experience in hand, he brings along the ideal prerequisites to also  shape the next stages already commenced on the way to electrification  at the BMW M GmbH. The first highlight of van Meel’s second term of  office has already been fixed: 2022 will witness the celebrations  marking the 50th anniversary of the company - originally founded as  BMW Motorsport GmbH - during which many new high-performance  automobiles will be presented. These will also include the first BMW  M3 Touring, which is already in an advanced stage of its series  development process.During the past three years, BMW M GmbH has been influenced by an  unparalleled model offensive. The list of innovations with which BMW M  GmbH was able to achieve new record sales figures and assume market  leadership ahead of competitors included the extended range of  performance automobiles and new versions of the model series BMW M3  and BMW M4, which represent the core of the BMW M brand, as well as  the absolute top-of-the-range models in their segment, the BMW M2 CS  (fuel consumption combined: 10.1 – 9.2 l/100 km according to WLTP;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW M 1000 RR wins finale in Most: BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team celebrates maiden victory in the FIM EWC.;The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team has made it onto the top step of the podium in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC). The team celebrated its first victory in the FIM EWC at the 2021 finale, the six-hour race in Most (CZE). After a breathtaking finish, the #37 BMW M 1000 RR crossed the finish line first to take the win. Victory secured second place in the championship standings in the 2021 FIM EWC for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team.;Most. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team has made it onto    the top step of the podium in the FIM Endurance World Championship    (FIM EWC). The team celebrated its first victory in the FIM EWC at    the final round of the 2021 season, the six-hour race in Most (CZE).    After a breathtaking finish, the #37 BMW M 1000 RR crossed the    finish line first to take the win. Alternating in the saddle were    Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Markus Reiterberger (GER). Kenny Foray    (FRA) was on standby as the third rider. Victory secured second    place in the championship standings in the 2021 FIM EWC for the BMW    Motorrad World Endurance Team.  Success in the FIM EWC came just one week after the first victory in  the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) for the BMW Motorrad  WorldSBK Team. Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Foray qualified second to  secure a good start position for the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. The turmoil at the start initially saw Mikhalchik drop back to sixth  place, however he was soon able to work his way back towards the front  of the field through a combination of speed and skill. After 15  minutes of racing, Mikhalchik was running second. Shortly after that,  he moved to the head of the field on the #37 BMW M 1000 RR and set  about opening a lead. Over the course of the race, which included two  lengthy safety car periods, he and Reiterberger only surrendered the  lead briefly twice. With a strong performance from the two riders, a  smart strategy and a perfect BMW M 1000 RR, the team led for almost  the entire race. Having said that, the closing stages were not for the faint-hearted.  The #7 Yamaha from the YART team was closing all the time, however  Reiterberger kept a cool head, used all his skill, paced the race  perfectly and defended the lead to take the team’s maiden victory.  After six hours of racing, and a real thriller, he took the chequered  flag with a lead of just 0.070 seconds. 2021 was the second season in the FIM EWC for the BMW Motorrad World  Endurance Team. The new BMW M 1000 RR was used for the first time this  year. The team finished third in the first two races, at Le Mans (FRA)  and Estoril (POR). In race three, the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet (FRA),  they were forced to retire with a technical issue. The acclaimed  maiden victory came just a few weeks later in Most.  Quotes after the race at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Congratulations to the team, Werner Daemen and the riders on  their fantastic victory in Most. The race was a thriller, just as the  whole season has been extremely exciting. We have experienced  impressive fightbacks, podiums and setbacks this year. After the Bol  d’Or, we were no longer in contention for the title, however it was  clear that the team would give it their all in the final race here in  Most. We looked very good in the test and backed that form up in the  race. We knew that we had the pace to finish on the podium. To take  victory at the end of such a close race is simply fantastic. It was a  fantastic job from Ilya and Reiti, who was so impressive in bringing  home the win, and the whole team, which worked perfectly in the  garage. That is a great way to end the season. We will keep working  and know that we still have a lot of challenges ahead of us. However,  this is a great basis, we have a superb team, and we now head into the  winter and preparations for 2022 with great motivation.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “I am overjoyed. This weekend has been perfect from the word  go. Together with the YART team, we were always first and second, in  all the practice sessions and qualifying. To win the race by 0.07  seconds after six hours of racing is a dream. It is simply excellent,  and I know how much work we have all invested in this success. Despite  the races at Le Mans and Estoril not running entirely smoothly, we  still finished on the podium. We then retired with a technical issue  in the Bol d’Or, but these things can happen. Despite this, we still  managed to finish the season in second place in the championship. I am  proud of our riders and I am proud of the fact that we have taken all  those involved and formed a team capable of challenging for the championship.” Markus Reiterberger: “I think that was a really  breathtaking race to the chequered flag. Ilya was on the bike at the  start. He overtook everyone in the first stint and we took the lead.  We fancied a five-stop strategy, but for that to work you need a  safety car. That is very probable at this track, and that is exactly  what happened. We managed to make one stop fewer than YART, for  example. I think fuel consumption was the key to success today, and  the fact that we rode flawlessly. I gave it everything in my last  stint and rode against the clock. That was very tough, because Marvin  Fritz was really pushing behind me. It was really very close, but I  did it. I am grateful that we have finally won, as the whole team has  more than earned it. This is the reward for the huge amount of hard  work. Thank you to the team, BMW and everyone who has supported us.  This is a really nice way to end the season.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am so happy. We got our first win  and it’s really an amazing feeling, especially after the bad luck we  had at the Bol d’Or. Now we are also second in the world championship  and this gives us extra motivation. The race was almost perfect  because in the last two hours I was nearly 30 minutes behind the  safety car and afterwards I was struggling a bit with the tyres and it  was not easy to get back to a fast pace. In the last 50 minutes Markus  did a great job. He rode a really fast pace. We won the race, even if  it was with a very small gap. It is an amazing feeling and I want to  say thank you to the entire team, to my family, everyone – I am just happy.” Kenny Foray: “It was a fantastic race from my  team-mates and from my team. I came here on Monday, I did not know the  track and my job was just to help the team whenever there is a  problem. Of course, I would have liked to ride in the race, but my  team-mates did a fantastic job. I am really happy for them, for the  team and for BMW. The first win is a great result for us. I am also  happy because I rode three races this season and we finished second in  the world championship and it is always great to end a season like  this. So a big thank you goes to my team.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Imagining the cooperation of the future: BMW Group creates flexible working environments with ConnectedWorks. ; The BMW Group is developing new working environments for around 70,000 associates worldwide  Flexible working enables a modern work-life balance  Working on-site remains a key success factor  ;Munich, 8 October 2021 – Flexible, individual,  sustainable – that is how BMW Group working environments will be  organised. The company is gradually developing a future-oriented  working environment for about 70,000 associates worldwide in around  400 office buildings in more than 40 countries. Under the name  ConnectedWorks, the BMW Group is continuing a process it began back in  2017: For example, at the Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ) in  Munich, new working models are being created that offer every team a  variety of options for combining digital, location-independent formats  with flexible, individually configured forms of on-site cooperation.  The aim is always to achieve the best work results.Experience during the coronavirus pandemic has shown that the BMW  Group is on the right track. Speed and location independence have  proved to be important attributes of digital remote working – but they  cannot replace personal exchange between colleagues. It also became  clear during the challenges of the coronavirus, that innovations, team  creativity and a feeling of belonging develop best on-site. Now that  more in-person meetings and professional exchange are possible again,  the challenge lies in combining the best of both worlds. For the BMW  Group, the question of how to work together on the future of mobility  is not just about how many days people work in the office or at other  locations. It is about much more than that: The central idea is how  BMW Group associates can perform complex integrated tasks to the best  of their abilities.                   One element of this is mobile working. Thanks to this development,  associates have been able to organise their day-to-day work flexibly  in agreement with their managers since 2013 – making the BMW Group a  leader for the whole industry. “Ideas and innovations mainly come from  personal exchange. That is why attractive working environments are a  key success factor for us – complemented by hybrid and digital  cooperation models,” says Ilka Horstmeier, member of the Board of  Management of BMW AG responsible for Human Resources. ConnnectedWorks supports modern vehicle development What this might look like in practice can be seen in the working  environments at the FIZ in Munich, the heart of the BMW Group’s  research and development network. Today’s modern vehicle development  is a complex, integrated activity. For several years now, the BMW  Group has been committed to bringing together associates from  different areas of the company to work together in interdisciplinary,  cross-functional teams. More than 22,000 associates currently work at  FIZ under one roof. Interaction is encouraged: Newly designed team  spaces facilitate communication and enable staff from different  disciplines to work together. Short lines of communication, with  low-threshold, cross-cutting opportunities for interaction create a  space for innovation at the FIZ Tech Campus. Working together on-site  and in-person is crucial – and the rapid growth in digital formats  makes places for collaboration increasingly important. The BMW Group’s  workplace strategy therefore deliberately focuses on the layout and  providing a place that facilitates collaboration and idea-sharing.  More than 30% of office spaces worldwide have already been converted.  Alongside team spaces that encourage communication and interaction,  there are also spaces associates can retreat to for concentrated  working, as well as areas where they can recuperate and connect. In  this way, the BMW Group is reinforcing its sustainable area  management, while helping associates achieve optimal work results and  strengthening its corporate culture. The flexible working environments  are supplemented by seamless integration of digital options for  location-independent cooperation.In the future, office spaces will be geared even more towards  associates’ needs. For instance, the IT Centre project at the Munich  location was supported by associates as part of an analysis of working  methods. This analysis phase is central to implementation of the  workplace strategy. The information obtained forms the basis for the  planning and implementation phase. In this way, the BMW Group is able  to ensure spaces are optimally tailored to the needs of each business  department and their work demands. It is all about offering associates  the perfect environment for their job and preferred method of working. Learning from and with one anotherConnectedWorks is not a rigid concept;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Motorrad is all set for the 20th BMW Motorrad Days. ;They will be held on 2 and 3 of July 2022 in Berlin for the first time and directly following the Pure&Crafted Festival.;"Munich. For almost two decades now, attending the BMW  Motorrad Days has been a must for motorcycle fans from all over the  world. Visitors from countries such as the USA, Japan or Australia,  sports, touring and enduro riders, customizing freaks or motorsports  enthusiasts will all find their personal highlight to feel great and  have loads of fun at the BMW Motorrad Days.Following a two-year break - caused by the Covid 19 pandemic -  BMW Motorrad invites fans and friends of the brand to the BMW Motorrad  Days again on 2 and 3 July 2022. This time the location will be in the  Summer Garden of the Messe Berlin trade fair grounds. The event will  immediately follow the Pure&Crafted Festival, which will take  place on 1 July 2022 at the same location and for which BMW Motorrad  is once again the initiator and title sponsor.Currently, the fourth edition of the Berlin Pure&Crafted  Festival held on 17 and 18 September 2021 has already impressively  shown that the new location in the heart of City-West has what it  takes not only to become the permanent new home for the  Pure&Crafted Festival, but at the same time also offers perfect  conditions for the BMW Motorrad Days.Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: ""The new concept  is based on establishing a long-term presence at the BMW’s Berlin  plant location with the BMW Motorrad Days. We can make use of the  synergies with the already well-known and proven Pure&Crafted  Festival. However, they will continue to be two separate and  independent events: BMW Motorrad is a partner and sponsor of the  Pure&Crafted Festival, while we host the BMW Motorrad Days, the  brand's biggest customer event worldwide, ourselves.""On the first weekend of July next year, Pure&Crafted will  offer its magic, charm and special moments to visitors already on  Friday. As a unique event, the festival will thrill everyone attending  with a distinctive mix of live music, motorcycle culture and new  heritage lifestyle before the BMW Motorrad Days take the reins on  Saturday and Sunday.Lasting two days, the gathering will once again be dedicated  entirely to the international BMW Motorrad fan community and riding  fun on two wheels.

Sandra Mujinga is the winner of the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2021.  BMW as long-term partner of Germany’s most prestigious contemporary art award.;On the evening of October 7, 2021 the winner of the Preis der Nationalgalerie was announced at Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin. Celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, the BMW Group Cultural Engagement supports the Preis der Nationalgalerie for over 15 years now.  ;Berlin. On the evening of October 7, 2021, the winner  of the Preis der Nationalgalerie was announced at Hamburger Bahnhof –  Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin. Celebrating its 50th anniversary this  year, the BMW Group Cultural Engagement supports the Preis der  Nationalgalerie for over 15 years now.The jury, consisting of Emre Baykal, chief curator,  Arter, Istanbul; Emma Lavigne, president, Palais de Tokyo,  Paris and Yesomi Umolu, director curatorial affairs  and public practice, Serpentine Galleries, London, decided after  intense discussions on Sandra Mujinga (born 1989 in Goma, Democratic  Republic of the Congo) as the prize winner. With the award Mujinga  wins a major solo exhibition next year in one of the Nationalgalerie’s  institutions as well as an accompanying publication.“The jury has decided to award this year’s Preis der Nationalgalerie  to Sandra Mujinga. Sandra Mujinga works across a variety of media,  with her presentation at Hamburger Bahnhof placing a focus on her  sculptural practice. On the one hand, the works display a great  sensibility for craft and materiality. Yet, with them, Mujinga is also  able to reconcile contradictory experiences: ostensibly familiar forms  disappear before we are able to grasp them; her spectral figures  appear ominous, but also seem to offer their protection; although  static, they exhibit an inherent dynamism;" and they are both finished,  but also seemingly in a state of becoming. Her negotiation of these  contradictions opens up a space for imagination on the part of the  viewer. The topics addressed by her works resonate greatly with the  present moment, while also seeming to come from a future already  passed. They remind us to be considerate of other living beings for  the sake of our own survival, and that we can observe and learn from  their various strategies of adapting to an ever-changing world”,    stated the jury in its unanimous decision.“Since 2013, after being awarded the Preis der Nationalgalerie,  Marianna Castillo Deball, Anne Imhof, Agnieszka Polska, and Pauline  Curnier Jardin have come up with incredibly impressive presentations  for the Hamburger Bahnhof. I would like to give my sincerest thanks to  the members of the jury for today’s lively discussion and congratulate  Sandra Mujinga, whose exhibition we will now spend the coming year  preparing,” stated Dr Gabriele Knapstein, head of Hamburger    Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin.Dr Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,  Finance, said about the newly announced winner, “Looking at  past nominees and their later careers, the significance of the  shortlist has become very clear. As long-standing partner, we would  like to warmly congratulate Sandra Mujinga as this year’s winner. We  are very much looking forward to her upcoming exhibition.”In addition to Sandra Mujinga, the shortlisted artists for this  year’s Preis der Nationalgalerie included Calla Henkel & Max  Pitegoff, Sung Tieu and Lamin Fofana. Their works will be presented as  part of a group exhibition at Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart  – Berlin until February 27, 2022. During this period, visitors will be  given the opportunity to vote for their favorite at www.tip-berlin.de.  Following the exhibition of the shortlisted artists, all votes will be  counted and the winner of the audience award will be announced. Among  all participants tipBerlin raffles one of the limited BMW Art Car  miniatures of the 1975 designed BMW Art Car by Alexander Calder. With  his design for the BMW 3.0 CSL, the artist laid the foundation for  what is today internationally known as the BMW Art Car Collection.After the award ceremony, more than 250 international guests and  friends of the Nationalgalerie celebrated the winner Sandra Mujinga  with the longstanding partner BMW.The Preis der Nationalgalerie was founded in 2000 by Freunde der  Nationalgalerie and supported by BMW as exclusive partner for 15 years  now.

Of course, it would have  been great to be on pole position but the guys from YART have also  been very fast and we are also happy with second place. Everything is  well prepared for the race and and we will aim for the win.” Markus Reiterberger: “So far, the days here in Most  have been really good, and the qualifying sessions also went very  well. We set the fastest qualifying lap of the entire field, which is  something I am very proud of. We have consistently improved the bike,  which is now in very good condition, both for a flying lap and over  the full race distance. I really like the track in Most. It is very  cool, but the conditions are superb for fast laps. We are excellently  equipped for the race. We hope we get off to a good start, that the  weather plays ball, and that we get through the race without any  problems. Then we will really have a chance to challenge for the win.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am happy with the qualifying  sessions. We made a small step from Q1 to Q2. It was my first time  usng really soft tyres and I found a good feeling but we did not have  so many laps so I was careful with the tyres. It was enough to be  among the top and I took P2 in my group. The feeling on the bike is  good, also with the race tyres, so it looks like we are ready for the  race. So let’s have fun and try to fight for the top in the final race  of the season.” Kenny Foray: “Already now, I feel very good on the  bike. For sure, I missed some laps to be really confident. In Q2, my  pace was not so bad with the race tyre and I am happy for that. It was  not possible to improve with the qualifying tyre because there was too  much traffic and the feeling was not quite there but I think P2 is  good and I am confident for the race because the bike is working  really well and the pace is good.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINI Spain champions Manu San Félix and his ocean video series through the MINI VOICES platform;Through a three-part video series, marine biologist, photographer and explorer, Manu San Félix, shares his key discoveries and explains how we can love and protect the oceans.;"Munich. MINI Spain is endorsing Manu San Félix and  his triple marine project ""An Unexpected Journey"" via the  MINI Voices platform.Through a three-part video series encompassing his main projects -  ""Posidonia Finder Free App"", ""Pristine Seas"" and  ""Diving School"" - the marine biologist, reporter and  explorer shares his discoveries with others and provides information  on how to protect and love the oceans. ""People protect what they  love, but they only love what they know,"" says the diver who has  been researching and diving the seas around the world for more than 30  years. All three videos are now available to view on: https://www.mini.com/en_MS/home/minivoices/manu-san-felix.htmlWith MINI Voices, a platform has been created for people and  initiatives that have the potential to change the world. In several  European countries, MINI supports true drivers of change and start-ups  tackling today's social challenges with their unusual ideas  demonstrating how a sustainable and socially responsible future can be shaped.“We fully support and endorse San Félix’s innovative commitment to  sustainability and have been accompanying the explorer through some of  his most unexpected journeys and discoveries. We are delighted to be  able to support sustainable initiatives beyond the automotive  industry”, says Carlos Martínez, Head of MINI Spain. “An Unexpected Journey” – An overviewChapter 1, “In Search of the Mediterranean Blue”,  focuses on the well-known Posidonia marine plant, endemic to the  Mediterranean, and the greatest discovery of the marine biologist's  career. Thanks to the Posidonia Maps App, which San Félix developed  together with a team of technicians, a solution has been provided to  help preserve these species whose role is key in the Mediterranean ecosystem.Chapter 2, ""Teaching to Save the Planet"",  highlights the dedication with which Manu San Félix has been promoting  knowledge and love for the ocean from his diving school in Formentera,  exploring what led him to open it and the challenges he faces every  day to ensure the future of the world's oceans.Chapter 3, ""The last ice"", narrates how  Manu San Félix’s intervention has helped protect pristine seas, that  is, those that remain virgin to the action of human beings, such as  marine reserves. Through his work within the National Geographic  project “Pristine Seas”, however, the imminent thawing of the Arctic  threatens to open new marine routes which, without prevention, will  cross into these areas. Manu San Félix: A life dedicated to    preserving the oceansIn addition to being a renowned marine biologist whose project with  Posidonia meadows has led him to make reports for UNESCO, San Félix is  a photographic reporter awarded in 2004 (London) with the Wildlife  Photographer of the Year and in 2005 (Antibes, France ) with the World  Underwater Festival.Since 2009 he has been working for National Geographic as Underwater  Image Director for the Pristine    Seas project, participating in 35 expeditions around the world. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsSarah Bauer, Press Spokesperson Product Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-94180E-mail: sarah.bauer@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

In particular, the fully-electric BMW iX3*,  which has also been available in Europe since the start of the year,  gave sales a major boost, with a total of 20,887 units sold in the  year to date. “With the launch of the BMW iX and BMW i4 from November, we will have  two new vehicles in the market that will further accelerate the  ramp-up of electromobility. New orders worldwide already reflect our  customers’ enthusiasm for these new models,” explained PieterNota. Over the coming years, the BMW Group will be expanding its e-mobility  offering to include fully-electric versions of the BMW 7 Series, BMW  X1 and the high-volume BMW 5 Series, as well as the successor to the  MINI Countryman and the solely fully-electric Rolls-Royce Spectre,  which was recently announced for the fourth quarter of 2023. By 2023,  the BMW Group will have at least one fully-electric model on the roads  in about 90 percent of its current market segments. Between now and  2025, the company plans to increase its sales of fully-electric models  by an average of well over 50 percent per year – and will reach more  than ten times the number of units sold in 2020. The BMW Group expects  fully-electric vehicles to account for at least 50 percent of its  global sales in 2030. Over the next ten years or so, the company plans  to release a total of about ten million fully-electric vehicles onto  the roads. Availability of semiconductor components remains problematicIn the first nine months of the year, the BMW Group made individual  adjustments to its production programme in response to the limited  availability of semiconductor components. The company expects the  supply situation for semiconductor components to remain difficult.  Although the BMW Group has so far been able to absorb the impact of  these bottlenecks, the possibility of sales being affected in the  coming months cannot be ruled out. BMW brand posts significant growth in year to dateIn the year to the end of September, 19.3 percent more  BMW vehicles (1,703,080 units) were delivered  worldwide. With 764,958 units sold (+20.6%), sales of the brand’s  Sports Activity Vehicles and Sports Activity Coupés were particularly  strong across all segment. New models like the extensively revamped  BMW X3 and BMW X4 have joined the product line-up since the summer.  The new BMW 2 Series Coupé and new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé will soon  follow, both of which uniquely embody the brand's signature driving  pleasure and are primed to ensure the success of the BMW brand. MINI brand sees 81.9 percent sales growth in electrified vehiclesA total of 224,838 MINI vehicles (+7.9%) have been  delivered to customers worldwide since the start of the year. The  fully-electric MINI SE* was in particularly high demand and its sales  have increased 106.6 percent since January, with 20,104 units sold.  Overall, 15.2 percent of MINI vehicles released onto the roads in the  year to the end of September had an electrified drive train. This  strengthens the decision by the brand that stands for urban mobility  and sustainability to offer an exclusively all-electric product range  by 2030. The all-electric MINI Cooper SE* is also enjoying growing  popularity in the fleet business. In the third quarter, for example,  two major fleet customers expanded their fleet by 82 and 140 MINI  Electric vehicles respectively, giving their employees the opportunity  to experience local zero-emission driving fun. BMW M GmbH posts significant sales growth in YTD SeptemberWith 123,008 units sold in the year to the end of September (+22.2%),    BMW M GmbH increased its sales significantly  year-on-year. The success of the M3 and M4 high-performance models  introduced in March continued. The X5 M and X6 M once again made a  major contribution to this sales success. In the Performance Segment,  the M440 Coupé and Convertible were the main growth drivers, alongside  the successful M340 derivatives. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars: YTD sales already surpassed total    figure for 2020Rolls-Royce Motor Cars reported sales of 4,318  (+62.9%) motor cars in the first nine months of the year, surpassing  the total figure for 2020. Global demand remains strong across all  models in all regions of the world. In particular, new Ghost and  Cullinan contributed substantially to the sales success of the brand.  The company recently announced its first fully electric car, the  Rolls-Royce Spectre, which will come to market in Q4 2023;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Group invests in innovative method for efficient and sustainable lithium extraction;New process from Lilac Solutions focuses on sustainable extraction, efficiency and costs;Munich. The BMW Group is stepping up its expansion of  electromobility and will be releasing about ten million fully-electric  vehicles onto the roads over the next ten years or so. By 2030, at  least half the BMW Group’s global sales are expected to come from  fully-electric vehicles. This will also increase the need for lithium,  an important raw material for production of battery cells.To promote environmentally-friendly, resource-efficient extraction of  lithium, the BMW Group is investing, through its venture capital fund,  BMW i Ventures, in an innovative process developed by US startup Lilac  Solutions. Lilac Solutions has developed and patented an ion exchange  technology that will significantly improve efficiency, costs and  sustainability by extracting lithium from brine resources, which are  natural deposits of salt water.“Innovative technologies provide better, more sustainable and more  efficient access to raw materials. By investing in startups, we are  speeding up development of new technologies, stimulating competition  and providing impetus that will make it easier for young companies to  access the market,” said Wolfgang Obermaier, Senior Vice President  Indirect Goods and Services, Raw Materials, Production Partners at the  BMW Group. “By investing in Lilac Solutions, we are supporting  technological progress in the field of lithium extraction, with a  focus on responsible and sustainable methods.”Lilac Solutions has developed a new ion exchange technology to make  mining lithium from brine resources more efficient and cost-effective.  The company seeks to significantly reduce environmental impact  compared to conventional methods, while, at the same time, protecting  local communities and ecosystems. The technology has already been  proven in initial field pilots and must now demonstrate that it can be  scaled and industrialised in the mid-term. The process could then be  used with brines worldwide, even if they have a low lithium content. BMW Group provides battery cell manufacturers with responsibly    extracted lithiumThe BMW Group has made sustainability and resource efficiency central  to the company’s strategic direction. A key aspect here is compliance  with environmental and social standards in the supply chain.  Eliminating infringements of human rights and environmental standards  presents a particular challenge in the case of critical raw materials  – as is the case with lithium. For this raw material, BMW Group  Purchasing has implemented therefore additional measures and is  sourcing lithium directly from the mines and making it available to  battery cell suppliers. In this way, the company creates complete  transparency about the origin and mining methods of the material.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The all-new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer.;Spatial functionality, hallmark BMW driving pleasure and an extremely progressive approach mark out the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer. The second generation of the sporty all-rounder for the premium compact segment exudes visual dynamism and imposing presence through BMW’s clear design language. Its fundamentally redesigned interior combines a variety of usage possibilities with modern geometry and a BMW Curved Display in the style of the BMW iX. Added to which, the new 2 Series Active Tourer leads the way when it comes to powertrain, driver assistance, control/operation and connectivity innovations.; Its uncomplicated functionality, progressive character profile and  range of standard equipment – which comfortably exceeds that of the  predecessor model and stands out against its rivals – make the new  BMW 2 Series Active Tourer a particularly attractive proposition for  active, lifestyle-oriented target groups. Four model variants with  front-wheel drive and outputs ranging from 100 kW/136 hp to  160 kW/218 hp will be available at launch in February 2022. The new  model will be built at BMW Group Plant Leipzig and its vehicle  architecture is designed to accommodate both combustion engines and  electrified drive systems. Two plug-in hybrid models will be added to  the line-up a few months after launch.Design: modern crossover character, striking front end,    dynamically stretched proportions.The exterior design of the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer brings  lifestyle attributes and aesthetic sophistication together into a  modern crossover character profile. The clean, reduced surface  treatment exudes sporting prowess and assured presence. At the front  end of the car, these qualities are expressed most prominently by the  striking BMW kidney grille, with its increased dimensions, and the  slim contours of the headlights. The new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer  comes as standard with full-LED headlights. Adaptive LED Headlights  with cornering light function, non-dazzling matrix high beam, urban  lights, a motorway beam pattern and bad weather light are on the  options list.Much more heavily raked A-pillars compared to the predecessor model,  a stretched side window graphic, flush-fitting door handles and slim  C-pillars also play their part in the new car’s dynamic silhouette.  The newly designed door shoulders around the A-pillars create much  improved all-round visibility. With its broad shoulders and slim LED  light units, the rear of the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer cuts a  particularly muscular figure. The exhaust tailpipes are integrated  into the rear apron out of sight on all model variants.Depending on the model variant, 16-inch or 17-inch light-alloy wheels  are fitted as standard. Light-alloy wheels up to 19 inches in size are  available as an option. The new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer can also be  ordered in Luxury Line trim or with an M Sport package as alternatives  to basic specification. Two non-metallic and nine metallic paint  finishes are available for the exterior.Progressive premium ambience and wide-ranging interior functionality.The size and versatility of the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer’s  interior are emphasised by the fundamental redesign introduced by the  second-generation car. The cabin geometry and a host of details take  their cues from the interior concept of the BMW iX technology  flagship. This creates a progressive premium ambience, the key  features of which include the slim instrument panel, the BMW Curved  Display, the “floating” armrest with integrated control panel and an  across-the-board reduction in the number of physical control elements.The space underneath the armrest is used as a storage compartment,  while the area in front of it houses generously sized cup holders and  a newly designed smartphone slot. The phone remains visible to the  driver and front passenger here and can be wirelessly charged as an option.The new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer offers occupants in its five seats  noticeably better long-distance comfort that of its predecessor. The  newly developed, multi-adjustable seats can also be ordered in  optional Sensatec perforated or Vernasca leather. Also on the options  list are sport seats with prominent bolsters and shoulder areas,  electric seat adjustment (including memory function), lumbar support  and a massage function. Acoustic comfort and occupant protection have  been stepped up too. Indeed, a new interaction airbag between the  driver and front passenger is added to the integrated passive safety concept.An array of storage areas and the multi-adjustable rear seats also  contribute to the car’s uncomplicated functionality in everyday use  and on longer tips away. With the rear backrests in their cargo  position, boot capacity increases by as much as 90 litres. The rear  seats can also slide forwards by up to 13 centimetres. This and the  40 : 20 : 40 split/folding rear seat backrests present customers with  a load compartment that can be used for a multitude of purposes. Boot  capacity is 470 –1,455 litres in the BMW 218i Active Tourer and  BMW 218d Active Tourer and 415 – 1,405 litres in the  BMW 220i Active Tourer and BMW 223i Active Tourer. Automatic tailgate  operation comes as standard, while an electrically operated trailer  tow hitch can be ordered as an option.Two-zone automatic climate control, sports steering wheel and    BMW Maps as standard.The progressive premium character of the new BMW 2 Series Active  Tourer is also underscored by its extensive standard specification.  Fitted as standard alongside the BMW Maps navigation system are four  USB-C ports and a 12V power socket in both the centre console and the  boot, intelligent two-zone automatic climate control, a Sport leather  steering wheel, a rain sensor with windscreen wiper control and  automatic headlight activation, a much larger number of driver  assistance systems compared with the predecessor model, and Park  Assist with Reversing Assist Camera.Newly structured equipment packages enable extremely specific  individualisation of the car. Customers can order high-quality  interior trim strips, as well as Sensatec surfaces for the instrument  panel and front door shoulders with eye-catching contrast stitching.  Other contributors to the premium feel include a mirror package,  ambient lighting, a panoramic glass sunroof and a Harman Kardon Sound System.BMW 2 Series Active Tourer: setting the pace in innovative    powertrain technology.The new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is also at the vanguard of  powertrain technology. The extensively updated combustion engines  increase driving pleasure while reducing fuel consumption and  emissions, and the latest generation of the seven-speed Steptronic  dual-clutch transmission – now standard for all model variants – is  likewise extremely efficient. A new version of 48V mild hybrid  technology is making its debut in the BMW 223i Active Tourer (fuel  consumption: 6.6 – 6.0 litres/100 km [42.8 – 47.1 mpg imp];  CO2 emissions combined: 154 – 140 g/km in the WLTP test cycle).All the petrol engines feature a new combustion process and a dual  injection system. The diesel engine powering the new  BMW 218d Active Tourer (fuel consumption: 5.3 – 4.8 litres/100 km  [53.3 – 58.9 mpg imp];" CO2 emissions combined:  138 – 125 g/km in the WLTP test cycle) employs low-friction pistons  and two-stage turbocharging with increased efficiency. Maximum output  is 110 kW/150 hp.The line-up will expand further in summer 2022 with the addition of  two plug-in hybrid models. These will feature fifth-generation BMW  eDrive technology for the first time, enhancing dynamism and giving  them a significantly longer electric range.Sportiness and long-distance comfort in perfect harmony.The chassis technology in the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer has  been engineered to deliver the brand’s customary sporting flair  combined with impressive levels of ride comfort in every situation.  With a body construction that reduces weight while increasing  rigidity, a long wheelbase, and wider tracks than its predecessor, the  car’s basic design provides the ideal blueprint for the job at hand.Steering precision and agility have been enhanced by targeted updates  for the single-joint spring strut axle at the front and the three-link  rear axle. The near-actuator wheel slip limitation function included  as standard improves both traction and directional stability. The  integrated braking system is another new feature, as is the extra,  lift-related damping for the front axle. The optional adaptive M  suspension includes frequency-selective damping, sport steering and a  15-millimetre drop in ride height.A fresh variety of systems for automated driving and parking.The largest selection of systems for automated driving and  parking yet offered for a BMW compact-segment model are available for  the new edition of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer. Standard  specification includes Cruise Control with brake function, Lane  Departure Warning, the Evasion Assistant and front-collision warning.  The latter now also reacts to oncoming traffic when turning left and  to pedestrians and cyclists and when turning right (in countries where  vehicles drive on the right). The Parking Assistant including  Reversing Assist Camera and Reversing Assistant also comes as  standard. Options include the Steering and Lane Control Assistant,  Active Cruise Control with Stop&Go function, Active Navigation,  the exit warning function, the BMW Head-Up Display and the Surround  View, Remote 3D View, BMW Drive Recorder and Remote Theft Recorder functions.Existing functions can be improved or expanded by means of Remote  Software Upgrades, and customers can also use Functions on Demand to  select and import a range of functions at a later stage, such as  Driving Assistant Plus including Active Cruise Control with  Stop&Go function (availability depends on the hardware fitted in  the vehicle and the market conditions).The new BMW iDrive makes its debut in the premium compact segment.The new generation of the control/operation system iDrive,  included here in a compact-segment model from BMW for the first time,  is based on BMW Operating System 8. It links up as standard with the  BMW Curved Display – with its state-of-the-art graphics and menu  structure – and the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant with expanded  skills range. The BMW Curved Display fully digital screen grouping is  formed by a 10.25-inch information display and a control display with  a screen diagonal of 10.7 inches. The new BMW iDrive is built around  intuitive touch control and voice control.The new My Modes bring together individually selected vehicle  settings with the relevant interior experience worlds. The cloud-based  navigation system BMW Maps can be specified as an option with the  Augmented View function on the control display. The interior camera  allows those on board to take snapshots during a journey and send them  to their smartphone. New BMW 2 Series Active Tourer customers can also  make use of a Personal eSIM designed to work with the new 5G mobile  technology, as well as the BMW ID for individualisation of the user  experience and further improved smartphone integration with Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Madeline Hollander unveils “Sunrise/Sunset” as part of BMW Open Work. Site-specific installation to premiere at Frieze London 2021.;For the fifth consecutive year, BMW and Frieze continue their long-term partner-ship with the major art initiative BMW Open Work by Frieze. The artist selected by curator Attilia Fattori Franchini to create the latest edition of BMW Open Work by Frieze is the Los An-geles-based Madeline Hollander will present a live, site-specific installation in the BMW Lounge at Frieze London in 2021. ;Munich/London. For the fifth consecutive year, BMW  and Frieze continue their long-term partnership with the major art  initiative BMW Open Work by Frieze. Drawing  inspiration from BMW engineering the project brings together art,  technology and design in pioneering multi-platform formats. The artist  selected by curator Attilia Fattori Franchini to create the latest  edition of BMW Open Work by Frieze is the Los Angeles-based    Madeline Hollander, who introduced the commission  through an interactive digital platform and livery intervention on BMW  i3 electric vehicles during Frieze Week 2020, and will present a live,  site-specific installation in the BMW Lounge at Frieze London in 2021.  As in previous years, BMW will also provide the VIP shuttle service  transporting the fair’s VIP guests with the new all electric BMW iX.Working with performance, film and installation, Hollander explores  how the human body in motion negotiates its limits within everyday  systems of technology and engineering, industrial apparatus,  intellectual property and daily rituals. Her performances and  installations present perpetually looping events that intervene within  spatial, psychological and temporal landscapes, and engage with novel  modes of viewership. Titled “Sunrise/Sunset” the  project continues the artist's recent research into traffic patterns  and working without human actors to depict unseen systems or  processes. Emerging from an inspiring dialogue with the department  responsible for sustainability at BMW Group and investigation into the  automatic adaptive system of BMW headlights, Hollander created for  Frieze London 2021, a site-specific, and self-sufficient, live  installation composed of one hundred  recycled BMW LED headlights from  the BMW Group Recycling and Dismantling Centre. Thus, the artist  developed an energetic loop, a networked map choreographed by the  sunsets and sunrises across the globe. Fascinated by the responsive  nature of headlights technology which reacts to a number of factors  such as movement, light and weather conditions, the artist synced each  headlight to different time zones creating a live and ceaseless global  clock. In Hollander’s work our apparently erratic individual actions  and everyday technologies synchronically align, becoming a collective,  and in this case cascading-dance. The installation is accompanied by  an original score created for the occasion by the composer    Celia Hollander.In addition to Madeline Hollander’s commission for BMW Open Work by  Frieze, Superblue and BMW i will present the world premiere of    “No One is an Island”, a collaboration between  Random International and Studio Wayne McGregor. “No One is an Island”  is fuelled by science and explores electrified movement steered by  advanced algorithms. It is a future-oriented reflection on how the  human mind empathises with artificial intelligence and automated  processes. The performance comprises sculptural, performative, and  musical aspects.The centrepiece is a sculpture by Random  International that experiments with the minimal amount of  information that is actually necessary for an animated form to be  recognised as human;" in 2019, Camille Blatrix collaborated  with BMW Individual to explore the primal and emotional relationships  to labor and materiality, raising questions about functionality and  desire in the installation “Sirens”. For further questions please contact:Prof. Dr  Thomas Girst BMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Head of Cultural EngagementTelephone: +49 89 382  24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comDoris FleischerBMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Cultural EngagementTelephone: +49 89 328 27806Email:    Doris.Fleischer@bmw.dewww.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.de""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team in the FIM EWC: six-hour race at Most for 2021 finale.;A premiere for the 2021 finale: the Autodrom Most in the Czech Republic is hosting the FIM Endurance World Championship (EWC) for the first time this season. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team will be racing there this coming weekend (7th to 9th October) in the fourth and final event of the season, the 6 Hours of Most. Once again, Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Kenny Foray (FRA) will be in the saddle on the #37 BMW M 1000 RR.;Munich. A premiere for the 2021 finale: the Autodrom Most in    the Czech Republic is hosting the FIM Endurance World Championship    (EWC) for the first time this season. The BMW Motorrad World    Endurance Team will be racing there this coming weekend (7th to 9th    October) in the fourth and final event of the season, the 6 Hours of    Most. Once again, Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR)    and Kenny Foray (FRA) will be in the saddle on the #37 BMW M 1000    RR. Xavi Forés (ESP) can’t particitpate at Most due to the shoulder    injury he suffered during free practice for the Bol d’Or at Le    Castellet (FRA). The famous 8 Hours of Suzuka in Japan had originally been scheduled  as the season finale, however the Coronavirus situation rendered that  impossible, prompting the FIM EWC to move the season finale to Most.  It will be appearing there at the weekend, together with the World  Touring Car Cup (FIA WTCR). Although Most is a new addition to the FIM  EWC calendar, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is familiar with  the circuit in the north-west of the Czech Republic from the  International German Motorcycle Championship (IDM), in which  Mikhalchik recently claimed his third championship title. The BMW  Motorrad World Endurance Team has been testing with the #37 M RR at  Most ahead of the finale. BMW Motorrad Motorsport also competed there  at the start of August in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). The two qualifying sessions will take place on Thursday 7th October.  The race starts on Saturday 9th October at 11:00 CEST. The race was  originally scheduled to last eight hours, however it was reduced to  six hours due to noise control regulations, and to ensure that the  riders would have sufficient daylight. As at every FIM EWC finale, the  number of points on offer is increased by 150 %, meaning that the  winner scores 45 points and pole position is worth five points. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team secured the third spot on the  podium in the first two races of the season at Le Mans (FRA) and  Estoril (POR). At race three at Le Castellet, the team was again  involved in the battle for the podium but was forced to retire early  due to a technical problem. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is  heading to the finale in fifth position in the championship standings,  21 points behind second place. Quotes ahead of the season finale at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  finale will once again be really exciting with the intense six-hour  race at Most. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team has done some  outstanding work this season and has been one of the teams battling  for the world championship title. Retiring due to technical problems  at Le Castellet was certainly a setback, but that can always happen in  endurance racing – what we saw on more than one occasion at Le  Castellet. However, we still have the chance to reach the rostrum in  the overall world championship standings. A world championship podium  would be just reward for the entire team and for the riders, after all  their efforts in this project and I know that they will give their all  to round off the season with this success.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “Our objective at Most is pretty simple, we are going to try  to win there. We had some really good testing there and I hope that we  can turn those test results into race results. Our riders are  extremely motivated, the motorbike is perfect. We have all the  ingredients to reach the podium and also to aim for the win. We are  sorry that Xavi has to miss this race, and we all wish him a speedy recovery.” Markus Reiterberger: “Our testing at Most was good  and we are well set for the final six-hour sprint. I haven't been back  to Most for a long time and I will have to get to the know the circuit  again. I like it a lot and I am looking forward to the finale. It will  be a real sprint race. We did well during testing, the team has  prepared the bike well and I also think that the circuit suits our  Dunlop tyres. I hope that the weather is on our side, that we will  have another great race weekend and round off the season in a  successful way. The team has earned a reward for all the hard work and  I hope that we can manage it.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I know the Most track well and the  BMW M 1000 RR works well on that circuit. So our whole package is good  and we are ready. Six hours is like a sprint race and I think that we  will have a good fight with the other factory teams. We again want to  show our potential, enjoy the race and try to fight for the top again  at the final race of the season.” Kenny Foray: “First of all, I am very sorry for Xavi  and whish him a speedy recovery. So I stand in in the last moment, but  I am happy to discover a new track and I hope that I can help the team  to get a good result in the race and to finish the season on a high.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW M Motorsport News, 4th October 2021.;Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you a regular overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. ;"DTM: Difficult weekend at the Hockenheimring. The BMW M Motorsport teams from Walkenhorst Motorsport and ROWE  Racing were unable to record the top results they had hoped for at the  penultimate race weekend of the DTM season at the Hockenheimring  (GER). Marco Wittmann (GER), who began the weekend in second place in  the drivers’ standings, was forced to retire from Saturday’s race in  his BMW M6 GT3. He was unable to improve on eleventh place on Sunday  and finished empty-handed. Wittmann is in fourth position ahead of the  finale, his home race at the Norisring (GER). Timo Glock (GER) reached  the points for ROWE Racing on Sunday, finishing in tenth place. He  claimed 14th position on Sunday. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) endured  some really bad luck and had to retire his BMW M6 GT3 from both races. “It was a very frustrating and disappointing weekend for us,” said  Wittmann. “Ultimately, we as the entire BMW team simply didn’t produce  a performance over the weekend. We need to find out what caused it."" --DTM Trophy: BMW M4 GT4 wins both races at Hockenheim.Theo Oeverhaus (GER) and Ben Green (GBR) were the two big winners of  the penultimate race weekend in the DTM Trophy season at the  Hockenheimring (GER). Just 16 years old, Oeverhaus celebrated his  first win in the top-level race series on Saturday in the BMW M4 GT4  from Walkenhorst Motorsport. He followed that up with another podium  on Sunday, finishing third as the rain set in. FK Performance  Motorsport driver Green celebrated victory in the second race as he  moved back to the top of the overall standings. He had already crossed  the finish line first in race one, however he received a 30-second  time penalty for leaving too large a gap ahead during a safety car  period, which dropped him back to ninth place. Third place in  Saturday’s race went to Green’s team-mate Moritz Löhner (GER). Ahead  of the final weekend in the DTM Trophy at the Norisring (GER), Green  has a three-point lead over William Tregurtha (GBR, Mercedes) in the  battle for the title. --ADAC GT Masters: Points finish for Schubert Motorsport.On the fifth out of seven race weekends in the ADAC GT Masters at the  Sachsenring (GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) finished  in the points in Saturday’s race in the BMW M6 GT3 from Schubert  Motorsport. The duo battled up from 14th on the grid to finish tenth.  They gave another chasing performance on Sunday, progressing from  twelfth on the grid to seventh place, but were disqualified after the  race for technical reasons. --ADAC GT4 Germany: Win and overall lead for Schrey and Piana.Michael Schrey (GER) and Gabriele Piana (ITA) remain on course for  the title after the fifth of seven race weekends in the ADAC GT4  Germany at the Sachsenring (GER). The duo won Sunday’s race in the BMW  M4 GT4 from Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport, having secured fifth  place on Saturday. In the overall standings, Schrey and Piana each  have 170 points and are 35 points ahead of their nearest rivals. There  was another podium finish to celebrate for the BMW M4 GT4 on Sunday.  Marcel Lenerz and Christopher Dreyspring (both GER) from the Schubert  Motorsport team finished in third place. --GT World Challenge America: Turner Motorsport shows team    spirit at Sebring.From a sporting perspective, the race weekend in the SRO GT World  Challenge America at Sebring (USA) was a disappointment for Turner  Motorsport. However, the way the racing played out allowed them to  give a perfect display of team spirit. After a crash in qualifying,  the BMW M6 GT3 was so severely damaged that not all the parts required  to repair it were available at the racetrack. Despite that, the crew  still managed to acquire the replacement parts within the limited  amount of time, to rebuild the car, and to at least take part in race  two on Sunday. Unfortunately, that huge effort was not rewarded with a  good race result. GT4/GT/TC America: Successful weekend for BMW M Motorsport teams.BMW M Motorsport teams celebrated many successes with the BMW M4 GT4,  BMW M2 CS Racing and the BMW M240i Racing at the race weekend at  Sebring (USA). In GT America, Sean Quinlan (USA) won the GT4 class in  the Saturday race at the wheel of a Stephen Cameron Racing BMW M4 GT4.  In the second race, he was hampered by a spin after a collision. In GT4 America, Quinlan and Gregory Liefooghe (USA) finished third to  claim a spot on the podium in the Pro-Am class on Saturday, as did  Bill Auberlen and James Walker (both USA) on Sunday. In the Silver  class, third place went to Stevan McAleer (GBR) and Toby Grahovec  (USA) in race one, and Tim Barber and Cole Ciraulo (both USA) in race  two. In the Am class, Paul Sparta and Al Carter (both USA) won  Saturday’s race, before finishing runner-up on Sunday. In the TCX class of TC America, the winner of both races was Stephen  Cugliari (USA).

This time, the car  was driven by Michael Schrey (GER), Michael Fischer and Markus Fischer  (both AUT). Jake Dennis (GBR) was competing again in this class. The  third-placed driver in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship 2021  once again raced alongside Niklas Krütten (GER) in the #652 BMW M240i  Racing from the Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive. The duo  secured pole position and posted the fastest lap time in the class,  but then retired due to a technical defect. The ninth and final NLS race of the 2021 season will take place next  Sunday, 9th October. Ahead of the finale, Brink and Leisen top the  overall standings in the NLS with 66.59 points and a lead of 0.55 points. --TC France: Victory and title win for the BMW M2 CS Racing.At the final round of the TC France season at Le Castellet (FRA),  Steven Palette (FRA) from the VSF Sports - Amplitude Automobile team  won the Driver title.

Milestone at Portimão: Michael van der Mark records first win for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team on the BMW M 1000 RR.;The chequered flag for the Superpole race on Sunday morning at Portimão (POR) was greeted with boundless celebrations in the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team pit area. Michael van der Mark (NED) won the race on his BMW M 1000 RR and the team celebrated the first win for BMW Motorrad Motorsport since returning to the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). The result marks the next important milestone for the project.;Portimão. The chequered flag for the Superpole race on Sunday    morning at Portimão (POR) was greeted with boundless celebrations in    the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team pit area. Michael van der Mark (NED)    won the race on his BMW M 1000 RR and the team celebrated the first    win for BMW Motorrad Motorsport since returning to the FIM Superbike    World Championship (WorldSBK). The result marks the next important    milestone for the project. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad,    was at Portimão for the race weekend and was the first to offer his congratulations. Van der Mark was already on fast form during the rainy warm-up  session, posting the best time on Sunday morning. The rain had stopped  in time for the Superpole race but the circuit had not dried out.  Starting from fifth on the grid, van der Mark had already moved up to  third by the end of lap one. He then passed Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR /  Yamaha) and moved into second place on lap two. On the next lap, he  left Scott Redding (GBR / Ducati) behind to take the lead. Van der  Mark never looked likely to surrender his lead, claiming the  long-awaited first win after ten laps – fully 5.330 seconds ahead of  his rivals. Having won the Superpole race, van der Mark started the afternoon’s  second race from pole position. That race took place in sunny  conditions on a dry surface. However, a technical issue prevented him  from mounting a real attack and he completed the second race in sixth place. Eugene Laverty (IRL), racing in place of Tom Sykes (GBR) again at  Portimão, moved up from 13th on the grid to ninth position in the  Superpole race. In the afternoon’s second race, he crossed the line in  tenth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team  completed the Superpole race in 13th place, and then crossed the line  in 15th position in the afternoon’s second race. As the team will not  be competing in the two upcoming overseas events, these were Folger’s  last WorldSBK races of the season. The Italian privateer team B-Max Racing Team raced at Portimão with a  wildcard for rider Gabriele Ruiu (ITA). Ruiu finished 15th in the  Superpole race. He retired early from both main races over the weekend. The eleventh round of the season at Portimão marks the end of the  European season in the WorldSBK 2021. The racing continues in two  weeks with the penultimate event of the season in Argentina, while the  finale will take place in Indonesia in November. Quotes after race two at Portimão. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: “It is  something special to secure the first win for a project like this. I  also think that we as a team have deserved this, and it shows that we  are heading in the right direction. We are all proud of this win,  which is an important step for the project that we are aiming to  develop gradually. Congratulations to Michael van der Mark, the entire  BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and everyone involved in this success. I  would like to thank them all for their efforts and their hard work.” Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “This  win is a real milestone for our project. It is just brilliant and I  would like to thank the entire team. Thanks to BMW Motorrad as well  for supporting this project. The conditions were pretty special this  morning with the wet surface. Mickey showed during the warm-up that he  is extremely fast and then produced a superb performance in the  Superpole race. We know that the motorbike also goes really well in  the wet. None of us will forget him crossing the line in a hurry. The  pole position then gave us the best starting position you can have for  the second race. Unfortunately, Mickey was struggling with an issue  but that cannot spoil our delight at his victory. Eugene was not so  happy with the motorbike in the wet this morning, but we were still  able to make progress for the Superpole race and he recorded another  two top-ten finishes. Overall, it was a really positive weekend for us.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “I am really, really happy for everyone in the project. We  have worked very, very hard to get into this position. We are  ambitious and we have proved that by the steps we have made over the  years. It is still very early in the project considering we lost  almost a year due to Covid. I am pleased for Mickey as well. To put  him back on the podium and then to win that race just gives him the  confidence and knowing we are going in the right direction. This  weekend we knew all along, from qualifying on. We had a good pace in  the wet and in the dry and I think that was the reward for him and the  whole team so I am really pleased for everybody. In race two, Mickey  made an okay start. We lost a few places but he was in the right group  but we had a technical issue in the middle of the race. At that point  he was second quickest on track and I think the podium for sure was in  sight, but with the circumstances, the wind conditions and everything,  we take that sixth position. For Eugene to stand in on the second  weekend in a row he did a fantastic job. To finish in the top-ten  against guys who have been racing in the championship for the full  season just shows the quality there so he has done exactly what we  expected from him. Overall, it has been a successful weekend. Now we  are heading overseas and we hope we can get Tom fit and ready for  Argentina and get the team back to full strength.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Yeah, it was a pretty good day. Of course, this morning it  was nice to get a win with the BMW M1000 RR. It was a good race and I  already felt good in the rain from this morning, and this carried  through into the race, even when it started to dry, I still had a good  feeling on the bike. I’m happy to take the win for BMW Motorrad and  the whole team. Race 2 I didn’t get a good start, but I felt I had  good pace but unfortunately we had some issues which cost me a lot of  time and then my race from there was a bit lonely as I couldn’t catch  up the guys in front. We have to learn, but at the end it was not a  bad Sunday.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was  an OK day, but I am not satisfied with the race results as I wanted to  be further up the field. We have tried to make the bike mine and we  did make some progress in the dry race this afternoon, but I still  couldn’t get the bike to load the front and have agility, so it was  tough to finish like that. The wet race was nice. I did struggle in  the first three laps to get heat into the rear tyre but once I got  some temperature in the tyre it was enjoyable, and we got a good  result from it.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It’s a case of  mixed emotions for me. On the one hand, I am sad to be leaving the  team. On the other hand, I am also a little bit relieved that a  difficult year is now over. The final race was not an easy one either,  as I had problems in the apex and when exiting corners. I couldn’t do  any proper slides out of the turn, as my slides were really  aggressive, so I just got it to the finish line. I would like to thank  the whole team. We moved up to the WorldSBK together this year. They  are all great people and we had a lot of fun together. I will  certainly remember the great moments and they will all have a place in  my heart.”  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WorldSBK Saturday at Portimão: Michael van der Mark retires from battle for podium through no fault of his own after strong performance.;A strong performance saw Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team aim for the podium in Saturday’s race at Portimão (POR). However, he was forced to retire six laps from the end, having fallen after another rider hit his rear wheel. Eugene Laverty (IRL), standing in for Tom Sykes (GBR) again at Portimão, finished the first race in ninth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team crossed the line in 15th position.;Portimão. A strong performance saw Michael van der Mark (NED)    from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team aim for the podium in Saturday’s    race at Portimão (POR). However, he was forced to retire six laps    from the end, having fallen after another rider hit his rear wheel.    Eugene Laverty (IRL), standing in for Tom Sykes (GBR) again at    Portimão, finished the first race in ninth place. Jonas Folger (GER)    from the Bonovo MGM Racing team was racing at Portimão for the first    time and crossed the line in 15th position. The Portuguese racetrack    is hosting the eleventh round of the FIM Superbike World    Championship 2021 (WorldSBK). In Superpole on Saturday morning, van der Mark claimed fifth place in  the second row of the grid, on his BMW M 1000 RR. Laverty was also  going well but fell after sliding during the closing stage of the  qualifying session. That prevented him from bettering the lap time  already posted and he finished in 13th place. Folger finished  Superpole in 19th position. Van der Mark initially fell back a few places at the start of the  first race. However, a great recovery performance saw him move back up  to swiftly become part of the chasing pack battling for the third spot  on the podium. However, his charge to the podium came to an end on lap  15 out of 20 when a rider touched his rear wheel on entry to turn  five, causing him to fall. Van der Mark got back up and re-joined but  was forced to head for the pits and retire. Laverty moved up into the  top ten at the start. As the race progressed, he fell back a little  but then found his rhythm, crossing the finish line in ninth place.  After 20 race laps, Folger secured 15th place to score one point. Quotes after race one at Portimão. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  made good progress in the third practice session this morning. Michael  gave an outstanding performance in qualifying. He often struggles with  the qualifying tyres and it was amazing to get him into fifth place.  Eugene had an unfortunate fall and had to be content with 13th place.  Mickey didn't get the start quite right and he was back in twelfth  place after the first few turns, but once again, he gave a very, very  good chasing performance. We were right in the battle for the podium.  Michael said that he would have made it and he had already moved into  an overtaking position. Unfortunately, Andrea Locatelli then touched  him from behind and caused the fall. That finished off the race for  him. It was a real shame as he was clearly in with a chance of  reaching the podium. So, we’ll start the Superpole race tomorrow from  P5 and then we’ll see what’s possible. Eugene rode a consistent race  and I am confident that he will be able to take another step forward  tomorrow at his home circuit.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Eugene did a good job today. He rode a good race and came  strong at the end which we know he can do. Superpole was difficult for  him and we didn’t get the Q tyre to work for him very well but in the  end, he did a good job so credit to Eugene for that performance. I am  still a bit lost for words on the Michael situation. Nevertheless, we  have to dust ourselves down and build Mickey up overnight and get him  ready for the Superpole race. We are clearly disappointed as we had  the podium in sight which is what I think we deserved this weekend.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning we changed a lot on the bike compared to  yesterday and I felt really good in FP3. In Superpole, I had a good  lap and I ended up starting in P5. That was a good step for us and I  was really happy with the starting position. During race one, I messed  up the start and got stuck in traffic at T1, so I lost a lot of  places. After that I had a good pace and was catching the group in  front of me. I managed to get past those guys and had some good  battles but unfortunately, I got taken out at T5 by Locatelli which  was a shame because we were fighting for the podium with Bautista and  Baz. But that is racing, and we try again tomorrow.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am  happy with that race result because we have been working progressively  forward all weekend. The guys did a fantastic job in making the bike  feel like my bike which made me feel like home. We qualified low but  had a fantastic first few corners and gained a lot of positions.  Unfortunately, we had a problem with the clutch at the start and had  issues in corner entry but once I got used to this problem, I settled  into a good rhythm and got a good result. Without this problem at the  beginning, I think we could have been higher up today.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Superpole and the  race were really difficult today. In Superpole, we were unable to make  use of the advantages the qualifying tyres normally bring.  Unfortunately, I made a bad start to the race from 19th on the grid. I  was playing catch-up for a long time and wasn’t able to build up a  good feel with the rear and front grip. I was struggling all through  the race. We did manage to score one point, as some riders ahead of us  took a tumble, but overall the race was rather disappointing.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Sustainably produced and highly individual: BMW M4 small series takes shape using new paint process; BMW Group Plant Dingolfing pilots new paint process  Overspray-free paint application opens up a wide range of possibilities for customisation  Unique combination of customer benefits and sustainability  Technology boosts both resource and energy efficiency ;  BMW Group Plant Dingolfing pilots new paint  process  Overspray-free paint application opens up a wide range of  possibilities for customisation  Unique combination of customer  benefits and sustainability  Technology boosts both resource and  energy efficiency  Munich / Dingolfing. BMW Group Plant Dingolfing is  piloting a new overspray-free painting process that allows several  paint colours to be used and designs to be applied without stencils or  masking the vehicle. The highly innovative application method not only  increases the degree of individualisation for customers, but also  contributes to sustainability by reducing waste and energy  consumption. The technology is being used for the first time in 19 BMW  M4 Coupés, which will soon roll off the production line at Plant  Dingolfing with custom two-tone paintwork and M4 identification on the  bonnet and tailgate. Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,  responsible for Production: “We expect the highest standards of  efficiency, sustainability and digitalisation from our production.  This smart painting technology meets all the requirements for an  innovative production process and also offers unique customer benefits.” The BMW Group developed the new EcoPaintJet Pro application process  for waterborne base coats and 2K clear coat in collaboration with  mechanical and plant engineering firm Dürr. In the conventional  procedure, paint is atomised by a rotating bell with 35 to 55,000  revolutions per minute and adheres electrostatically to the body. The  new method works without electrostatics, relying instead on jet  application. The paint is applied using an orifice plate that enables  high edge definition with a variable paint thickness of between 1 and  appr. 50 millimetres. This requires maximum precision from both the  robot and application technology. It also means two different colours  of paint can be used, e.g. for a contrasting roof, and stripes and  other designs applied – for instance, on the bonnet. The focus of  technology and material development was on achieving the maximum range  of applications. It will now be possible to paint every exterior  component – offering customers virtually limitless options for individualisation. Until now, custom designs like this can only be realised using manual  masking. With the new technology, the material and personnel costs  this previously entailed will be eliminated, making it possible to  realize these options at a lower cost. This innovative process also  prevents so-called overspray, i.e. excess paint particles, which  therefore no longer has to be disposed of. A further contribution to  sustainable production comes from lower energy consumption: Since  paint separation is no longer required, the amount of air needed is  also lower. At around 7,000 operating hours, this results in energy  savings of more than 6,000 megawatt hours and reduces the carbon  footprint by nearly 2,000 tonnes per year. Development of innovative  paint technology for further series applications will continue. With the paintwork for the M4 small series, the BMW Group is testing  the possibilities of the new process. These unique vehicles will  initially be used in the company's own fleet. Series introduction of  the piloted paint process is scheduled to begin in 2022 in the BMW  Group production network.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ad-hoc announcement: BMW AG raises earnings guidance for the financial year 2021;Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG) increases the guidance corridor for the EBIT margin of the Automotive Segment from between 7% and 9% to between 9.5% and 10.5% for the financial year 2021. Additionally, the guidance corridor for the Return on Equity for the Financial Services Segment is revised from between 17% and 20% to between 20% and 23%.;Munich. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft  (BMW AG) increases the guidance corridor for the EBIT margin of the  Automotive Segment from between 7% and 9% to between 9.5% and 10.5%  for the financial year 2021. Additionally, the guidance corridor for  the Return on Equity for the Financial Services Segment is revised  from between 17% and 20% to between 20% and 23%. Whilst the semiconductor supply restrictions are expected to further  impact production and deliveries to customers in the coming months,  BMW AG expects that the continuing positive pricing effects for both  new and pre-owned vehicles will overcompensate these negative sales  volume effects in the current financial year. The positive earnings effects will positively impact Group earnings  before taxes which remain forecast to increase significantly. The Free  Cash Flow in the Automotive Segment is now expected to be around € 6.5 billion. The definition of the above-mentioned financial indicators is  provided in the glossary of the BMW Group Report 2020 on pages 326 to 329.The Quarterly Statement to 30 September 2021 will be published on 3 November 2021.  For further questions please contact: Corporate Communications Dr Britta Ullrich, Communications FinanceE-mail: britta.ullrich@bmwgroup.com, Telephone: +49 89-382-18364 Eckhard Wannieck, Head of Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesE-mail: eckhard.wannieck@bmw.de,  Telephone: +49 89 382-24544 Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail: presse@bmwgroup.com   The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Superblue and BMW i present    “No One is an Island”, a collaboration between the  art group Random International and choreographer Wayne McGregor and  his company. On the occasion of Frieze London, the performance will be  shown publicly from October 13 to 16 daily between 3:00 and 7:00pm at  Park Village Studios.Random International, Studio Wayne McGregor, Superblue and BMW i  share a passion for pushing boundaries and exploring new territories.  All are moved by similar questions about how future generations will  interact with automated and digitised processes and environments  whilst embracing reduction and sustainability. For this purpose, they  are collaborating on a special project: “No One is an Island”.  Conceptualised as a “Gesamtkunstwerk”, “No One is an Island” is  developed in an ongoing dialogue and exchange between artists and partners.“No One is an Island” is fuelled by science and explores electrified  movement steered by advanced algorithms. It is a future-oriented  reflection on how the human mind empathises with artificial  intelligence and automated processes. The performance comprises  sculptural, performative, and musical aspects.The centrepiece is a sculpture by Random  International that experiments with the minimal amount of  information that is actually necessary for an animated form to be  recognised as human;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Between elves and trolls: In the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 through Iceland's Wild West.;If you want to explore the world, you need a thirst for knowledge, a  thirst for adventure and a four-wheel drive MINI Countryman. With it, you can travel safely even where more than half of the country's  inhabitants firmly believe in the existence of supernatural beings - in  Iceland. Especially a trip to the Westfjords, which are little developed  for tourists, brings visitors closer to the life and culture of the  islanders and breathtaking nature. ;"Reykjavik. Anyone who wanted to know where elves,  fairies, gnomes or trolls lived could once ask Erla Stefansdottir. She  was Iceland's elf commissioner and often advised the building  authority so that new roads would not cross magical places. In this  respect, when travelling by car from the capital Reykjavik along the  few paved and unpaved roads to the most westerly places in Europe, one  need not fear waking sleeping supernatural beings. Especially not in  the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 (fuel consumption combined: 6.5 -  6.2/100 km according to EU, CO2 149 - 142 g/km).If you want to experience Iceland, you can't avoid using part of the  Ring Road 1 from the capital Reykjavik. Even here, the MINI Cooper S  Countryman ALL4 with its smooth-running two-litre four-cylinder engine  shows just how good it is to travel with 131 kW/178 hp. The MINI  Cooper S Countryman ALL4 - supported by the eightspeed Steptronic  gearbox - accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 7.3 seconds. However, it  cannot live up to its possible top speed of 222 km/h because more than  90 km/h is not permitted anywhere. On gravel roads - and there are  many of them, as in Iceland only about 4300 kilometres of road are  asphalted - the maximum speed is 80 km/h, and even that can be too fast.Heading west, the ""1"" first takes island explorers to  Bogarnes, the economic centre of West Iceland with a fabulous  panoramic view. The town's hot water comes from Iceland's largest hot  water spring, Deildartunguhver, with 180 litres per second. From here,  it is worth taking a detour along highway 54 to the  167-square-kilometre Snaefellsjökull National Park, dominated by a  1446-metre-high volcanic cone. Thousands of seabirds populate the  Londrangar rock towers. Also worth seeing is Dritvik Bay with the  ruins of the only fishing station and the black lava gravel beach of Djupalonssandur.Even though many paths along the coasts can only be explored by feet,  the ALL4 all-wheel drive system provides Icelanders with the best  traction wherever cars are allowed to drive. After all, loose ground  and water crossings are commonplace on almost every tour in  Iceland.The system is based on an electromechanically operating centre  differential that distributes the drive power continuously between the  front and rear axles - depending on requirements. Up to 100 percent  can be directed to the rear";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The hallmark of the beauty contest is passion for elegant  coachworks and timelessly beautiful designs. For organizational  reasons and due to attendance limits dictated by the anti-covid rules  the public event in the parkland of Villa Erba and the Concorso di  Motociclette are not being held in 2021.The organisers ask for understanding in relation to the unusual form  of the event this year and will enable the loyal public to follow the  legendary parade of cars from 2.00 to 4.00 p.m. on Saturday 2nd  October 2021 in a livestream on the website https://www.concorsodeleganzavilladeste.com/Jeff Koons will give initial insights into his project with BMW at a  Closed Room presentation of THE 8X JEFF KOONS, his limited edition of  the M850i xDrive Gran Coupé. The result of this collaboration embodies  precision, refinement and craft artistry, and it is a perfect match  with the atmosphere of the Renaissance residence on the shores of Lake  Como. Jeff Koons will join together with the Head of BMW Group Design,  Adrian van Hooydonk, to talk about the connection between art and  mobility, inspiration and creativity, and interaction between these  different areas.This year, the Head of BMW Group Classic, Helmut Käs, is taking over  the Presidency of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este from Ulrich  Knieps, who defined the prestigious event from 2014 to 2020, and who  will also be present at this year’s edition.About 50 exclusively selected Historic Cars will be shown in eight  classes at this edition of the Concorso d´Eleganza.

The vision car has been consistently designed on the  basis of the principles of the circular economy. The aim is to achieve  100 percent use of recycled materials and 100 percent recyclability.  The BMW Group intends to become the most successful and most  sustainable premium manufacturer for individual mobility. That’s why  the company is adopting a responsible approach and placing these  issues at the centre of its strategy. The BMW i Vision Circular also  demonstrates that a premium aspiration need not be a contradiction  with sustainability.The worldwide debut of the Rolls-Royce Boat Tail in the Mosaic Garden  of Villa d’Este will undoubtedly create a sensation. This is an  initial apogee of a coachbuilding project over four years with three  unusual Rolls-Royce clients. A personalised automobile of superlative  excellence has been designed for each one. The convertible has a  length of 5.80 m and comes from the British luxury marque with a long  “Boat Tail” designed like a yacht to provide a perfect accompaniment  for the journey along the fabulous winding road on the banks of Lake Como.This year, the programme of the Concorso d´Eleganza will once again  be defined by the exhibition of participating cars, the exquisite  aesthetics of their styling and contours, and the crowning of the most  elegant and technically excellent winners of the beauty contest by the  Jury. The winners of the Coppa d´Oro Villa d´Este will receive their  award on Saturday and the winners of the various vehicle classes, the  Concorso d’Eleganza Design Award and the Best of Show Award for the  overall winner of all classes will be presented on Sunday.Once again this year, we would like to extend our thanks to our loyal  partners A.

Smart plant logistics: Automated transport systems for outdoor use; Outdoor tugger trains, car box and car trailer piloted in outdoor areas at Plant Dingolfing ;"Dingolfing. At BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, automated  transport systems have long been an essential part of plant  operations: From autonomous tugger trains to smart transport robots to  car forklifts – rollout of these innovative vehicles is well underway,  and they have already become a common sight in production halls. “Due  to the wide variety of models we have here in Dingolfing, from the BMW  4 Series to the fully-electric BMW iX, our assembly logistics  currently handles different articles and part” explains Armin Feser,  head of Physical Logistics at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. “Automated  transport systems help us manage this complexity and organise our  logistics processes at the plant more efficiently.”After using these innovative vehicles indoors, the next step is to  deploy automated transport systems in areas outside the production  halls. Pilot projects have been running on the plant grounds for  several weeks – with two automated outdoor tugger trains, a so-called  car box and a car trailer.Peter Kiermaier is responsible for logistics planning and  industrialisation of logistics innovations at Plant Dingolfing. He  firmly believes these vehicles have potential for the future, but also  describes the unique challenges of using them outdoors: “On the one  hand, because of the weather, we have far more disruptive and  influencing factors, so we need more robust sensors and systems. On  the other, we also need vehicles and systems that can communicate and  interact effectively with each another.”He says protecting other road users, such as pedestrians and  cyclists, is top priority and requires the innovative vehicle to be  integrated into the existing traffic control system.As part of the AC Log (Autonomous & Connected Logistics) research  project, plans call for the car trailer and car box to be connected to  5G, so they can communicate with the existing BMW standard control system.Specifically, two different outdoor tugger train models are currently  being piloted: The first is a tugger train built by Linde, with an  integrated automation kit from Schiller and a traction of three  tonnes, which is being used to transport door handles autonomously,  without a driver, in covered open spaces. The second model, from  French manufacturer Easymile, builds on lessons learned from vehicle  technology for autonomous driving and is mainly being used to  transport PHS sheet metal parts outdoors. The electric hauler delivers  up to 15 tonnes of traction and, with three trailers, reaches a length  of over 16 metres and an automated speed of 10 km/h. It comes with a  complex navigation system that uses GPS satellite navigation and Lidar  technology to create a 3D image of the surroundings.An automated, self-driving car box from Stäubli-WFT is also being  piloted. With a footprint of 4.5 x 2 metres and a housing to protect  transported goods from the weather, it is ideally equipped for outdoor  use. The self-driving box moves special containers back and forth  between locations where empty containers are stored and returned in  the northern sector of Plant 02.40. “The product represents a further  development of the previous indoor vehicle used at the Dingolfing  Dynamics Centre 02.70. In the long run, we want to achieve greater  flexibility by using different vehicle sizes and transport  volumes,"" explains Dr Thomas Irrenhauser, head of Technology  Development Innovation.Another device from Stäubli-WFT, the car trailer, is currently in use  at the Dynamics Centre (DYZ). In the near future, two automated car  trailers will be deployed at this location to move containers arriving  by rail to the docking gates for outgoing goods at the container yard,  some 500 metres away, instead of tractor units. There, the container  will be loaded with new parts, which are then transported back to the  container yard by the car trailer, where they wait to be shipped.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The US and    European teams produced an emotional battle at the spectacular    Whistling Straits golf course in the US state of Wisconsin. Many of    the matches were closer than the final result of 19-9 initially    indicates. The hosts led from day one and showed little if any    weakness, while the Europeans never managed to shift momentum in    their favour.“Congratulations to the United States team on winning the Ryder Cup  after an exciting competition,” said Stefan Ponikva, Vice President  Brand Communication and Brand Experience BMW Group. “This past week in  Whistling Straits has shown once again why the Ryder Cup is able to  captivate so many people all over the world, and why it is a sporting  event like no other. As Worldwide Partner, BMW has underlined its  status as an outstanding partner for the game of golf. With the  ‘Ultimate Journey,’ we have created an unforgettable moment.”The Americans, who were able to call upon the services of eighth of  the world’s top ten, lived up to their billing as favourites from the  first tee shot and led by 11:5 after the doubles matches. Captain  Steve Stricker’s team was also by far the stronger in the singles and  pushed on to win by the biggest margin since 1979, the first time a  European team appeared in the Ryder Cup. The biggest victory prior to  this year’s event was a 18.5:9.5 achieved by Europe in 2006 and 2004  and the USA in 1981.One of the few bright spots for the defending champions was Sergio  García, who set a new record on Saturday morning with his  24th match win, passing the previous record holder Sir Nick  Faldo (ENG). Over the course of his career, which spans ten Ryder Cup  appearances, the Spaniard has now won 25 matches and scored 28.5  points – also a record.The BMW Group can look back on a partnership with the Ryder Cup that  dates back to 2006. The premium automobile manufacturer was Worldwide  Partner of the Ryder Cup for the first time this year, and will also  be when the competition is staged again in two years' time in Rome  (ITA). For the last week, a fleet of over 200 cars from the current  BMW range has provided a premium shuttle service. 400 BMW guests have  enjoyed an exclusive programme and the best possible view of the  16th green from the BMW Hospitality. The first all-electric  BMW i4 Gran Coupé was on display at the tournament site, as was the  wingsuit and trophy case, which played key roles alongside Peter  Salzmann on the trophy’s “Ultimate Journey” to the opening ceremony.Equipped with wingsuits in a Ryder Cup design and a case for the  Ryder Cup trophy, designed specifically for this purpose by BMW Group  Designworks, the Austrian and his team leapt out of a helicopter 3,000  metres above the earth, making for some spectacular images. After a  two-minute flight over Whistling Straits, at a top speed of 230 km/h,  Salzmann and the legendary trophy were chauffeured to the opening  ceremony in a BMW iX – the BMW Group’s fully-electric technology  flagship. The “Ultimate Journey” ended with Salzmann delivering the  trophy to the stage to great applause.

Ethiopians Adola and Gebreslase triumphed at the tenth staging of    the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON with BMW as title partner. Bernhard Kuhnt,    BMW Group Senior Vice President Market Germany, and BMW Brand    Ambassador Lena Gercke gave the starting signal for the 25, 000    athletes, including 200 employees of the BMW Group. “Congratulations to Guye Adola and Gotytom Gebreslase on their  outstanding performances – but also to the entire running community,  who were finally able to take on and conquer the BMW BERLIN-MARATHON  again. We are also delighted that we could all celebrate the 10th  anniversary of BMW as title partner together,” said Bernhard Kuhnt,  BMW Group Senior Vice President Market Germany. “We would like to  thank the many volunteers, as well as our partner SCC EVENTS for once  again organising an outstanding sporting event and developing an  excellent hygiene concept to ensure the safety and health of all involved.”Thirty-year-old Adola, who was runner-up in Berlin four years ago,  took victory ahead of Kenya’s Bethwel Yegon, who crossed the finish  line at the Brandenburg Gate after 2:06.14 hours of running. There was  disappointment for Kenenisa Bekele. The Ethiopian superstar had to  settle for third place (2:06.47) after a failed attempt to break the  world record of Eliud Kipchoge (KEN), who set a stunning time of  2:01.39 hours at the 2018 BMW BERIN-MARATHON. In late-summer weather,  with temperatures above 20 degrees Celsius in the latter stages of the  elite race, there was no chance of a new record this time.It was a top-class debut from Gotytom Gebreslase, who surprised the  favourites to take victory in a time of 2:20.09 hours. This is the  third-fastest time in the world this year. Second place went to Hiwot  Gebrekidan in 2:21.23, followed by Helen Tola (2:23.05) who crossed  the finish line third to make it an all-Ethiopian top three.The innovative and successful efforts of the BMW Group to implement  the mobility of the future were again a leading feature of this year’s  BMW BERLIN-MARATHON. The full range of all-electric models from the  BMW Group were involved as lead cars and safety cars: the technology  flagship BMW iX*, the first all-electric BMW i4 Gran Coupé*, the  Sports Activity Vehicle BMW iX3* and the BMW i3s*, whose predecessors  have been on the market since 2013.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Fatal accident overshadows WorldSBK race weekend in Jerez de la Frontera.;The tenth race weekend of the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) was overshadowed by a fatal accident involving Spain’s Dean Berta Viñales. After the tragic accident, all the remaining races scheduled for Saturday were cancelled. Sunday’s itinerary was amended to feature two 20-lap WorldSBK races.;Jerez de la Frontera. The tenth race weekend of the 2021 FIM    Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Jerez de la Frontera    (ESP) was overshadowed by a fatal accident involving Spain’s Dean    Berta Viñales. The young rider crashed in Saturday’s Supersport 300 race.    The thoughts of BMW Motorrad Motorsport are with Viñales’ family, friends and team. We would like to offer them our    sincere condolences. After the tragic accident, all the remaining races scheduled for  Saturday were cancelled. In consultation with Viñales’ family, it was  decided to continue the race weekend on Sunday and to stage the races  in memory of the young rider. On Sunday morning, the paddock paid its  respects with a minute’s silence. Sunday’s itinerary was amended to  feature two 20-lap WorldSBK races. Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team ended  race one in seventh place. He then finished eighth in race two.  Deputizing for Van der Mark’s team-mate, Tom Sykes (GBR), in Jerez de  la Frontera was Eugene Laverty (IRL). In light of the injury that  Sykes suffered last Sunday in Barcelona, the decision was taken for  him to sit out the Jerez weekend. Laverty was 12th and 11th in the two  races. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team finished  14th in race one and crossed the finish line 13th in race two. Quotes after the races at Jerez de la Frontera. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  sad news of Dean Berta Viñales’ death was a shock to all of us. On  behalf of BMW Motorrad Motorsport, I would like to express our sincere  sympathy to his relatives. It was not easy to get back to the sporting  action after this tragic accident. “Regarding our weekend: I think we do have solid results with seventh  and eighth, which I am pleased with. However, the weekend was  compromised by a not so good qualifying with all the BMWs starting  from the fifth row. So Michael starting from 13th and ending up in  seventh and eighth was definitely a solid performance. The gap to the  podium was not so big. So we have to work on our qualifying  performance and then we can make the next step. Jonas definitely had  two of his better races. He was right up there with Eugene. For  Eugene, of course, it was difficult to jump on the bike again after  missing some rounds. We tried hard to get him a good feeling on the  bike, but did not entirely get there. Both of them, Eugene and Jonas,  were about 27 to 30 seconds off the win, which is for Jonas definitely  one of the best results he has had this year. It is pleasing to see  that he is going forward.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “First of all commiserations to the Viñales family. It was  devastating news yesterday. I think the paddock has really pulled  together and raced today in memory of Dean. It is sad to be racing  under these circumstances. “Mickey really struggled in qualifying yesterday. It is clear that we  couldn’t master the two Qs he had, so starting from that grid position  was always going to be a challenge. We did not expect to get to the  top eight, but he was seventh and eighth, battling his way through. It  is quite clear that when you are coming from so far back you are using  the best of your tyre to get into that position, and at the end you  have nothing to fight with. He just defended his position. Mickey has  had a very strong Sunday. Eugene came back after a longer lay-off,  stood in for Tom, and I have to say that he has done a great job. He  did two great races. He quickly made up the places that he was able  to. He got his head down and really ground through the laps, as we  know how he can do in race conditions, and he came away with two  strong positions. Now we bring the curtain down on what has been a  really difficult weekend for everybody in the WorldSBK paddock and  move on to Portugal.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was a difficult weekend for the WorldSBK paddock. I want to express my  condolences to Dean’s family and friends. Today we raced for him. Our  results haven’t been bad when you see where we came from. Yesterday, I  had no confidence to go faster so I was a bit disappointing. After a  lot of studying the data the guys changed a lot on the bike and  already this morning in warm-up I felt a big improvement. Also in both  of today’s races I felt a massive step forward. And if you look at our  lap times, the consistency and also the gap to the winner and the  podium guys, I think we made a solid step. That gives me a lot of  confidence and that is what we need. We have tried some things that  will for sure be helping in the future.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First of  all, my thoughts are with Dean’s family and friends and I’d like to  express my condolences to them. It was a shock for all of us when we  heard of the tragic loss of such a young life yesterday. Sporting  wise, my objective was to be closer to the front, so I’m disappointed  with the race results. We were working all weekend to get the bike to  feel more like the bike that I had in the second half of last year and  the first half of this year, but it just felt like a different bike  under acceleration. Something was amiss in terms of power delivery on  corner exit and we didn’t have enough time on track to really get to  the bottom of it. I did what I could and a big thank you to BMW  Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team for allowing me  to come back for this weekend.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was not easy to  focus on the job at hand again today. A crash with fatal consequences  is not easy to block out. My deepest sympathy goes to the relatives of  Dean Berta Viñales. From my own perspective, I am really happy with my  races today. The early laps did not go as I hoped, as I was struggling  with the new tyres, which lost their grip very quickly and were very  erratic. However, after five or six laps I was able to establish my  rhythm and could feel the bike better. After race one we knew what we  had to do. I battled against good people and could see where the  differences were. I then carried a lot of confidence into race two. I  again had difficulties with the new tyres in the first few laps, but  then rode a great race. I was able to overtake and, towards the end,  bridged the gap to Leon Haslam and Eugene Laverty. That showed how  much better things were this weekend than they have been. We took a  step forward, which is nice to see.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Junior Team races the BMW M6 GT3 to the podium also at NLS 8 – New BMW M4 GT3 finishes in fifth place.;In beautiful late summer weather, the BMW Junior Team finished round eight of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) on the podium. After four hours of racing, Neil Verhagen (USA), Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) crossed the finish line in third place in the # 44 BMW M6 GT3. The new BMW M4 GT3 took the chequered flag in fifth place. The #55 car was driven by Philipp Eng (AUT) and Augusto Farfus (BRA).;Nürburg. In beautiful late summer weather, the BMW Junior Team finished    round eight of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) on the    Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) on the podium. After four hours of    racing, Neil Verhagen (USA), Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER)    crossed the finish line in third place in the # 44 BMW M6 GT3. In    the end, the trio was only 14 hundredths of a second short of second    place. The new BMW M4 GT3 took the chequered flag in fifth place.    The #55 car was driven by Philipp Eng (AUT) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). In qualifying on Saturday morning, that had to be shortened to 45  minutes due to fog, the BMW Juniors secured third on the grid. The  start of the race was postponed by half an hour to 12:30. In the  turmoil of the first corners the #44 BMW M6 GT3 initially fell back to  sixth place, but Verhagen, Harper and Hesse quickly worked their way  back towards the front. In the exciting final stages, Hesse put the  second placed Audi in front of him under massive pressure, but he  couldn’t find the opportunity to overtake, and this was also due to  Code 60 zones. After four hours, the #44 BMW M6 GT3 crossed the line  in third. After the wins in races four and five and second place in  round seven, this was the next podium success for the BMW Junior Team. The #55 BMW M4 GT3 once again took part out of competition in the  prototype class SP-X. Because of this, Eng and Farfus started the race  behind the field of SP9 cars. In its second race the new car again ran  without any problems and improved position by position. After four  hours of racing, Farfus took the flag in fifth place. The gap to the  front was only 86 seconds.  Walkenhorst Motorsport finished third in the SP9 Am class with the  #36 BMW. The car was driven by Henry Walkenhorst, Friedrich von Bohlen  and Jörg Breuer (all GER). The team’s #34 BMW M6 GT3, with David  Pittard (GBR), Ben Tuck (GBR) and Christian Krognes (NOR) at the  wheel, was in second place after a fantastic start. Pittard also set a  new NLS lap record in 7:53.202 minutes. But then, the #34 fell far  back due to a damaged tyre. In the different classes, the BMW M Motorsport teams claimed a total  of four class wins. The season finale of the 2021 Nürburgring  Endurance Series will be held in two weeks’ time, on 9th October. Reactions after round eight of the 2021 NLS. Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “It has been a  great and for us an entirely positive day of racing in the Eifel  mountains. It started with the fact that spectators were again allowed  onto the starting grid. That made the atmosphere very special. The  race itself once again went smoothly. Our BMW Juniors Neil, Dan and  Max put in another great performance, and Max’s fight for second place  in the final laps was really breathtaking. It didn’t quite work out,  but third place is another great result. Also Philipp’s and Augusto’s  race in the new BMW M4 GT3 was fantastic. Both once again confirmed  that the handling and performance of the new car are excellent. The  BMW M4 GT3 is fast and easy to drive. Overall, the race went  trouble-free for us from A to Z. I would like to thank the entire  development team, BMW Team RMG, the drivers and everyone involved in  the project for their great work.” Max Hesse, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “We gave  our everything and a couple of times it could have nearly worked out.  But in the end, the Audi had a bit more top speed than us, and exiting  the Code 60 zone at the Döttinger Höhe there was no chance. And we all  know: to overtake on the Nordschleife is not the easiest task. But it  is great to be on the podium again. We also collected good points for  the championship – the fight is on!” Neil Verhagen, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “We  are happy with another podium. We have now been on the podium  regularly after the 24-hour race. This is good;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
“The Ultimate Journey”: Worldwide Ryder Cup Partner BMW gives the prestigious trophy a fitting journey to the opening ceremony.;Few sporting events combine an intense atmosphere, sporting drama and excellence, and global interest in the same way as the Ryder Cup has done since 1927. The ‘Ultimate Journey’ to the opening ceremony, for which Worldwide Partner BMW, BMW Group Designworks and the team around wingsuit pilot Peter Salzmann (AUT) chose the skies above Wisconsin as the stage, was equally spectacular.;Few sporting events combine an intense atmosphere, sporting    drama and excellence, and global interest in the same way as the    Ryder Cup has done since 1927. The ‘Ultimate Journey’ to the opening    ceremony, for which Worldwide Partner BMW, BMW Group Designworks and    the team around wingsuit pilot Peter Salzmann (AUT) chose the skies    above Wisconsin as the stage, was equally spectacular.Equipped with a wingsuit in a Ryder Cup design, as well as a  transport capsule for the trophy, specially developed by BMW Group  Designworks for that purpose, Salzmann and his team leapt out of a  helicopter from 3,000 metres above sea level. The Ryder Cup Trophy  Case was fastened to the Austrian’s body using a construction that  guaranteed him the necessary freedom of movement and also had the  required aerodynamic properties. This made it possible to land safely  with the trophy after two minutes of flying, despite a top speed of  230 km/h, before it was driven in its case to the opening ceremony at  Whistling Straits in the BMW Group’s fully-electric technology  flagship, the BMW iX xDrive50*. The Ultimate Journey ended with  Salzmann carrying the trophy onto the stage at the opening ceremony.“The Ryder Cup is of significant importance in the golfing and  sporting world. This contest casts its spell over the competitors and  teams, just as it does the enthusiastic spectators at the course and  the many fans watching from the edge of their seats all over the  world,” said Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand Communication and  Brand Experience BMW Group. “To acknowledge the prominent position of  this competition, and to celebrate the premiere of BMW as Worldwide  Partner of the Ryder Cup, we wanted to make the arrival of the trophy  particularly special. To do so, we created a unique case for the  trophy, which is both innovative and representative.”The chief criterion when developing the trophy case was to protect  the Ryder Cup during the stunt. At the same time, it had to guarantee  the freedom to move for the wingsuit pilot, as well as optimal  aerodynamic properties. Furthermore, it should be an emotive design,  which continues to represent the status of the trophy and the event  even after the stunt – the challenge was to create a product that is  innovative, luxurious and inspiring, and thus reflects the spirit of  BMW i. A challenge tailor-made for Designworks, the innovative engine  of the BMW Group, with its expertise in bringing together the needs of  mobility and other sectors.“When asked to work on this project connected to the historical Ryder  Cup event it was something that excited me to be part of. We just knew  it had to be a product that blends the BMW i excitement for technology  with the prestigious and honourable aspects surrounding the event  itself,” said Tommy Forsgren, Designworks Lead Designer. “The case  design is a true innovative BMW i product – its premium qualities and  exclusivity matching the new BMW iX in terms of colour and material finish.”The trophy case consists of an outer aluminium frame and a 3D printed  space frame capsule with large gaps, allowing the Ryder Cup trophy to  be seen, even when closed and during the flight. The case can be  attached to the interior skeleton of the wingsuit just as quickly as  it can to a wall – for example, for exhibition purposes. The opening  mechanism is like that found on a wing door.The Ryder Cup is not the first project, on which BMW i, BMW Group  Designworks and Peter Salzmann have collaborated. Together, they  developed the ‘Electrified Wingsuit by BMW i’: an innovative, electric  drive module and a wingsuit designed from scratch allowed Salzmann to  fulfil his dream of developing his sport and breaking new ground with  sophisticated drive technology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Marco Wittmann (GER) celebrated his second win of the season on the  sixth DTM race weekend. The two-time DTM champion delivered a  sensational performance in a chaotic Saturday race at Assen, the  ‘Cathedral of Speed’. Starting from second on the grid, he secured the  win at the wheel of his #11 BMW M6 GT3 from the Walkenhorst Motorsport  team, even overcoming a five-second penalty during the closing stage  of the race. “My team and I decided to make our mandatory pit stop a  little later,” said Wittmann. “That was a key moment, as the fresher  tyres meant that we could attack the other cars in front of me. I gave  it everything in that manoeuvre against Liam Lawson and risked the  lot, a decision for which I was later penalised. It is a great feeling  to be able to win despite this, and it is a fantastic team  performance.” In the #31 BMW M6 GT3 from ROWE Racing, Sheldon van der  Linde (RSA) also scored points in sixth place, while team-mate Timo  Glock (GER) was forced to retire in the #16 BMW M6 GT3. Wittmann gave another impressive performance on Sunday. Having  started the race from second on the grid once again, he was able to  reach third place and claim his fifth podium of the season despite  carrying 25 kilos of additional weight. Glock finished the race in  14th place, while van der Linde had to head for the pits and retire early.Wittmann has now made up some ground on his rivals in the  drivers’ standings, moving up to second place overall after six of  eight race weekends, ten points behind the leader.

This represented a first win in the one-make cup for Caresani, who  nearly repeated the feat in Sunday's race. He defended first place  until the closing stage of the race, before yielding to race winner  Oeverhaus in the #34 BMW M2 CS Racing. “I am over the moon,” said  Oeverhaus, who had started the race from eighth on the grid. “At the  start, I would never have thought it would go so well today. It is  really difficult to overtake on this circuit but then it went better  than I had thought. My car really was perfect – thanks to the team for  that.” Louis Henkefend (GER) crossed the line in third place to extend  his lead in the overall standings. The final race weekend in the BMW  M2 Cup takes place from 8th to 10th October at the Norisring (GER). You can find more information about the BMW M2 Cup on the official  website bmwm2cup.com.

Difficult WorldSBK Sunday for BMW Motorrad Motorsport in Barcelona.;For BMW Motorrad Motorsport, Sunday’s action in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Barcelona (ESP) was overshadowed by a heavy crash involving Tom Sykes (GBR) in race two. The British rider was taken to hospital for further checks as a precaution after initial examinations at the Medical Centre revealed that he had suffered a concussion.;Barcelona. For BMW Motorrad Motorsport, Sunday’s action in the    FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Barcelona (ESP) was    overshadowed by a heavy crash involving Tom Sykes (GBR) in race two.    The British rider was taken to hospital for further checks as a    precaution after initial examinations at the Medical Centre revealed    that he had suffered a concussion. His team-mate from the BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Michael van der Mark (NED), completed the    second race in ninth position. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo    MGM Racing team crossed the line in 16th place. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had already endured some poor luck in  the morning’s Superpole race. Van der Mark fell on the first lap,  sending Sykes into the gravel trap. Both riders headed for the pits.  After three laps, the race was suspended after another accident.  However, according to the regulations, neither BMW Motorrad WorldSBK  Team rider was allowed to compete in the restart. The sprint race was  shortened to five laps, with Folger finishing in 13th place. This  meant P10 for Sykes, P13 for van der Mark and P18 for Folger on the  grid for race two. At the beginning of the second race, Sykes fell and was then hit by  another rider. Sykes was taken to the circuit’s medical centre, where  initial diagnoses revealed a concussion. Further precautionary  investigations have since taken place in a Barcelona hospital. The accident led to the suspension of the race, which restarted after  a delay. Van der Mark crossed the line in ninth place. Folger secured  16th position. The WorldSBK now travels to Jerez de le Frontera in  southern Spain, where the tenth round of the season will take place  next weekend. Quotes after race two at Barcelona. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Our  main concern is that Tom is well. He is conscious and in hospital for  further checks at the moment. We have our fingers firmly crossed that  he has come through the crash relatively unscathed. It was not an easy  day. Unfortunately, Mickey also took out Tom when he crashed in this  morning’s Superpole race. As they had already completed three laps by  the time the red flag appeared, we were unfortunately unable to join  in when the Superpole race re-started. In race two, Tom fell and was  then unfortunately hit by another rider. Mickey was ninth in race two.  They were probably difficult conditions for many riders, but that was  obviously not the result we were striving for. It was a difficult end  to a weekend that actually started very positively.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “First of all, our thoughts are with Tom today. He has gone  for further checks at Barcelona Hospital. He has been talking and is  conscious which is a good sign so we will wait for further  information, however this really casts a shadow over the whole day. In  the Superpole race, both riders equally went down from an accident  caused by Mickey, which he has sincerely apologized to the team for.  In the second feature race, I think Mickey struggled to get his tyre  to work for him very early in the race but come the final third, he  had pace which was getting him where we expected him to be sort of the  third, fourth, fifth, sixth position, but by that point it was too  late, so it’s a scant reward for his weekend’s work in 9th position.  Now we will draw a line under Catalunya 2021 and move forward to  Jerez. But the main thing today is that we wish Tom a speedy recovery.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning in the Superpole race I made a mistake. I tried  to overtake Tom, but I was too fast and crashed and pushed Tom into  the gravel. It was a stupid mistake, so I am really sorry to the team.  In race two, I got a reasonable start, but unfortunately the red flag  was brought out because of Tom’s crash, from which I hope he is OK. At  the restart I struggled with the bike;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIM EWC: BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team forced to prematurely give up the fight for the podium at the Bol d’Or.;After stepping onto the podium in the previous two races of the 2021 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team was fighting for positions at the very top again at the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet (FRA). But the 24-hour race came to a premature end for the squad. During the night, the team had to retire due to a technical issue.;Le Castellet. After stepping onto the podium in the previous    two races of the 2021 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC),    the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team was fighting for positions at    the very top again at the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet (FRA). But the    24-hour race came to a premature end for the squad. During the    night, the team had to retire due to a technical issue. Markus    Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Kenny Foray (FRA) had    shared duties in the saddle of the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. After seven and a half hours of racing, the team was running in  fourth position when Mikhalchik had issues with the power train and  had to bring the bike back to the garage. Team Manager Werner Daemen’s  squad tried everything to continue the race but then had to make the  decision to retire. The cause of the issue will now be analysed in detail. Privateer BMW Team LRP Poland was lying in 18th overall and in sixth  position in the EWC class with the #90 BMW S 1000 RR after 21 hours of  racing. Tecmas BMW (#9 BMW S 1000 RR) had to retire after a crash. The 84th edition of the Bol d’Or was the third round of the FIM EWC  2021 season. The final round, the 8-hour race at Most in the Czech  Republic, will be held on 9th October. Reactions. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “This  obviously is a hard setback for us, also in regards of the title fight  in the world championship. Another podium finish with a lot of  championship points would have been possible in this 24-hour race but  endurance racing once more proved that a lot can happen. Several top  teams have run into issues in this very hard race, and unfortunately  we have been one of them. We will now analyse in detail to find the  exact cause of the issue. I want to thank the entire team and the  riders for their very hard work before and at the race weekend. Now we  are looking forward to the finale at Most. There, we want to attack  again and fight at the very top.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “It’s very sad, for the riders and our entire team who all  worked so hard, but it can happen. We will leave that behind us and  our full focus is now on the next round at Most.” Markus Reiterberger: “We of course are all very  disappointed. The team tried everything to bring us back on track but  unfortunately we had to retire. It is very sad that the Le Castellet  weekend ended that way. But we will not get disheartened. Now, we will  prepare for Most where we will come back in full strength.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “We did a good job during this week.  We have again being always on top. In the race, we were running in P4,  just ten seconds behind P3. Our pace was very strong, like the leading  pace. Then we unfortunately suffered the technical issue. But okay, it  is endurance, and it’s a technical sport. Let’s forget this situation,  focus on the next one and prove that this team is capable of winning.” Kenny Foray: “For sure, it is very sad for us. I had  high hopes in the race, but it is like it is. We gave our very best  but this time it was not meant to be. It is difficult to find the  words to explain what I feel. It is not easy, but this is racing and  sometimes you win or are on the podium and sometimes you don’t finish.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WorldSBK Saturday at Barcelona: pole position for Tom Sykes, Michael van der Mark battling for a podium spot.;The Saturday at the Circuit de Catalunya began with pole position for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Tom Sykes (GBR) proved unbeatable in the Superpole on his BMW M 1000 RR as he claimed the sought-after spot at the front of the grid. In race one that afternoon, his team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) was involved in the battle to reach the podium and finished fifth on the wet circuit. Sykes crossed the finish line in eighth place.;Barcelona. The Saturday at the Circuit de Catalunya began with    pole position for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Tom Sykes (GBR)    proved unbeatable in the Superpole on his BMW M 1000 RR as he    claimed the sought-after spot at the front of the grid. In race one    that afternoon, his team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) was    involved in the battle to reach the podium and finished fifth on the    wet circuit. Sykes crossed the finish line in eighth place. Jonas    Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing Team finished the first race    in 19th position. Sykes posted a time of 1:40.408 minutes, nearly three-tenths of a  second faster than his rivals, to claim his third pole position with  BMW in the morning Superpole qualification session, his 51st WorldSBK  pole overall. Van der Mark qualified in ninth place. Folger finished  the Superpole in 18th position. The weekend at Barcelona had been dry thus far, but rain set in just  as the grid was forming up for race one. The riders chose wet-weather  tyres to deal with the conditions around the circuit. Pole-sitter Sykes endured some bad luck at the start. His rear wheel  started spinning on the paint as he pulled away, dropping him back  down to 15th place. Van der Mark remained in ninth after the start,  before starting to make his move up through the field. He had reached  fifth place by lap two and moved into fourth with a great manoeuvre on  lap seven. He was now battling for a podium finish and moved to within  0.1 seconds of the top three. When leader Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR /  Yamaha) retired on the 15th lap, van der Mark was able to claim third  for a while before dropping two places. Van der Mark then closed up on  Jonathan Rea (GBR / Kawasaki) again during the final laps, before  crossing the line in fifth place, six and a half seconds behind winner  Scott Redding (GBR / Ducati). On lap one, Sykes moved up from 15th to  tenth place. He then returned to the top eight on the next lap and  completed the race in eighth position. Folger finished a difficult  race in 19th position. Quotes after race one at Barcelona. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Overall, that was a mixed day for us. Of course, it was  fantastic for Tom to get pole position in Superpole and we are also  very pleased with Michael’s performance in the race having started  from ninth and was then involved in the battle for the podium.  Unfortunately, his tyres started to wear during the final laps. But he  did cross the line just a few seconds off the podium places. This is  good, and means we have one good race in the bag. Unfortunately, Tom  had some bad luck at the start and wasn’t able to turn his pole  position into a result. It was a shame that he fell back so far. Now  we will see what the weather tomorrow brings. I will be heading on to  Le Castellet where we are competing in the Bol d’Or with the BMW  Motorrad World Endurance Team. I wish this team the very best of luck  as well, and we hope that regular rider Xavi Forés recovers from his  injuries swiftly.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Firstly, it was a great Superpole lap from Tom. An  unbelievable lap time. Mickey didn’t do so bad qualifying for the  third row in ninth. In race one, Tom unfortunately fell back to P15 at  the start. Mickey did well to break through from P9 and was almost in  the podium position, but it’s days like today where we need to take  our opportunity. We need to speak to the riders and get their  feedback, but P5 and P8 isn’t such a bad result. But Tom starting from  pole;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Qualifying at the Bol d’Or: BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team starts the 24-hour marathon from third on the grid.;The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team will start the Bol d’Or in Le Castellet (FRA), which is the third round of the 2021 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), from third on the grid with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR.;Le Castellet. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team will start    the Bol d’Or in Le Castellet (FRA), which is the third round of the    2021 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), from third on the    grid with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. Only the times of Markus    Reiterberger (GER) and Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) were classified for    qualifying, as the third regular rider, Xavi Forés (ESP), was unable    to participate after picking up an injury in Thursday’s practice    session in a crash that was not his fault. The team’s fourth rider,    Kenny Foray (FRA) will alternate with Reiterberger and Mikhalchik in    the race. Forés was hit and knocked off his bike by another rider in practice  and injured his shoulder in the fall. As he was unable to start in the  two qualifying sessions on Thursday and Friday, the grid position for  the #37 M RR was calculated taking the average of the fastest times  set by Reiterberger and Mikhalchik in their sessions. Reiterberger’s  best time of 1:53.617 minutes came on Friday morning, as did  Mikhalchik’s fastest lap of 1:53.623 minutes. This produced an average  time of 1:53.620 minutes. The 84th Bol d’Or gets underway at 15:00 CEST on Saturday 18th  September. The race finishes 24 hours later. The privateer BMW Team  LRP Poland (#90 BMW S 1000 RR) starts from ninth place, with Tecmas  BMW (#9 BMW S 1000 RR) 30th on the grid. Quotes after the Bol d’Or qualifying. Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “It has been a little bit mixed feelings, because on one side  we have Xavi’s injury, but, in general, I am very happy with  qualifying. As a team we are very strong. We did not use any  qualifying engine, but the lap times from Markus, Ilya and especially  Kenny, who is going to be our third rider in the race, were very good.  I am very happy to see that Kenny has the same rhythm as the others  and that he is in top form. Everything is well prepared and we are  ready to fight for the top places.” Markus Reiterberger: “Third place on the grid is  good, although I am not entirely satisfied with qualifying. I gave it  my all, but was a little unlucky with slipstreams. That is an  important factor here at this racetrack, especially when you are not  on a bike in special qualifying trim. We will now sit down together  and try to come up with the perfect package for the race. I think that  all three of us – Ilya, Kenny and myself – are superbly-set in terms  of our race pace. Unfortunately, Xavi cannot start. I wish him all the  best and a speedy recovery. It is going to be a long and hard race,  but we are ready.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am pretty happy with how the week  has gone so far. I feel good on the bike, even if it it’s not 100 per  cent perfect yet like it was at the test. We did not manage to put  together the ideal lap as we did at the test with Markus. But it is  good to start from P3 and we can rely on our strong race pace. We just  need to have a trouble-free race. We hope for good weather so we can  enjoy the riding during the 24-hours. So let’s see how it will go and  let’s fight until the end.” Xavi Forés: “Obviously, it was a bit unexpected for  me to finish the Bol d’Or weekend so early. It was a big shame to be  taken out on track due to another rider’s mistake and to not be able  to race this weekend. It also hurts especially as we are fighting for  the victory and for the title. So it’s not only painful for my  shoulder but also for my heart that I can’t help the team in that  task. My target is now to try to recover as fast as I can to be ready  and in a good shape for the season finale in Most. All the best to my  team-mates and to the team for the race – I cross my fingers for them  for another podium and more strong points for the championship.” Kenny Foray: “First of all, I am really sorry for  Xavi. That was not the plan and I know that it is very difficult for  him. I wish him a speedy recovery. I am ready for the race. I feel  good on the bike, I love this race, I love this track and I love this  bike. I will give my all and am confident that we can have a strong race.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

First, this weekend (17th to 19th September), is the ninth event of the season at Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona (ESP). Rounds ten and eleven of the season will then take place at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) and Portimão (POR).;Munich. For BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the action comes thick    and fast over the next few weeks in the FIM Superbike World    Championship (WorldSBK), with three race weekends in a row. First,    this weekend (17th to 19th September), is the ninth event of the    season at Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona (ESP). The BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team and its riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael    van der Mark (NED), as well as Bonovo MGM Racing and Jonas Folger    (GER), then head south to the Iberian Peninsula. Rounds ten and    eleven of the season will then take place at Jerez de la Frontera    (ESP) and Portimão (POR). Circuit de Catalunya hosted WorldSBK for the first time last year.  This spring, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Bonovo MGM Racing  completed extensive tests at Jerez de la Frontera and Barcelona, where  they prepared their BMW M 1000 RRs for the season ahead. The BMW  Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Sykes also attended another Barcelona test  in hot conditions this August. Jerez de la Frontera, where round ten of this season’s WorldSBK will  take place from 24th to 26th September, has been a fixture on the  calendar for many years. The same goes for Portimão on the Portuguese  Algarve, venue for the eleventh event of the season from 1st to 3rd  October.

With three back-to-back race  weekends, we have a demanding programme ahead of us. However, we are  looking forward to the challenge. Barcelona may still be a relatively  new hunting ground in WorldSBK, but we were already able to gather  important information there during this year’s tests to have a good  base. It was also helpful to get out on the track there in summery  conditions in August as we have to expect high temperatures at the  next races, especially at Jerez de la Frontera and Portimão. Our goal  is to get the triple-header off to a strong start with our M RRs in  Barcelona, then to carry the momentum into the remaining races in the  south of the Iberian Peninsula.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “At Magny-Cours, the two sides of the garage had different  issues but all are working to overcome that. The aim for the next race  at Barcelona and the coming triple-header is to build on our test work  that we did there in pre-season and recently with Tom also. We are  confident we can once again hit the ground running in FP1 with a very  good pace. We know that we can be competitive at Catalunya, we have  proved that in the past. The temperatures will be pretty high and we  know we need to manage that with the bike. Overall, we are keen to be  back on track again;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He synthesizes original composition, field recordings  and archival material to create sounds which place historical and  contemporary Black critical thought in a dialogue with the reality of  the world around us, and which open up new spaces for reflection  beyond this reality. For Preis der Nationalgalerie 2021, Fofana is  presenting the sound installations “BLUES” (2020) and “Ballad Air  & Fire” (2021), in which he incorporates light and scents as well  as videos and photography by his long-term collaborators Nicolas  Premier and Jim C. Nedd. In the installations, Fofana engages with key  texts dealing with the experiences of African people living in the  West–including works by Sylvia Wynter, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Amiri  Baraka–to create a multisensory space that fosters an active and  collective practice of listening.Calla Henkel & Max Pitegoff (born 1988 in  Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA / 1987 in Buffalo, New York, USA;" lives in  Berlin)Life in the diaspora and its psychological consequences,  as well as the legacy of the Cold War and its lasting effects on  global capitalism are all recurring themes in the work of Sung Tieu  (born 1987 in Hai Duong, Vietnam, lives in Berlin). In her works she  often interlinks fact and fiction, historical and biographical events,  and a diverse array of lived social experiences. The installation  “Song for VEB Stern-Radio Berlin” (2021) draws on her interest in the  history of Vietnamese contract workers in the GDR. By incorporating  radios manufactured by contract workers in Berlin, Tieu’s installation  alludes directly to the city and its Vietnamese community. The radios  activate the space acoustically and create a dense weave of  readymades, texts and sound that give occasion to think about the  relationship between work and life, and between individuals and systems. """;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Largest MINI Cooper SE fleet in Europe: One in four Deloitte employees in Belgium chooses a MINI Electric.;Deloitte orders 140 MINI Electric to meet growing demand for electric cars: MINI Electric largest order in Europe so far.;"More and more young people are opting for an electric company car: at  Deloitte alone, 26% of employees do. To meet this growing demand,  Deloitte has ordered 140 electric MINIs. According to BMW, this is the  largest order of fully electric MINIs in Europe so far. With an  additional charging infrastructure, Deloitte wants to make a  significant contribution to climate neutrality.Deloitte added the first 100 MINI Electric to its fleet back in  August last year. Now the company announces that it is adding 140 new  MINI Electric to its electric fleet. Deloitte's fleet now has 240 MINI  Electric. The fully electric MINIs with the eye-catching green  rear-view mirrors in Deloitte colour are particularly popular with new  employees. In total, Deloitte has ordered 540 new MINIs since June  this year.The growing popularity of electric cars at Deloitte goes hand in hand  with the increasing demand for hybrid vehicles at the company. As of  June 2021, electric and hybrid cars together account for 88% of all  company cars ordered at Deloitte. This clearly shows that employees  prefer sustainable alternatives to conventional cars with internal  combustion engines. In addition to purchasing electric cars, Deloitte  is investing heavily in its electric vehicle infrastructure. For  example, the Belgian office currently has 540 charging stations for  electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.""All our investments in sustainable mobility are part of  Deloitte's goal to be CO2 neutral by 2030. As our fleet accounts for  70% of our carbon footprint, every small and big step brings us closer  to carbon neutrality. That's why we launched a new mobility programme  in 2017. We have also been working successfully with MINI for many  years and I am delighted that we are working with them to increase  enthusiasm for electric cars at Deloitte. The fact that one in four  new employees now chooses an electric car gives me full confidence  that we are on the right track to make Deloitte a pioneer in  sustainable mobility,"" says Piet Vandendriessche, CEO of Deloitte Belgium. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.comThe BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the    BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles    and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility    services.

Century  Motorsport and its two drivers Gus Burton and Will Burns (both GBR)  wrapped up both the Driver and Team titles at the penultimate event of  the season at Oulton Park (GBR). Burton and Burns already had one hand on the trophy after race one on  Saturday in which they finished runner-up with the #57 BMW M4 GT4. In  race two on Sunday, the duo produced a drive worthy of champions to  win the title. With torrential rain causing perilous conditions,  Burton and Burns took their third victory of the season. That was  enough to give them an unassailable lead in the Drivers’ Championship  as well as in the Silver category. Century Motorsport was also crowned  champion in the Team competition with races to spare. “To be GT4 champions is just incredible. What a weekend,” said Burns.  Burton added: “Century have done such a superb job with the car. It  felt great, even in conditions like those. And the strategy has been  spot-on all season. I’m just delighted.” Their team-mates Andrew Gordon-Colebrooke and Chris Salkeld (both  GBR) failed to finish the opening race, before coming home ninth in  race two in the #9 BMW M4 GT4.

However, they then had to dig deep and show all their fighting  spirit. Yelloly was spun by another car at the start and fell back to  25th place. From there, he and Krohn made an impressive comeback. Over  the following 41 laps to the finish, they managed to climb into  seventh place in the #10 BMW M6 GT3. Yelloly and Krohn finished  eleventh in the Sunday race. --IMSA: Eventful races for Turner Motorsport at Laguna Seca.The Turner Motorsport team was in action in the North American IMSA  series at Laguna Seca (USA) at the weekend.

Their  team-mates Bill Auberlen and Dillion Machavern (both USA) led the race  in the #95 BMW M4 GT4 until 43 minutes from the end, but then dropped  back to 14th place as the result of a puncture. That was followed on Sunday by the race in the IMSA WeatherTech  SportsCar Championship. Starting from second on the grid, Auberlen and  Foley led the GTD class in the #96 BMW M6 GT3 for much of the race.  After two hours and 40 minutes, they crossed the finish line in fourth  place. Auberlen and Foley continue to lead the GTD Drivers’  Championship, while Turner Motorsport tops the standings in the GTD  Team competition. --Super GT Championship: Round five of the season for BMW Team    Studie in Sugo.Sugo (JPN) hosted the fifth event of this season’s Japanese Super GT  Championship at the weekend. In Saturday’s qualifying, Seiji Ara (JPN)  of BMW Team Studie set the fastest time in Group B in the #7 BMW M6  GT3. That put Ara and his team-mate Tomohide Yamaguchi (JPN) 15th in  the overall qualifying results. In an eventful race on Sunday, which  included several safety car periods, the duo in the #7 BMW M6 GT3  climbed through the field to finish eleventh. --TC France: One-two for the BMW M2 CS Racing at Lédenon.After a few weeks off for the summer, the 2021 season of the  “Championnat de France FFSA Tourisme” – TC France – resumed at Lédenon  (FRA). The BMW M Motorsport teams enjoyed more success at the fifth  event of the season. In Saturday’s opening race, they claimed a  one-two with the BMW M2 CS Racing. Ricardo van der Ende (NED / #16)  from the L’Espace Bienvenue team took victory, three seconds ahead of  second-placed Steven Palette (FRA / #18) from the VSF Sports team. In  race two on Sunday, Palette again finished runner-up to claim another  spot on the podium. In the TC Drivers’ Championship, Palette leads  with 183 points going into the finale.

Billy Horschel wins the BMW PGA Championship – European Ryder Cup Team line-up confirmed.;Spectators were able to return after one-year hiatus imposed by the Coronavirus pandemic, and fans enjoyed a top-quality BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth that boasted sporting drama galore. Horschel secured the title at the third Rolex Series event of the year, and his second major BMW title after the BMW Championship in Denver (USA) with an excellent final round of 65 (7 under par) and a birdie at the 18th hole. ; Spectators were able to return after one-year hiatus imposed    by the Coronavirus pandemic, and fans enjoyed a top-quality BMW PGA    Championship at Wentworth that boasted sporting drama galore.    Horschel secured the title at the third Rolex Series event of the    year, and his second major BMW title after the BMW Championship in    Denver (USA) with an excellent final round of 65 (7 under par) and a    birdie at the 18th hole. There was also plenty of suspense around    the question of who would claim the final three qualification spots    on the Ryder Cup Team Europe, and fans were kept guessing until late    in the final round.“On behalf of everyone at BMW, I would like to congratulate Billy  Horschel for winning the 2021 BMW PGA Championship,” said Chris  Brownridge, Chief Executive Officer BMW Group UK. “It has been  fantastic to see spectators safely back at Wentworth in person this  year and we have all been treated to an exciting tournament in return.”A thrilling final round at times featured 15 players in with a chance  of the title but it was Horschel who proved most adept at keeping his  nerve. In the end, seven birdies without a single dropped shot were  the key to the first victory for an American golfer at an event in the  prestigious Rolex series. The 2014 FedExCup champion only pulled clear  of the field on the final hole, taking a brilliant approach shot and  following that up with a tap-in birdie.“It feels amazing. We are talking about winning majors, the Players  Championship and a few other events, but after having been here in  2019, I added the BMW PGA Championship to that list,” said Horschel.  “In my opinion this is equal to winning a Players Championship. The  names on this trophy are legends in their own right. To be the second  American to win this event is amazing. There is something about me  playing well in BMW tournaments – I have to find some more BMW events  around the world.”Second place was shared by Kiradech Aphibarnrat (THA), Jamie  Donaldson (WAL) and Laurie Canter (ENG, all -18), ahead of Christiaan  Bezuidenhout (RSA, -17). Justin Rose, Andrew ‘Beef’ Johnston (both  ENG) and Francesco Laporta (ITA, all -16) followed tied in sixth.The BMW PGA Championship was the final tournament at which European  players had the chance to score points for the Ryder Cup. Four of the  nine qualification places were still mathematically up for grabs.  However, there was only a theoretical chance that England’s Matthew  Fitzpatrick and Tyrrell Hatton would miss out on qualification, so a  thrilling battle developed for the remaining three spots between Bernd  Wiesberger, Lee Westwood, and Shane Lowry. Wiesberger gave the most  solid performance over four rounds, becoming the first-ever Austrian  to qualify for the Ryder Cup. The advantage swung back and forth from  Westwood to Lowry, culminating in a heart-stopping finale on Sunday  that saw the Englishman claim the upper hand.Lowry’s dream of participating in the Ryder Cup for the first time  will still come true, however, as captain Padraig Harrington nominated  the Irish golfer as Captain’s Pick on Sunday at the Wentworth Club, as  was also the case for Ryder Cup legends Sergio García and Ian Poulter.  Jon Rahm (ESP), Rory McIlroy (NIR), Tommy Fleetwood (ENG), Viktor  Hovland (NOR) and Paul Casey (ENG) had already qualified for the  defending champions’ team before the BMW PGA Championship.The teams from the USA and Europe will face one another at Whistling  Straits (in the US state of Wisconsin) during the week after next  (21st to 26th September), which will also mark the debut of BMW as  Worldwide Partner of the Ryder Cup. The US team for the legendary and  emotionally charged team event will feature Collin Morikawa, Dustin  Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, Patrick  Cantlay, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Jordan Spieth, Harris English,  Daniel Berger and Scottie Scheffler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NLS 7: BMW Junior Team back on the podium with the BMW M6 GT3 – successful race debut for the new BMW M4 GT3.;The BMW Junior Team extends successful run at the Nürburgring Nordschleife in the NLS. After recording wins in races four and five, Max Hesse, Dan Harper and Neil Verhagen in the #44 BMW M6 GT3 remained involved in the battle for victory to the end of Saturday’s seventh race. After six hours of racing, they claimed the second spot on the podium. The new BMW M4 GT3 also made its debut at the seventh NLS race, driven by Philipp Eng and Augusto Farfus.;Nürburg. The BMW Junior Team extends successful run at the    Nürburgring Nordschleife (GER) in the Nürburgring Endurance Series    (NLS). After recording two wins in races four and five, Max Hesse    (GER), Dan Harper (GBR) and Neil Verhagen (USA) in the #44 BMW M6    GT3 remained involved in the battle for victory to the end of    Saturday’s seventh race. After six hours of racing, they claimed the    second spot on the podium. The new BMW M4 GT3 also made its debut at    the seventh NLS race, driven by Philipp Eng (AUT) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). The BMW Juniors secured fifth position on the grid in Saturday  morning’s qualifying session. A great, error-free performance from all  three drivers swiftly put the trio on course for the podium as they  battled for another win. They also set the fastest race lap with the  #44 BMW M6 GT3. Hesse, Harper and Verhagen finished second to secure  another podium, crossing the line less than 20 seconds behind the  victorious Manthey Porsche. The new BMW M4 GT3, which is still in the test and development phase,  made a racing debut out of competition in the SP-X prototype class.  Cars in this class have to start at the back of the GT3 field,  regardless of their result in qualifying. Farfus and Eng then worked  their way up into the top ten with the #55 BMW M4 GT3. Running the  tank to empty was part of the planning for the day, and the car then  rolled to a stop at the entry to the pit lane once the fuel ran out in  the final minutes. The #35 BMW M6 GT3 from Walkenhorst Motorsport also recorded a top  six finish. Jörg Müller, Mario von Bohlen, Dennis Fetzer (all GER) and  Thomas Neubauer (FRA) finished in sixth position. Starting from tenth  on the grid, David Pittard (GBR) sprinted up to second in the #34  Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M6 GT3, before a double dose of tyre damage  knocked him and his team-mates Christian Krognes (NOR) and Ben Tuck  (GBR) a long way back. The team’s #36 BMW M6 GT3, driven by Henry  Walkenhorst, Jörg Breuer and Andreas Ziegler (all GER), crossed the  line in 14th place overall, and in second place in the SP9 AM class. This was a first taste of the Nordschleife for Jake Dennis (GBR).  Having finished third in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship  2021, he had made his GT racing debut for BMW M Motorsport last  weekend in the Fanatec GT World Challenge Endurance Cup and is now  aiming for his Nordschleife permit. In the seventh NLS race, Dennis  shared driving duties with Niklas Krütten (GER) in the #652 BMW M240i  Racing from the Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive. The duo  claimed second place in the BMW M240i class. Reactions after round seven of the 2021 NLS. Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “We had a  successful day all round on the Nordschleife. Congratulations to our  three BMW Juniors Max, Dan and Neil – they battled for their next NLS  win right up to the final lap in their BMW M6 GT3 and can be very  satisfied with second place. The three gave an error-free performance,  delivering impressive proof that they are certainly one of the real  top teams on the Nordschleife. Our new BMW M4 GT3 also enjoyed a  successful race debut. The car ran like clockwork and we had no  problems at all during yesterday’s testing or in qualifying and the  race today. Augusto and Philipp were delighted with the performance of  the BMW M4 GT3 and confirmed how great the BMW M4 GT3 drives on the  Nordschleife. Overall, we are very pleased with this NLS Saturday.” Max Hesse, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “It was a  good six-hour race for us. The team gave a top performance and it was  very, very close at the end. Of course, it was a bit of a shame that  we didn’t quite manage to grab the win but we will try to do that  again in two weeks. To be honest, the Manthey guys are really strong  here at the Nordschleife. The drivers are the reigning champions in  the 24-hour race and so we can really pleased to have kept the gap to  below 20 seconds after a six-hour race.” Neil Verhagen, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “When  you are so close to the win, it is obviously a bit bitter-sweet but I  think we can be super happy with today. BMW Team RMG, Max and Dan and  myself, I think we all achieved pretty much the maximum that we could  today. We knew that we really need to put everything together to be  competitive and that is exactly what we did. So I am super happy with  the team and with my team-mates. Thank you to BMW and to everybody  involved to make this possible because it was definitely not easy. We  fought over the entire race and it was just down to the wire. Now we  keep pushing to return to the top step.” Dan Harper, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team:  “Overall, I am very happy with the result. Obviously on the  back of two wins, the second place and even being so close to first  place, can be a bit disappointing but we can for sure be very happy.  The team and us three drivers we have done a good job, we achieved the  maximum that was possible and collected good points for the  championship. And it is always nice to spray some champagne.” Philipp Eng, #55 BMW M4 GT3: “That was so much fun.  It was an honour for me to complete the debut race for the BMW M4 GT3  together with Augusto. The car drives extremely well. If you compare  it with the BMW M6 GT3, it is even easier to drive but the performance  is even better. The Nordschleife was a busy place again today and I  had a few situations with other cars but it helped that you can  overtake offline with the BMW M4 GT3 too, without getting yourself  into trouble right away. Overall, I feel that it went great. The race  was smooth and I would be happy to start the 24-hour race with this  car right away.” Augusto Farfus, #55 BMW M4 GT3: “It was a very  emotional day because I remember my first rollout in Dingolfing and  after so many months, we come to the Nordschleife and I did the first  race start with the new BMW M4 GT3. It was just great. Thanks to BMW  who did an amazing job, the car ran trouble-free. We could experience  and measure the speed of the car against the competition so it was a  great lesson today. The car feels very, very good and I can’t wait to  be back at the Nordschleife with the car.” Jake Dennis, #652 BMW M240i Racing: “It was fantastic  to finally experience the Nordschleife. It certainly lived up to my  expectations. Everybody had warned me how difficult it is and entire  circuit is just impressive. There is not really one combination what  makes it superior to any other, it is just 25 kilometres of challenge.  It is so on the edge and when the conditions are mixed as well, as we  had them in this morning’s qualifying, it makes life even more  challenging. But that’s part of the Nordschleife and that’s what makes  it so special. It has been a great experience and the BMW M240i Racing  is a great car to learn the circuit. And to finish second in the class  was obviously very nice.”  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Round three of the 2021 FIM EWC: BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team travels to the famous Bol d’Or with the wind in its sails.;The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is all set for the next classic in the 2021 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC). The 24-hour Bol d’Or on 18th/19th September at Circuit Paul Ricard in Le Castellet (FRA) is round three of the 2021 FIM EWC season.;Munich. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is all set for    the next classic in the 2021 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM    EWC). The 24-hour Bol d’Or on 18th/19th September at Circuit Paul    Ricard in Le Castellet (FRA) is round three of the 2021 FIM EWC    season. Alternating in the saddle of the #37 BMW M 1000 RR will once    again be Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Xavi    Forés (ESP). Kenny Foray (FRA) is also in Le Castellet as the team’s    fourth rider. In preparation for the famous endurance race, the BMW Motorrad World  Endurance Team attended a two-day test in Le Castellet last week. The  team, led by team principal Werner Daemen, and the four riders  fine-tuned the set-up of the #37 M RR, ready to take on the challenges  of the 24-hour race. The test was a successful one and the team set  the fastest time on both days – with a new lap record on each  occasion. On Tuesday, Mikhalchik topped the standings with a new  record of 1:53.261 minutes on the #37 bike. Reiterberger then went  even faster on the Wednesday, setting a new record of 1:52.484 minutes. The last time the Bol d’Or took place, in September 2019, the BMW  Motorrad World Endurance Team was making its debut in the FIM EWC.  Back then the team finished third with the #37 BMW S 1000 RR to claim  a spot on the podium at the first attempt. The team has also finished  third on the new #37 BMW M 1000 RR in each of the two races that have  been held so far in the 2021 season – the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA)  and the 12 Hours of Estoril (POR). The BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team lies third in the world championship with 80 points, seven less  than the leaders. The race weekend in Le Castellet kicks off on  Wednesday 15th September with scrutineering. This is followed on  Thursday 16th September by the first practice and qualifying sessions.  On Tuesday 14th September, another private test day will be held. As well as the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, the privateer BMW  teams Tecmas BMW 9 (#9 BMW S 1000 RR), Team univers racing/ACRacing  #23 (#23 BMW S 1000 RR) and LRP Poland (#90 BMW S 1000 RR) also  compete in the Bol d’Or. Quotes ahead of the Bol d’Or. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  Bol d’Or is one of the biggest classics in motorcycle racing. Our  debut in the FIM EWC in Le Castellet two years ago was unforgettable.  Finishing on the podium at the first attempt was very special. Since  then, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team has proven that this  success was no flash in the pan. It has established itself among the  world’s elite, first with the BMW S 1000 RR and now with the BMW M  1000 RR. Last week’s test was very promising and gives us momentum  ahead of the race weekend. However, we know that nothing is guaranteed  in an endurance race, and that is particularly true of 24-hour races.  Our goal is to impress with a strong performance at the Bol d’Or. The  ingredients are there to achieve that: a superbly coordinated and  experienced team, an extremely competitive motorbike, and strong, fast  and experienced riders. We are well equipped to face the challenges of  the Bol d’Or. If everything goes to plan in the race, we can continue  the success story of the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “The test last week was really good. We still had some small  issues, but this is normal. The team found a good set-up;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINI and the IAA Mobility 2021: #BIGLOVE – a feeling that lasts. ;Visions for sustainable mobility and cities designed for excellent quality of living, fresh stimuli for the MINI community and a clear commitment to diversity: with its ‘BIG LOVE from Munich’ campaign the British premium brand left its mark at the International Motor Show and not only with the large-format mural on the tower of “Sugar Mountain” designed by the artist Lakwena. ; Munich. #BIGLOVE is the MINI way of showing how two  small words can inspire positive action. Ever since the brand was born  in 1959, MINI has been all about doing more with less and finding the  most creative ways to use space. The current campaign being run by the  British premium brand goes one step further. #BIGLOVE is an expression  of diversity embraced in practice in all its forms, welcoming fresh  thinking and new ideas no matter where they come from. At the IAA  Mobility 2021 in Munich, the MINI brand presented its path towards  more sustainable mobility and an inclusive future for everyone based  on the claim “We’re all different, but pretty good together”.For the duration of the trade fair, under the motto “BIG LOVE from  Munich”, MINI contributed to the revitalisation of the vibrant  industrial site in the suburbs of Munich called “Sugar Mountain”,  which focuses on creativity, sport, personal fulfilment and community.  The site of the former concrete factory is now enhanced by a  multi-coloured mural on an old tower, designed by London-based artist  Lakwena Maciver especially for the occasion. Lakwena’s artistic style  thrives on bold statements and bright colours. Her aim is to make art  accessible to everyone. This is why she mainly paints in public  spaces, bringing art to people who might otherwise not have access to  it. This approach makes her the perfect partner for MINI, conveyed in  the messages that appear in her colourful mural with the words  “DIFFERENT BUT GOOD TOGETHER” and “BIG LOVE”. The installation will  continue to embellish the district of Obersendling in Munich after the  IAA Mobility 2021 is over.Sugar Mountain represented the kick-off of MINI’s IAA “Big love from  Munich” campaign with MINI friends taking part in a wide range of  activities here. Exciting matches on the World Club Tennis Court,  high-speed races on the BMX pump track and laid-back tricks on the Jam  Skate Park – they had plenty of space to spontaneously engage in  sports or express their own personal style. There was also the  opportunity to improve their DJ skills at a DJ set master class, with  the sound of relaxed beats providing the perfect background for people  to meet and relax in the spacious community area.Furthermore, adventurers and outdoor lovers alike experienced an  urban campsite with the AUTOHOME special edition roof tents for the  MINI Countryman. The roof tents, produced for the first time with  recycled materials, are made with bottles collected from the ocean and  fully match the brand’s design and the MINI pioneering spirit, where  every day offers new sustainable adventures and perspectives.MINI’s IAA BIG LOVE campaign continued in the MINI Pavillon at  Lenbachplatz in Munich where visitors were able to take part in a  variety of activities from culinary to sport. With displays created by  British fashion designer Paul Smith, the MINI Pavilion was also  transformed into a fascinating and versatile hotspot for fresh ideas.  The MINI STRIP, a custom-made one-off car by Paul Smith in  collaboration with MINI, presented here focused on the topics of  sustainability and innovation for increased environmental protection.  The MINI STRIP shines the spotlight on an innovative approach to the  issue of sustainability in automotive manufacturing. Guided by the  overarching theme of ‘Simplicity, Transparency, Sustainability’, the  car showcases inspirational ideas for a more sustainable method of  automotive design.Visitors also had the opportunity to find out about the future design  of individual mobility and urban living spaces through displays and  panel discussions involving designers and visionaries from the  creative tech start-ups that are being supported in connection with  the MINI Start-up Accelerator URBAN-X. The ideas presented were then  debated live with thought leaders from the dialogue platform “The  Sooner Now” under the motto “The city of tomorrow is made today”.This dialogue between visionaries and the MINI community during the  IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich was thus entirely dedicated to the crucial  issues of our time facing MINI: urban mobility, sustainability,  cosmopolitanism and individuality. In this way, the future-oriented  brand was able to leave behind positive stimuli and a feeling that  lasts – #BIGLOVE. In case of queries, please contact:Press and PRSarah Bauer, Press Officer Product Communication MINITelephone: +49-89-382-94180E-mail sarah.bauer@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW MotorradTelephone: +49-89-382-35108E-mail jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Contract signed with chassis partner: BMW M Motorsport enters the LMDh class with Dallara.;BMW M Motorsport has taken another important step towards entering the LMDh class in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series) from the 2023 season. The chassis for the two prototype cars will be produced in close collaboration with the globally-renowned and successful manufacturer Dallara. ;"Munich. BMW M Motorsport has taken another important step    towards entering the LMDh class in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar    Championship (IMSA series) from the 2023 season. The chassis for the    two prototype cars will be produced in close collaboration with the    globally-renowned and successful manufacturer Dallara. The contract    was signed on Wednesday at the Dallara headquarters in Varano de    Melegari (ITA).  “In Dallara, we are delighted to have found a partner for our LMDh  project that shares our passion, professionalism and huge ambition in  motorsport and, like us, is fully committed to the goal of writing a  new success story in the history of BMW M Motorsport from 2023,” said  Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH, during his trip to Italy. He took  the opportunity, along with Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport, and  Maurizio Leschiutta, head of the LMDh project, to check out the  outstanding development and test capabilities that Dallara has to  offer. “After speaking to all the possible chassis partners, the  decisive factor in our decision was that Dallara, with all its  expertise and experience, was enthusiastic about working together with  BMW M Motorsport. The chemistry was there between us from the word go.  We see our relationship as a real partnership in which we are fighting  for a common goal of success at the racetrack.” Flasch, Krack and Leschiutta met in Varano de Melegari for  discussions with the lead Dallara engineers and visited the key areas  of the company, including the composite department, its own wind  tunnel and the test track in Varano (ITA). The first test car will be  built in Italy in a close collaboration between BMW M Motorsport  engineers and a team of Dallara engineers assembled specifically for  the BMW LMDh project. The rollout will take place next year at the  Varano circuit. “Dallara is perhaps the most successful race car manufacturer in the  world and has already played a key role in virtually every relevant  circuit racing series,” said Leschiutta. “As well as the desire to  work with us, several other criteria were of great importance when  making our decision. Dallara is a company that covers the full range  of requirements. Its expertise extends to the fields of chassis  manufacturing, engineering, development, wind tunnel tests, and  simulations. They are very strong when it comes to aerodynamics, which  will be a key factor in the IMSA series. In order to ensure that our  cars are ideally prepared from the outset and to lay the foundations  for success at the racetrack, we are already working closely with  Dallara at a very early stage of development.” ""I'm honoured to have been selected by BMW M Motorsport and with  great enthusiasm I'm looking forward to begin this new adventure”,  said Giampaolo Dallara, President of Dallara. “Back in 1977 I had the  opportunity to work alongside BMW on designing the M1 as Lamborghini  consulting. It was a great experience and a lot was learned. I hope to  repeat the same adventure in LMDh. I firmly believe that we will do  great things together."" Andrea Pontremoli, CEO and General Manager of Dallara, added:  ""Our partnership with BMW M Motorsport is the result of almost 50  years of work in the motorsport industry, engineering and race car  development. It is a privilege to have been selected by BMW for their  next and new challenge in the hybrid prototype racing world. The LMDh  concept and the convergence between IMSA, ACO and FIA has no  precedence in history and that will see our total commitment. We are  looking forward to compete in this new and exciting chapter of the  global motorsport at its highest level."" Note to editors:                A new episode of the “MBEDDED” video series will be created on the  BMW Motorsport YouTube channel, focusing on the partnership with  Dallara. It includes exclusive insights from BMW M Motorsport from  behind the scenes of the LMDh project.

BMW Group is showing Automated Valet Parking for the first time at the IAA Mobility 2021.;Automated and driverless parking and service functions can be experienced by everyone in a unique demonstration. ;Munich. At the International Motor Show (IAA)  Mobility 2021, which will take place from September 7 to 12 in Munich,  the BMW Group will be showcasing in a variety of ways what premium  urban mobility could look like in the future. One example of this is  the Automated Valet Parking project, which was developed together with  the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) and other  partners. For the first time, interested parties will have the  opportunity to experience automated and driverless parking and service  functions up close in a unique demonstration. The focus of the impressive demonstration is the new technology  flagship of the BMW Group, the BMW iX. As an innovator in the  development fields of software, digital services and networking, the  fully electric SUV is able to communicate with the infrastructure  and  to carry out automated, driverless parking processes. Particular  attention is paid to the safety of the driving maneuvers and the data  exchange required for this between the vehicle, smartphone app and  parking garage infrastructure. In doing so, the BMW Group is  underlining that safety always has the highest priority. In addition  to the complete parking process, viewers experience other automated  service functions such as washing or charging the BMW iX with the help  of robots. The demonstrations will take place during the entire IAA Mobility  2021 from 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. in the parking garage West at Messe  München. A shuttle service connects the main entrance of Messe Ost  with the parking garage West. An IAA ticket is not required for the visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW M Motorsport News, 7th September 2021.;Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you an overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams.;DTM: Pole position and podium for Marco Wittmann in Spielberg.Walkenhorst Motorsport driver Marco Wittmann (GER) continued his  impressive run at the fifth race weekend of the DTM season. He has  picked up points in each of the ten races so far. Wittmann was the  best-placed BMW driver in the Saturday race at the Red Bull Ring  (AUT), finishing seventh. He started Sunday in sparkling form,  securing pole position in the #11 BMW M6 GT3. In the race, he was  embroiled in a compelling battle with Ferrari driver Liam Lawson  (NZL), behind whom he ultimately finished in second place. Following  his third podium of the season, Wittmann now lies fourth in the  Drivers’ Championship with 121 points, 26 points off the lead. Wittmann: “The start from pole was very good at first. We were  immediately able to open up a gap between Liam Lawson and the rest of  the field. We basically had good pace in the race too. In the end, we  lost first place in the pit stops, which is a big talking point this  season. Nevertheless, we scored more valuable points towards the  championship today.” Wittmann was referring to the fact that a number  of manufacturers have an advantage during the tyre change this season,  as the wheel nuts on their cars are fastened directly to the rims,  saving time. However, this type of attachment is not possible on some  of the cars, including the BMW M6 GT3. Timo Glock (GER) twice finished tenth to score points for ROWE Racing  in Spielberg. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) was very unlucky on both  days. After excellent qualifying results, with fourth on Saturday and  third on Sunday, he failed to finish both races. -- DTM Trophy: One-two-three for the BMW M4 GT4.The BMW M Motorsport teams celebrated a one-two-three in the DTM  Trophy at the Red Bull Ring (AUT) and claimed five of a possible six  podium places over the course of the two race days. Victory in  Saturday’s race went to Ben Green (GBR) in the FK Performance BMW M4  GT4, ahead of his team-mate Yann Zimmer (SUI) and Theo Oeverhaus (GER)  in a Walkenhorst Motorsport-run BMW M4 GT4. A total of six BMW drivers  made it into the top ten. On Sunday, five BMW M4 GT4 finished in the  points – two of them on the podium. That time, Michael Schrey (GER)  came home second in the Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport car. He was  followed over the finish line in third place by Green, whose second  podium of the weekend was sufficient to regain the lead in the  Drivers’ Championship. With 148 points, he now leads Sunday’s winner  William Tregurtha (USA, Mercedes) by ten points. Schrey is third with  110 points and still within striking distance. -- BMW M2 Cup: Double success for Oeverhaus.Theo Oeverhaus (GER) not only made it onto the podium in the DTM  Trophy at the Red Bull Ring (AUT), but also dominated both races in  the BMW M2 Cup. The 16-year-old secured pole position for both races  at the wheel of his BMW M2 CS Racing. After good starts in both races,  he went on to take commanding victories. In doing so, he was seemingly  unaffected by the turbulent racing going on behind him, which featured  some remarkable battles. “It was a dream weekend. Two wins, two poles  – just perfect,” said a delighted Oeverhaus. “I barely noticed all the  turmoil behind me. My re-starts after the safety car were really good.  I was immediately able to open a gap and stay clear of it all.” Second  and third place on Saturday went to Colin Caresani (NED) and Louis  Henkefend (GER). On Sunday, Henkefend finished runner-up behind  Oeverhaus and ahead of Nicolas Hancke (GER). In doing so, he extended  his overall lead. Now with 133 points to his name, he only has a  five-point lead over Fabian Kreim (GER), who finished fifth and fourth  in Spielberg. More information on the BMW M2 Cup can be found on the  official website bmwm2cup.com.  Images and video material can be downloaded here in the ‘Media’  section.   -- GTWC: 3-hour race at the Nürburgring.The scheduling clash with the DTM meant Walkenhorst Motorsport had to  field a different driver line-up in race four of this season’s Fanatec  GT World Challenge Endurance Cup at the Nürburgring (GER) at the  weekend. In the #34 BMW M6 GT3, regular driver David Pittard and his  new team-mates Jake Dennis and Nick Yelloly (all GBR) ended the  three-hour race in 12th place. Pittard had previously  finished runner-up in the Pro category in the Fanatec Esports GT Pro  Series on Saturday, scoring valuable points for Walkenhorst Motorsport  in the Team competition. Regular drivers Martin Tomczyk (GER) and  Thomas Neubauer (FRA) were joined by Nick Catsburg (NED) in the #35  BMW M6 GT3, and the trio finished the race in 15th place.  Boutsen Ginion Racing and its drivers Jens Klingmann (GER), Karim  Ojjeh (KSA) and Jens Liebhauser (GER) struggled with technical issues  in the race. They eventually came home 12th in the Pro-Am class. -- GT4 European Series: Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport on the Pro-Am podium.Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport made it onto the podium in the Pro-Am  class at the GT4 European Series event at the Nürburgring (GER).  Hansan Tansu and Yagiz Gedik (both TUR) finished second in their class  in the #11 BMW M4 GT4 on Saturday. Their team-mates Cem Bölükbasi and  Berkay Besler (both TUR) were seventh overall in the best-placed BMW  M4 GT4. Paolo Meloni (SMR) and Massimiliano Tresoldi (ITA) from the  W&D Racing Team finished fourth in the AM class, narrowly missing  out on a podium. The BMW M Motorsport teams did not produce any top  results in the Sunday race. -- Italian GT: BMW Team Italia on the podium with the BMW M6 GT3.Marius Zug (GER) and Stefano Comandini (ITA) impressed in both races  in the Italian GT Sprint Championship at Imola (ITA) and were rewarded  for their strong performances with a place on the podium. They came  home fourth on Saturday, narrowly missing out on a podium with the BMW  Team Italia BMW M6 GT3. However, they went one better on Sunday,  finishing third to secure their place on the podium. Their team-mates  Nicola Neri and Giuseppe Fascicolo (both ITA) were second in the  GT4-AM class in their BMW M4 GT4 on Saturday, but failed to finish the  Sunday race. -- BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Italy: Luigi Ferrara bags a brace at Imola.The fourth race weekend in the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Italy was all  about Luigi Ferrara (ITA). He won both races at Imola (ITA) and took a  big step towards the top of the overall standings. Now with 101 points  to his name, he trails the leader Gustavo Sandrucci (ITA) by just nine  points. Sandrucci finished runner-up behind Ferrara in the opening  race, but had to settle for sixth place in race two. Third place on  Saturday went to Lorenzo Marcucci (ITA), while Marco Zanasi and  Alessandro Brigatti (both ITA) joined Ferrara on the podium on Sunday. -- 24h Barcelona: ST Racing claims GT4 class victory.The ST Racing team celebrated victory in the GT4 class at the 24-hour  race in Barcelona (ESP). After 638 laps of racing, Samantha Tan, Nick  Wittmer (both CAN), Chandler Hull and Jon Miller (both USA) came home  well ahead of their closest rivals to take the class win and finish an  impressive 12th overall. Daren Jorgensen, Brett Strom (both  USA), Nathan Freke (GBR) and Danny van Dongen (NED) from the RHC  Jorgensen-Strom by Century team finished runner-up in the GT4 class to  complete a one-two for the BMW M4 GT4. -- GT World Challenge America: Victory for Turner Motorsport in    the BMW M6 GT3.Robby Foley and Michael Dinan (both USA) claimed the first win of the  season for Turner Motorsport in race two of the Fanatec GT World  Challenge America at Road America (USA). After 41 laps of racing, the  duo in the #96 BMW M6 GT3 came home 4.6 seconds ahead of their closest  rivals. Foley and Dinan had previously finished seventh overall,  fourth in the Pro category, in the first race of the event, which took  place on the last weekend in August. They now lie fourth in the  Drivers’ Championship with 87 points. -- GT4/GT/TC America: Victories and podiums aplenty for BMW teams.BMW M Motorsport teams claimed many victories and podiums across  various series and classes at the Road America (USA) race weekend at  the end of August. The BMW M4 GT4 was in action in both the GT4  America and GT America series at the iconic circuit. Meanwhile, the  BMW M2 CS Racing and the BMW M240i Racing were out on track in TC America. In GT4 America, the BMW M4 GT4 took five of the six places available  on the podium. In race one, it was James Walker and Bill Auberlen  (both USA) of the BimmerWorld Racing team who took victory, ahead of  Tom Capizzi and John Capresto-Dubets (both USA) of Auto Technic Racing  and the second BimmerWorld Racing duo of James Clay and Nick Galante  (both USA). Tim Barber and Cole Ciraulo (both USA) finished runner-up  in the Silver class for CCR Racing/Team TFB. The second race was won  by Sean Quinlan and Gregory Liefooghe (both USA) in the Stephen  Cameron Racing BMW M4 GT4, ahead of Capizzi and Capresto-Dubets, who  again finished runner-up. Harry Gottsacker and Tyler Maxson (both USA)  won the Silver class for ST Racing.

In race two, no fewer than six BMW M2 CS Racings led the field home.  The race was won by Stephen Cugliari (USA) of Accelerating  Performance, ahead of Hard Motorsport drivers Ruud and Steve Streimer  (USA). This was the same trio that had celebrated on the podium after  the opening race – only in a different order. Smith finished third in  the TC class this time. -- BTCC: A win and four podiums for BMW teams in Thruxton.The last weekend in August saw the British Touring Car Championship  (BTCC) at Thruxton (GBR) for the second time this season. There was  more cause for celebration for those at the wheel of the BMW 330i M  Sport – particularly Adam Morgan (GBR), who took victory for the Car  Gods with Ciceley Motorsport team in the third and final race on  Sunday. He was followed home in second place by Colin Turkington  (GBR). The Team BMW driver had finished 12th and sixth in the first  two races and is the top BMW driver in the Drivers’ Championship in  fifth place. Morgan is just below him in the standings in sixth place.  He ended the first two races at Thruxton in seventh and eighth place.  Tom Oliphant (GBR) made two appearances on the podium, finishing third  for Team BMW in races one and two. He rounded the weekend off with  12th place in the third race.

The BMW Group emphasizes its consistent focus on sustainability at the 2021 IAA Mobility: More stringent CO2 targets go hand in hand with concrete measures and concepts for implementation;The BMW Group is putting circular economy and sustainable urban mobility at the centre of its presence at the 2021 IAA Mobility. At the motor show, the company is consistently demonstrating its sustainability and CO2 targets as well as its concrete measures and concepts to achieve these goals.; Munich. The BMW Group is putting circular economy and  sustainable urban mobility at the centre of its presence at the 2021  IAA Mobility. At the motor show, the company is consistently  demonstrating its sustainability and CO2 targets as well as its  concrete measures and concepts to achieve these goals. More stringent CO2 targets and consistent focus on a circular economyThe BMW Group is increasing the pace of its efforts to combat climate  change. Looking ahead to the introduction of the Neue Klasse, the  company is further strengthening its self-defined objectives,  announced in summer last year, to significantly reduce CO2 emissions,  whilst also committing itself to a clear course that supports the 1.5  degree target for the limitation of global warming. The Neue Klasse  will also see the BMW Group hugely increase its use of secondary  materials with a firm focus on the principles of the circular economy,  whilst also promoting better framework conditions for establishing a  market for secondary materials. To achieve a further reduction in CO2 emissions, the focus is on the  utilisation phase of vehicles, which account for 70% of the BMW  Group’s CO2 footprint. By 2030, the CO2 emissions per vehicle and  kilometre driven will be at least halved from 2019 levels. The  commitment of all manufacturers when it comes to combatting climate  change can best be compared when looking at the entire life cycle of a  vehicle, including production and upstream supply chain. Here, the BMW  Group is planning a reduction of CO2 emission per vehicle of at least 40%. “How companies are dealing with CO2 emissions has become a major  factor when it comes to judging corporate action. The decisive factor  in the fight against global warming is how strongly we can improve the  carbon footprint of vehicles over their entire life span. This is why  we are setting ourselves transparent and ambitious goals for the  substantial reduction of CO2 emissions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The BMW i Vision AMBY.;Munich. With the BMW i Vision AMBY, the first high-speed pedelec for urbanists,  the BMW Group is presenting a visionary two-wheeled solution for the urban  mobility of tomorrow.;Munich. With the BMW i Vision AMBY, the first  high-speed pedelec for urbanists, the BMW Group is presenting a  visionary two-wheeled solution for the urban mobility of tomorrow.  From the outside, the BMW i Vision AMBY looks similar to an e-bike,  but it offers significantly more possibilities. It is one of five  different concept vehicles with which the BMW Group is presenting its  vision of individual mobility in cities and their surrounding areas at  the IAA Mobility event. Under a single umbrella spanning electric  mobility, digitality and sustainability, the five pioneering concepts  create a versatile mobility mix on two and four wheels fuelled by  sustainable thinking which comprehensively addresses an extremely wide  range of mobility needs.The BMW i Vision AMBY and BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY.  AMBY is a neologism for “adaptive mobility”. The BMW i  Vision AMBY and BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY Vision Vehicles (see also the  separate press release on the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY) interpret the  basic idea of adaptive urban mobility on two wheels in different ways.  The two vehicles are both fitted with an electric drive system with  three speed ratings for different types of roads. The drive system  enables speeds of up to 25 km/h (15.5 mph) on cycle tracks, up to 45  km/h (28 mph) on city-centre roads and up to 60 km/h (37 mph) on  multi-lane roads and outside urban areas. However, insurance plates  and a corresponding licence are required for the higher speeds. While  users of the BMW i Vision AMBY high-speed pedelec have to constantly  pedal in order to benefit from the assistance of the electric drive  system, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY accelerates via a throttle  grip/throttle lever and has motorcycle-style footrests instead of pedals.The modes available to the rider are stored in the app on the  smartphone linked with the “AMBY” Vision Vehicle. Manual selection of  the modes is perfectly feasible, as are automatic recognition of  location and road type via geofencing technology and the associated  automatic adjustment of top speed. In the absence of any existing  legal framework for a vehicle of this kind with a modular speed  concept, the “AMBY” Vision Vehicles set out to prompt the introduction  of such legislation and by consequence developments of this nature.  The BMW Group is therefore showing its keenness to remain part of the  mobility conversation in cities, even if in the years ahead those  cities offer motor cars an increasingly small space in which to function.Defying categorisation.“Everywhere you look,  apparently established categories are being blown apart – and that’s a  good thing. In the future, classifications such as ‘car’, ‘bicycle’  and ‘motorcycle’ should not determine the nature of the products we  think up, develop and offer,” explains Werner Haumayr, Vice President  BMW Group Design Conception. “Rather, this paradigm shift gives us the  opportunity to tailor products to people’s lifestyles – as we can see  with the BMW i Vision AMBY high-speed pedelec. This vehicle occupies  the space between a bicycle and a light motorcycle and allows our  customers to decide for themselves which roads or routes they want to  travel on through an urban area. They have all the flexibility  possible, at the same time as turning the pedals and keeping  themselves fit. The modes and clever route selection are intended to  make it one of the fastest travel options through a city.”The BMW Group views the BMW i Vision AMBY as an attractive means of  transport for the future in larger cities. As a second vehicle for a  family or an entry point into the world of pedal-driven, electrified  two-wheeled vehicles, the BMW i Vision AMBY offers an extremely varied  range of applications. It hugely expands the usage scope of a  conventional e-bike through clever technologies related to the three  riding modes.The design: more than an e-bike.The design of  the BMW i Vision AMBY is defined by visual lightness and powerful  athleticism. And every detail promises that it is capable of more than  a regular e-bike. The frame structure is larger and the impression is  one of greater strength and stability in every respect. The modern  frame geometry feels like a mixture of racing bike and sporty e-bike.  The upper frame tube, crafted from four sculptural aluminium profiles,  represents an expressive and modern statement of intent – and not only  in visual terms. A slightly rising sweep to its design underscores the  dynamic intent. The space between the profiles also offers stowage  room for a backpack or laptop bag. Located just before the handlebars  is the smartphone integration pad, which holds the device safely in  place using magnets and ensures it is highly visible.The battery is positioned in the centre of the frame. Its 2,000 Wh  enables a range of up to 300 km (186 miles), depending on the riding  mode. Thanks to fast charging technology, it recharges in only three  hours. The drive unit, which is positioned close to the pedals and is  also black in colour, only provides assistance when the pedals are  being turned. Power transfer is by low-maintenance toothed belt, and  the transmission is integrated into the drive system. A sophisticated  single-sided swinging arm otherwise unique to BMW Motorrad links the  rear wheel with the frame. 120 mm of suspension travel front and rear  is ideal for all applications in and around town at speeds of up to 60  km/h (37 mph). The 27.5-inch wheels are fitted with larger and wider  tyres than normal in order to ensure exceptional comfort and safety  even at higher speeds.Impressively integrated details and ease of  transportation.The design of the handlebar stem as part  of the frame has a very technical and high-quality feel. A slim,  horizontal LED light strip is integrated into the wide handlebars and  underscores the cutting-edge, technical look of this frame section.  Likewise fully integrated brakes and internally routed cables set the  seal on the aura of technical modernity covering the handlebar area.  The vertical LED rear light is integrated into the seat post. Below  it, an e-ink display shows the riding mode in use.The rear wheel with central fastening can be released and removed  easily for optimum ease of transportation. The wheel in the front  suspension fork can likewise be removed in the classical way with a  screw. The result is a compact construction, and the battery can also  be removed and stored separately, which reduces load weight.Focus on sustainability.A pedal-driven  two-wheeled vehicle brings many benefits to urban conurbations as a  means of transport – in terms of zero emissions functionality, traffic  area development and energy efficiency – through its underlying  concept alone. The BMW i Vision AMBY two-wheeler also forms part of  the circular economy messaging for the BMW i Vision Circular, which is  likewise celebrating its premiere at the IAA 2021 Mobility. The frame  can be clearly recognised as being made from the same anodised  secondary aluminium as the main body of the BMW i Vision Circular.  Added to which, parts of the handlebars and battery cover are  manufactured from “floating grey polymers”, a recycled plastic also  employed in the bumpers of the Vision Vehicle. These materials can be  fed back into the BMW Group materials cycle more easily once the  product has reached the end of its life. An oil derived from rapeseed  is used as brake fluid. And the BMW Group was also careful to ensure  the components of the BMW i Vision AMBY were produced locally in  Germany and – with the supply chain in mind – transportation distances  for them were kept to a minimum.More details on the sustainability-related themes around the BMW  Group’s concept vehicles at IAA Mobility 2021 can be found on the BMW  Circular Lab microsite at bmw.com, in the BMW Circular Hub at  Max-Joseph-Platz in central Munich and in connection with the BMW i  Vision Circular Vision Vehicle.Smartphones act as a key.Users can prime the  BMW i Vision AMBY for use, load their stored licence classes and apply  the required level of insurance cover on demand using a specially  developed app. The app therefore takes on the role traditionally  performed by a vehicle key. It uses familiar smartphone identification  functionality (e.g. facial recognition) in the same way as the Digital  Key, which was introduced by the BMW Group in an automotive industry  first and turns a compatible iPhone into a digital car key by allowing  customers to unlock, lock and, of course, start their BMW safely and  easily. Other basic functions and status requests (e.g. the current  and scheduled charge level) are also available, as when using the BMW  app. The electrically adjustable seat post is optimised biometrically  to match the profile stored in the app, with the settings adjusted  according to pre-entered data – such as the height and inside leg  measurement of the user – before setting off. Over-the-air updates  allow customers to download software updates and adjustments at any  time. The smartphone shown on the Vision Vehicle charges inductively  on the magnetic bracket low down in the rider’s field of view. These  connectivity options also bring theft-proofing and the free  programmable immobiliser as a basic function. And the search function  “Where is my BMW i Vision AMBY” is just a click on a smartphone away.Geofencing technology plays a central  role.Instead of the user choosing the riding mode  themselves, geofencing technology – in combination with the detailed  HERE map service – is able to create the relevant parameters for  automatically setting the speed mode (25/ 45/ 60 km/h [15.5/ 28/ 37  mph]) and corresponding insurance cover. This geofencing technology  enables the vehicle to recognise the type of road being used and  automatically adjusts the maximum permitted speed accordingly. This  means the BMW i Vision AMBY can turn from a pedelec into an  S-pedelec-type vehicle or even one similar to a motorcycle. Manual  mode control is, of course, also provided in order to give the user  maximum freedom when it comes to using the various types of route.  However, intelligent technology ensures the relevant traffic and  safety rules are still kept to at all times. The mode engaged is shown  on the display using e-ink technology – this makes it easy for other  road users to identify the mode activated/selected.Other technological functions that could be included in the BMW i  Vision AMBY are an ABS system optimised for bicycles, an automatic  high-beam assistant and brake light assistant, and a daytime riding  light – all of which could increase safety. A tyre pressure monitoring  system similar to that fitted to BMW Group motorcycles is also a  possibility. Meanwhile, a proximity radar operating over a range of up  to 140 m gives the user a visual and acoustic warning (via the app) of  vehicles approaching from the rear, and rounds off the range of  possible safety features.Performance data for the BMW i Vision AMBY300+ km / 186+ miles          (up to 25 km/h / 15.5 mph Vmax)180 km / 112 miles (up to 45 km/h / 28 mph Vmax)75 km / 47 miles (up to 60 km/h / 37 mph Vmax) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The BMW i Vision Circular.;Munich. With the BMW i Vision Circular, the BMW Group is looking ahead to a compact BMW for the year 2040 that is focused squarely on sustainability and luxury. ;Munich. With the BMW i Vision Circular, the BMW Group  is looking ahead to a compact BMW for the year 2040 that is focused  squarely on sustainability and luxury. The four-seater is fully  electrically powered and offers a generous amount of interior space  within its around four-metre-long footprint. It has furthermore been  designed according to circular economy principles across the board and  therefore symbolises the BMW Group’s ambitious plan to become the  world’s most sustainable manufacturer in the individual premium  mobility space.The Vision Vehicle is one of five different concept vehicles with  which the BMW Group is presenting how it envisages individual urban  mobility at the IAA Mobility 2021 event. Under a single umbrella  spanning electric mobility, digitalisation and sustainability, the  five pioneering concepts create a versatile mobility mix on two and  four wheels fuelled by sustainable thinking, which comprehensively  addresses an extremely wide range of mobility needs in the face of  fast-changing requirements and growing challenges.Circular economy and secondary materials cut CO2  emissions.The BMW Group’s overriding aim as it strives  to achieve climate neutrality is to reduce CO2 emissions throughout a  vehicle’s entire life cycle. Besides electrifying the product  portfolio and switching to renewable energy for manufacturing, the  company is focusing particularly on circular economy principles and  the use of secondary materials. These materials, such as secondary  aluminium and secondary steel, can be obtained by recycling waste  material and then reused. The process for supplying secondary  materials is far less harmful to the environment and carbon intensive  compared to the extraction and manufacture of primary material. This  can bring about a major improvement in a vehicle’s carbon footprint,  especially on the supply chain side. At present, vehicles from the BMW  Group are manufactured using nearly 30 per cent recycled and reused  material on average. The ‘secondary first’ approach is intended to  gradually increase this figure to 50 per cent.“The BMW i Vision Circular illustrates our all-encompassing,  meticulous way of thinking when it comes to sustainable mobility. It  symbolises our ambition to be a pioneering force in the development of  a circular economy,” explains Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of  Management of BMW AG. “We lead the way for resource efficiency in  production and we are seeking to extend this status to all stages of  the vehicle life cycle. This is a question of economic sustainability  too, as the current trend in commodity prices clearly shows the  financial consequences in store for any industry that is reliant on  finite resources.” He adds, “We will take the next big step towards  achieving this with the ‘Neue Klasse’ models. We appreciate there are  many BMW fans longing for a first foretaste of the ‘Neue Klasse’, but  the BMW i Vision Circular isn’t it. I can promise, however, that, on a  sustainability level, the ‘Neue Klasse’ is being developed with the  same mindset applied for the BMW i Vision Circular.”The overriding design aim for the BMW i Vision Circular was to create  a vehicle that is optimised for closed materials cycles and achieves  100% use of recycled materials / 100% recyclability. This involves  making particular use of materials that have already completed a  product life cycle – or secondary materials as they are known –  alongside certified bio-based raw materials. The same applies to the  energy storage device: the all-solid-state battery in the BMW i Vision  Circular is 100 per cent recyclable and manufactured almost entirely  using materials sourced from the recycling loop. It will achieve much  higher energy density with significantly reduced use of the most  valuable resources.Circular design – a new approach.“We gave thorough consideration to circularity from the outset  during the design process for the BMW i Vision Circular. As a result,  this Vision Vehicle is packed with innovative ideas for combining  sustainability with a new, inspirational aesthetic – we call this  approach ‘circular design’,” explains Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW  Group Design. Circular design embraces the four principles of  RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE and RE:CYCLE.RE:THINK. Circular product design begins by thinking  about things differently. For the BMW i Vision Circular this meant  scrutinising processes and manufacturing technologies and thinking  differently. The function performed by each component part up to now  was examined, after which the part was removed without replacement or  cleverly repackaged where appropriate and then designed to enable  closed materials cycles.RE:DUCE. “I do more with less” has long been an  integral part of the BMW i philosophy. The BMW i Vision Circular  demonstrates this through the rigorously applied reduction in the  number of component parts, material groups and surface finishes,  dispensing completely with exterior paintwork, leather and chrome, for  instance. Materials from bio-based raw materials also help to minimise  environmental impact and contribute to a smaller carbon footprint. As  far as the digitalisation features are concerned, smart control panels  reduce both complexity and the use of materials. In addition to this,  digital surface treatments enable a reduction in the number of  hardware variants at the same time as opening up whole new  possibilities for design.RE:USE. Ideally, a sustainable product will have a  long lifespan, with a rich and enjoyable product experience making  people a lot more enthusiastic about using the product – and using it  for longer. One way of ensuring this happens is by incorporating  digitality to create new experiences. The display options via digital  display surfaces in the exterior and interior of a car and the  availability of “option as a service” allow users to constantly bring  something new to the vehicle. Constant updates over the air and cloud  computing keep the product technically up to date for longer. And the  vehicle’s life cycle can also be extended by refurbishing and  re-design. Easily detachable connections make it far simpler for users  to replace individual materials and component parts, allowing them to  keep restyling the vehicle.RE:CYCLE. When it comes to the materials used, the  focus with the BMW i Vision Circular is on recycled materials  (“secondary first” approach) which are intended to be reused again at  the end of the product life cycle. Having a small number of different  mono-material groups with connections that can easily be undone is  crucial for good recycling. For this reason, the BMW i Vision Circular  avoids bonded connections or composite materials and uses intelligent  types of connection, such as cords, press studs and quick-release  fasteners, instead. It showcases a purpose-developed, aesthetically  appealing quick-release fastener for the wheels, seats and instrument  panel that creates a ‘joyful fusion’. The laser-etched graphic in the  centre of the quick-release fastener is made up of the letters of the  word “circular” arranged in the form of a circle. A special socket  wrench separates the component parts joined by the fastener with a  single rotation. The ‘joyful fusion’ fastener creates a theft-proof  and stable connection and, at the same time, allows many component  parts of the vehicle to be dismantled with just a single tool.“BMW has always known how to resolve apparent contradictions in its  products,” explains Domagoj Dukec, Head of BMW Design. “With the BMW i  Vision Circular, we have set ourselves the challenge of designing a  100% circular vehicle, while at the same time meeting – and in some  respects exceeding – our customers’ self-evident expectations when it  comes to lifestyle and luxury.”Re-interpreting classical icons – the front  end.The puristic front end clearly conveys the  aesthetic power of circular design. In keeping with the principles of  “RE:THINK” and “RE:USE”, the number of parts here has been reduced to  the max. Instead of having a chrome surround with bars, the kidney  grille has been newly interpreted as a digital surface. The kidney  surfaces extend across the entire width of the front end, merging the  headlights and grille into an unmistakable “double-icon” that will  continue to be a clear BMW identifier. At the same time, the kidney  surfaces are turned into a graphic interface. In the future, digital  design could make geometric variations in lights and bumpers  redundant, helping to reduce the quantity of materials and tools required.A discreet line graphic on the kidney surfaces constitutes the sole  decorative element in the front end. Using a process of intelligent  surface refinement, it brings a new and artistic twist to the familiar  parallel kidney bar look. This line graphic forms a recurring theme  that is also found in the windows, the rear end, the roof, wheels and  floor coverings. The BMW i Vision Circular has no other additive trim  elements or badging of the sort currently used to signify quality. The  brand logo on the front end is engraved and the vehicle badge is  laser-etched to avoid using extra add-on parts.The surfaces below the windscreen are made from secondary aluminium.  An additional sensor cluster between the two kidney elements groups  together technological features, enabling simple disassembly within a  single removable element. The bumper area further down is manufactured  from recycled plastic with a sophisticated marbled surface.A new silhouette for BMW – the side view.The  circular design approach exudes puristic clarity when viewing the car  in profile too. The BMW i Vision Circular has a clear mono-volume  design made up of just a small number of parts, with the array of  different materials used reduced to a minimum. The design language  here is clear and accessible. The proportions, meanwhile, take BMW in  a new direction. The vehicle extends in an unbroken volume from the  front to rear axle, offering a generous breadth of interior usability  within a small footprint. Even at a standstill, the rising roofline  and a cowl panel pushed well forward give the compact silhouette the  appearance of surging dynamically down the road. The wheels form  almost the outer limits of the vehicle, combining with the prominently  flared wheel arches to produce a hunkered-down, sporty stance.  Together with its electrified architecture, the Vision Vehicle offers  a luxury-class interior on a small car footprint.The large-surfaced, flush-glazed passenger compartment lends a sense  of modernity and lightness to the flanks. Instead of using a chrome  trim strip as a surround for the window graphic, there is a slim  digital surface extending like a ribbon around the Hofmeister kink.  This is not only a stylistic element, but also a display and  control/operation surface. It can be used to show information about  the vehicle status and guide users to the door opener using light as  they approach the car. When the door opener is touched, the two portal  doors open in opposite directions, making it easy for the driver and  passengers to climb aboard and opening up the generously sized interior.Refined surfaces rather than paintwork.The BMW i Vision Circular deliberately avoids the use of paint  for the exterior, and instead features a main body made from secondary  aluminium with a light-gold anodised finish. The calmer feel of this  Anodized Mystic Bronze shade contrasts with the more “animated” and  richly coloured surface at the rear made from heat-treated steel. The  heat treatment process creates the colour Temper Blue Steel, an  alluring interplay of bluish purple surfaces whose cloud-like aspect  would lend a highly individual touch to any vehicle. The refinement  processes employed for the individual surfaces give them significant  visual impact, while preserving the raw materiality of the two metals  for optimal reusability. This shows how it will be possible to refine  surfaces using innovative processes in future without the need for  paint finishes.Innovative details in the wheel area.The tyres  in “Vivid Blue Rubber” are made from certified, sustainably cultivated  natural rubber and have a slightly transparent appearance. Extra  coloured, recycled rubber particles are added to the tyre compound for  strengthening, creating an intriguing terrazzo effect and purposefully  highlighting the reuse of materials. The wheel rims are designed and  manufactured with minimal materials use. Rim centres with maximum  permeability provide brake cooling, while the more enclosed surfaces  to the outer reaches of the wheels ensure the greatest possible  aerodynamic efficiency. The wheels are fixed in place using the  “joyful fusion” quick-release fastener that adorns the centre of the  wheel, forming a sophisticated visual highlight. Only visible when  looking from above, a narrow fin is integrated centrally in the rear  section of the glass roof. It contains the communications and antenna  technology, and provides information on the status of the vehicle  (open/closed, charge level of the battery, etc.). It also integrates  the high-mounted centre brake light.Monolithic and modern – the rear end.The rear  end also has a puristic, clear appearance. All the display surfaces  and light functions are integrated invisibly into the dark glass  tailgate, replicating the approach taken at the front end. When the  car is switched off, only the two-dimensional BMW logo in the dark  glass surface is visible. Switching the car on activates both the  functional light elements and the line graphic at the front end. Below  the tailgate, a clearly sculpted surface made from secondary steel  creates a striking horizontal movement. A slight uptick here injects  the rear end with dynamic flair and provides a high-class border.  Moving further down, the perfectly minimalised and aerodynamically  optimised black bumper – likewise made from visibly recycled plastic –  rounds off the rear-end design at its point lowest to the road.Visibly sustainable luxury - the interior  design.Inside, the BMW i Vision Circular seeks to  create a luxurious ambience, employing materials and production  processes that are indicative of a responsible approach to the  environment and its resources. The interior of the BMW i Vision  Circular thereby highlights what will be possible in the future when  it comes to circularity and purposeful selection of materials – and  the kind of intriguing aesthetics that might emerge as a result. This  involves using not just the right basic materials in the form of  mono-materials but also clever new joining techniques for them which  avoid the use of glue in order to ensure optimum suitability for  dismantling and sorting at a later stage. In order to minimise the  amount of waste and offcuts, all components and materials will be  manufactured to fit exactly using processes such as 3D printing. Any  surplus material will be systematically fed back into the materials cycle.The interior – modern, light and supremely sustainable.  The two outer-hinged portal doors swing wide open to  reveal a light and airy interior. The basic colour scheme for the  cabin is composed of taupe with elements of grey and the light mint  green shade (“MONOchrome Mint”) used for the floor and side trim  panels. This coordinates perfectly with the taupe/violet “MONOchrome  Taupe” finish for the front and rear seats to create a modern and  homely atmosphere. Gold-bronze metal accents in the same Anodized  Mystic Bronze shade used for the exterior add a warm and sophisticated contrast.The interior greets the driver and front passenger with a high degree  of transparency and an open sense of space. The glass roof with  pronounced rearward placement of the windscreen header gives those in  the front the impression they are sitting in the open air while also  maximising the feeling of spaciousness experienced within a small  footprint. The four seats have been intentionally designed to look  more look like pieces of furniture. In the front, two separate lounge  seats with integral head restraints create an exclusive ambience.  Their velvet-like upholstery is made from recycled plastic and is held  within a light-gold aluminium frame. The seats rest on a slender  mono-post base with fore/aft adjustment. Together with the  accompanying omission of a centre console, this design has the effect  of creating vast amounts of legroom for passengers in the second row.  The back of the slim front seat shells is made of recycled plastics  with a terrazzo-look finish. Another circular ‘joyful fusion’  quick-release fastener for simple dismantling can be found here,  allowing the metal and fabric to be easily separated and sorted, and  then reused.Re-interpreted instrument panel. The global  user experience in the BMW i Vision Circular, like its material  qualities, deliberately showcases a more distant future with greater  in-car intelligence and more sensors that react to the user. Reducing  the number of components while also grouping functions together  creates a ‘phygital experience’. This newly coined term refers to  turning digitality into a haptic experience. Depending on the use  case, this involves either implementing the underlying technology in a  highly integrated, virtually invisible manner as an extension of the  ‘shy tech’ approach or – as demonstrated by the instrument panel –  deliberately showcasing it and bringing it to life as an artistic icon.The classical instrument panel is turned into a next-generation  phygital user interface. Here, it takes the form of a hovering,  V-shaped sculpture that projects out into the cabin. At its heart is a  3D-printed, crystal body with nerve-like structures running through  it, great visual depth and an enthralling lighting effect. This is  where the vehicle’s “thinking” is visualised, allowing the user to see  its intelligence at work. The instrument panel also serves as an area  for interaction though, giving form to the fundamental idea of  creating experiences that extend far beyond displays and buttons. The  crystal body is bordered on both sides by naturally treated wood that  has been responsibly sourced and externally certified, as is the case  with all bio-based raw materials. Gold-bronze elements made from  anodised secondary aluminium connect the instrument panel to the  A-pillars. The metallic side sections once again feature the ‘joyful  fusion’ quick-release fasteners for straightforward dismantling.Displays reimagined. The information area you  would normally expect to find in a central information display is  located above the instrument panel at the bottom of the windscreen.  This display area takes the Head-Up Display as first brought out by  BMW to a whole new level. All relevant information is projected onto  the bottom area of the windscreen across its entire width. Driving  displays for the driver can be found here together with communications  functions and entertainment features for the passengers. Information  can be moved directly into the user’s field of vision or hidden, as  desired. Intelligent use of technologies therefore transforms the  existing windscreen into an information source, eliminating the need  for any other displays in the interior at the same time, and is  another example application of shy tech at work. The projected content  is controlled by means of interaction pads in the steering wheel,  while passengers can easily connect their mobile devices to the  vehicle and then call up individual content in the windscreen’s front  passenger section or activate the personal speakers for a seamless  infotainment offering. From the outside, a graduated black printed  surface with a gold-bronze pattern gives added effect to the display  area of the windscreen.3D-printed steering wheel.The steering wheel  forms a link between past and future at the same time as reducing the  quantity of material and components. The rim has been 3D-printed from  bio-based material, with the wood powder variant shown here giving the  steering wheel a natural and warm feel. The unconventional, central  positioning of the vertical spoke in gold-bronze adds a modern twist.  It incorporates another crystal interface area featuring backlighting  and displays similar to those of the instrument panel. To the left and  right of the steering wheel’s centre, in the vicinity of the driver’s  thumbs, are pads that are activated by the thumbs moving towards or  touching them and operated by thumb movements (similar to today’s  multifunction steering wheels). These pads are phygital touchpoints  that reinforce the principle of “hands on the wheel, eyes on the road”  and control the content shown in the windscreen’s information area.Display surface connects the exterior with the  interiorThe display and operating surface below the  windows visible on the outside of the car can be found on the inside  too, forming a connecting element between interior and exterior. Here  again, it extends back into the rear of the car and around the  Hofmeister kink. Featuring the same crystal appearance as the  instrument panel and ambient lighting, this element in the sidewall  adds to the intriguing and mystical aura produced in the cabin. It  additionally incorporates a number of functions, including the power  window switches, door openers and the controls for the sunshade in the  roof. This means it forms the only electronic component in the doors,  and it can be simply removed as a module when dismantling the vehicle  and then separated and sorted.Inviting rear compartment.The pronounced  rearward placement of the windscreen header provides passengers in the  rear with a separate glass roof featuring a mechanical shading  function. This function comprises two glass panels with a pattern of  parallel lines that can be pushed together to vary the degree of  shading between 50% and 100%. The use of two panels for the shading  function results in a very slim design that does not add to the  height. Here, intelligent graphic design has led to an innovation  which does not require any additional technology or electronics yet  still achieves the maximum effect.In addition to this, the rear of the cabin has been shaped into a  large, slightly raised bench seat, which offers an inviting space for  two with its amply proportioned, softly padded side bolsters. The head  restraints look like cushions placed on a supporting structure,  further emphasising the soft, cosy character. The audio speakers are  located beneath the head restraint cushions. Each seat has its own  dedicated sound zone, meaning that individual audio content can be  enjoyed anywhere in the vehicle without acoustic interference. Direct  sound control reduces the number of parts required and simplifies  removal of the system. This is just one example of the possible ways  in which modern technical features can be subtly integrated into an  interior setting that has the appearance of a comfortable apartment.Sophisticated details in the rear.The fabric  upholstery for the seats in MONOchrome Taupe is made entirely from  recycled material, but has been woven here into an elaborate Jacquard  design. The lavish upholstery is further enhanced by precise quilting  and is held in place by press studs for easier dismantling, as on the  front seats. The rear bench seat is bordered by an anodised aluminium  frame in gold-bronze. The method for joining the seat upholstery to  the frame is another noteworthy detail here, as the fabric is  interwoven with the frame by means of a cord. The connection can be  undone again manually when it is time to dismantle the seat. The  deep-pile carpet in MONOchrome Mint creates a pleasant atmosphere  throughout the vehicle. It has the characteristic pattern of lines  familiar from the exterior printed into it and is manufactured from  100 per cent recycled plastic. In the C-pillar, a glass iDrive  Controller from a BMW iX enjoys a second life with a new function as a  lamp – a very smart touch that illustrates the principle of “RE:USE”.The sound design of the BMW i Vision  Circular.The composer Hans Zimmer and Renzo Vitale,  Creative Director Sound BMW Group, came up with an exclusive sound  design for the BMW i Vision Circular that makes its circularity  audible. “The idea was to combine different samples to keep injecting  new life into the sounds inside the vehicle, in the same way its  materials get a new lease of life,” explains Hans Zimmer. “The concept  of objects potentially having an almost infinite lifespan inspired us  to also use samples from physical instruments from a bygone age, such  as a famous old cello that still works in modern times thanks to the  wonders of digital circularity.” Taking the materials used in the  vehicle as a starting point, the duo also experimented with samples  and loops of sound elements, enabling them to discover a spectrum of  sounds produced by the materials in the car. Each and every tone  featured here captures the movements of the exterior structures, the  interior areas, the materials, the lights and the visual animations.Vehicle-to-grid opens up new possible uses.Alongside all its material and design innovations, the BMW i  Vision Circular also offers the possibility of usage in a  bidirectional charging scenario. Here, the vehicle would act as a  mobile energy storage device and feed power to its surroundings, e.g.  buildings and infrastructure. It can even be fed back into the power  grid to help absorb peaks in demand.Data-based smart mobilityfor maximum efficiency in urban traffic.Another  key measure in the drive towards sustainable urban mobility extends  beyond the actual vehicle: making intelligent use of the available  real-time and long-term traffic data for maximum mobility efficiency.  To date, the BMW Group has manufactured far in excess of 14 million  connected vehicles that are now on the world’s roads. What’s more, the  degree of connectivity and the precision of the sensor technology used  are constantly improving. The information gathered by each vehicle  isn’t just used to support its own functions though. With the user’s  consent, it is shared with the entire connected fleet, allowing all  vehicles to benefit from this swarm intelligence. Speed  recommendations could be optimised to make better use of traffic light  phases (“green wave”), traffic flows forecasted more accurately and  periods of congestion minimised as a result of vehicles communicating  with each other and their environment. CO2 emissions caused  by stop-start traffic or even searching for a parking spot could be  reduced significantly across a large number of users.Further insights with the BMW i Insight Vision  App.The BMW i Insight Vision App offers a novel new way  of experiencing and exploring the BMW i Vision Circular interactively.  The app uses a wealth of different examples to visualise the four  basic principles of circular economy – RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE and  RE:CYCLE. All aspects of the Vision Vehicle can be discovered in an  entertaining way with the help of augmented reality. Additional  information, background details and facts have been added to enrich  the user experience and offer a wide variety of insights into both the  design process and the materials and technologies used. The app’s  design has been modelled on the My BMW App. The BMW i Insight Vision  App experience is available exclusively on the show stand.RE:BMW Circular Lab – RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE and RE:CYCLE.The BMW Group is staging a RE:BMW Circular Lab as part of the  IAA event to provide further information on the topic of circular  economy. The BMW Group intends to win the public over to the circular  economy approach with this hybrid experience and communications  platform. Under the umbrella of the four fundamental principles of  circular design the RE:BMW Circular Lab invites visitors to the IAA to  gain a first-hand experience of what circular economy and circular  design mean during workshops. “Circular Heroes”, as they have been  named, will offer their users an easy, fun and artistic way of  familiarising themselves with the principles of circular design that  is also factually correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY.;As a completely new concept between bicycle and motorbike, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY taps into fresh possibilities for the innovative, urban mobility of the future.;Munich. As a completely new concept between bicycle  and motorbike, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY taps into fresh  possibilities for the innovative, urban mobility of the future. It is  one of five different concept vehicles that the BMW Group will use at  the IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich to showcase its vision of individual  mobility in and around the urban setting.Under the common umbrella of electric mobility, digitalisation and  sustainability, these five pioneering concepts form a versatile and  sustainably conceived mobility mix on two and four wheels that  comprehensively addresses a highly diverse range of mobility needs.BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY and BMW i Vision AMBY.AMBY stands for “Adaptive Mobility”. The BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY and  the BMW i Vision AMBY (see BMW i Vision AMBY press release) interpret  the fundamental idea of adaptive urban mobility on two wheels based on  differing facets. Both vehicles are electrically powered with three  speed levels for different types of road. The drive allows up to 25  km/h on cycle paths, up to 45 km/h on inner-city roads and up to a top  speed of 60 km/h on multi-lane roads and out of town. A helmet,  insurance licence plates and the relevant driving licence are required  to be able to travel at higher speeds, however. While the BMW i Vision  AMBY as a high-speed pedelec requires constant pedalling in order to  gain assistance from the electric drive, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY  is accelerated using the throttle grip and has footrests instead of  pedals, as is typical of a motorcycle.The modes available to the rider are stored in the app on the  smartphone that connects to the respective AMBY vision vehicle.Manual selection of the speed level is conceivable, as is  detection of the road by means of geofencing technology, thereby  allowing automatic adjustment of the top speed. As there is currently  no legal basis for such a vehicle with a modular speed concept, the  idea behind the AMBY vision vehicles is to prompt legislation that  will enable this kind of set-up. In this way, the BMW Group is  demonstrating that it will continue to be involved in providing  mobility options in big cities in the future and offers innovative solutions.New stimuli for emotional mobility on two wheels.“The BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY takes us into new territory. For us,  the focus is on user behaviour – the question is: how will customers  want to get around in the future? What will they expect their vehicle  to be capable of? This was precisely the starting point of our  deliberations. Our aim was to develop an extremely emotional vehicle  for smart mobility in and around the city that offered maximum  freedom. The BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY really does enable our customers  to experience urban life in a whole new way, cover distances more  flexibly and “break free” of the city from time to time, too. At the  same time, BMW Motorrad is consistently pursuing its electromobility  strategy for urban conurbations. It’s a fascinating introduction to  the world of BMW Motorrad that also promises maximum riding pleasure,”  explains Edgar Heinrich, Head of Design BMW Motorrad.The design – the DNA of BMW Motorrad.The BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY defies all existing categories: visually  akin to the world of bicycles, it is a motorbike at heart. Its slender  proportions promise ruggedness and adventure, while its design  suggests clear echoes of the expressive style and layout of an BMW  Enduro motorbike. With chunky treads on both the 26-inch front wheel,  which has a thinner tyre, and the 24-inch rear wheel with its more  rounded tyre, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY clearly shows that it is  both willing and able to go anywhere. The firmly integrated seat with  a height of 830 mm is just as typical a motorbike feature as the fixed footrests.The seat also acts as a design element over the flat, rising upper  frame section, creating a striking flyline. This produces a completely  new, fresh look for BMW Motorrad – a link between the e-bike and  motorbike world.The large energy storage unit and drive unit  form a dark graphic block at the centre of the frame.The large-dimensioned bicycle fork on the front wheel features  protectors and gives the entire front section a more massive, powerful  look. A small headlight with the U-shaped BMW Motorrad light signature  is a clear reference to the roots of the concept, as is the double LED  element as a tail light. Another BMW Motorrad feature is that the BMW  Motorrad Vision AMBY is accelerated from the handlebars, as is  customary on a motorbike.With a total weight of just 65 kg, the  BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY is significantly lighter than other  motorbikes, ensuring it offers excellent manoeuvrability and agility.Colour and material concept featuring depth and unexpected details.As compared to a conventional combustion engine, the concept of the  electric drive in the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY means there is little  in the way of visible mechanics.For this reason, its technical  heart is deliberately disguised and showcased in a striking  machine-like style. This accentuates the highly elaborated colour and  material concept, which goes well beyond the traditional dark  underlying colour scheme and use of white highlights.In its use of materials, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY  cross-references two other concept vehicles that will also see their  world premiere at the IAA Mobility 2021: The BMW i Vision Circular and  the BMW i Vision AMBY. The trim material used on the energy storage  unit – known as “floating grey polymers” – is also used in the bumper  of the BMW i Vision Circular. It consists of recycled plastic and can  itself be fed back into the material cycle at the end of the product  lifecycle. Meanwhile the material used for the seat is also to be  found in the saddle of the BMW i Vision AMBY and in the tyres of the  BMW i Vision Circular. Based on recycled plastic granulate and  sporting a fascinating terrazzo look, it demonstrates how several  materials can be given a second life with a new form and function.Asymmetrical design of the sides of the vehicle.In keeping with the unexpected, self-assured character of the BMW  Motorrad Vision AMBY, its two sides have deliberately been designed  distinctively. On both sides, the white “AMBY” lettering catches the  eye above the light-coloured drive unit, making a striking statement  as a stylised graphic on the trim of the energy storage unit. While  the lettering on the left gains additional visual depth from a  colourfully shimmering, iridescent drop shadow, the inscription on the  right appears deliberately without a drop shadow. Below the energy  storage unit there are two iridescent elements that add a further accentuation.On the right-hand side of the vehicle, three small turquoise blue  tubes visibly emerge from the silhouette, clearly alluding to the  electric heart of the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY. Next to this is a  quote by Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: „Electro-mobility will  be very significant for the future of motorcycling. We foresee a slew  of upcoming products with a focus on electric propulsion, particularly  in the field of urban mobility. And I’m not only thinking of classic  scooters here, but also of alternative modern, emotional products.  Electro-mobility on two wheels needs to be really fun and adventurous  and BMW is committed to developing corresponding products.”On closer inspection, the interplay between the technoid pixel font  with the classic serif font reflects a great attention to detail at  several points: together these bridge the gap between the past and the  future – just like the vision vehicle itself. The coordinates on the  right are a reference to the BMW Motorrad Design Studio in Munich,  where the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY came into being. On the opposite  side, the letters “AMBY” also appear in Morse code, but with dashes  visualising the dots. In their perfect interplay, all these carefully  conceived details create a unique graphic and a highly contemporary  sense of style.The smartphone as the key.The specially developed app enables the user to activate the BMW  Motorrad Vision AMBY for riding, read in their stored driving licence  classes and make use of the appropriate insurance cover on an  on-demand basis as required. In this way, the app performs the classic  key function while also making use of the customary identification  options provided by the smartphone such as Face ID. Basic functions  and status queries (e.g. current charge status) are available as in  the BMW App. Further developments and adjustments to the software can  be provided to customers at any time via over-the-air  updates.The smartphone shown in the vision vehicle charges  inductively on the magnetic holder in the rider’s lower field of  vision. These connectivity options would also allow anti-theft  protection and the freely programmable immobiliser to be offered as  basic functions.And the answer to the question “Where is my BMW  Motorrad Vision AMBY?” would be just a click away on the smartphone, too.Geofencing as a key technology.Instead of choosing the riding mode yourself, geofencing technology  combined with the detailed HERE map service could provide the required  parameters for automatically adjusting speed levels (25/45/60 km/h)  and the matching insurance cover. This technology enables the vehicle  to detect the type of road, cycle path or slow-traffic area currently  being used so that the maximum permitted speed can be automatically  adjusted. In this way, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY would transform  from a vehicle similar to an S-pedelec to something that is more  motorcycle-inspired. The user cannot override the mode. The required  licence plate takes the form of an innovative display surface, so the  mode selected at any given time can be easily recognised and read by  other road users.Additional technological innovations are conceivable for the BMW  Motorrad Vision AMBY, too: an optimised ABS system could further  increase safety, as could an automatic high beam or brake light  assistant, as well as daytime running lights. A tyre pressure  monitoring system such as the one already available as an optional  extra in BMW Group motorcycles is also conceivable. Finally, potential  safety features could also include a distance radar with a range of up  to 140 m to provide a visual and acoustic warning in the app when  there is a vehicle approaching from behind.The BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY shows one possible manifestation of what  the modern, urban mobility of tomorrow might look like. It is intended  as a blueprint to drive forward conversations about future-oriented  travel in cities.Figures of the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY.Battery: not specifiedOutput: not specifiedVmod1: up to 25 km/hVmod2: up to 45 km/hVmodmax: up to 60 km/hRange: approx. 110 km (combined according to WMTC)Wheels: Studded spoke wheels with 26-inch front and 24-inch rearSeat height: 830 mmUnladen weight: approx. 65 kg;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
P6 and P8: Michael van der Mark is the best-placed BMW rider on WorldSBK Sunday at Magny-Cours.;The eighth race weekend of the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Magny-Cours (FRA) drew to a close on Sunday with the Superpole race and race two. Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished sixth and eighth on his BMW M 1000 RR. His team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) was twelfth in the Superpole race and went on to finish tenth in race two. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team came home 18th and 16th.;Magny-Cours. The eighth race weekend of the 2021 FIM Superbike    World Championship (WorldSBK) at Magny-Cours (FRA) drew to a close    on Sunday with the Superpole race and race two. Michael van der Mark    (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished sixth and eighth    on his BMW M 1000 RR. His team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) was twelfth in    the Superpole race and went on to finish tenth in race two. Jonas    Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team came home 18th and 16th. Sunday at Magny-Cours began with the warm-up in the morning, in which  Sykes, van der Mark and Folger were fourth, ninth and 15th fastest.  That was followed by the Superpole race. After a strong qualifying,  Sykes again started from third on the grid, with van der Mark ninth  and Folger 19th. Sykes initially established his position in the leading group at the  start of the Superpole race, however fell back to eleventh place on  lap two. Van der Mark gradually worked his way through the field and  was running fifth at the halfway point, before dropping a position.  The Dutchman ended the ten-lap sprint in sixth place, which put him on  the second row of the grid for race two on Sunday afternoon. Sykes  came home twelfth, which earned him tenth place on the grid for the  second race. Folger finished 18th in the Superpole race. Folger was  promoted one position from 19th to 18th on the grid for race two, as  another rider was unable to start the race. Van der Mark made a strong start to race two and found himself in  fourth place for a brief spell but dropped back to sixth place on lap  six when he was touched by a rival whilst battling for fourth place,  the Dutchman just able to avoid crashing. He showed great fighting  spirit to battle back towards the front of the field, but was no  longer able to attack in the second half of the race. Van der Mark  dropped back to eighth place, a position he held on to through to the  finish. Sykes endured a difficult start, after which he was lagging in  18th place. However, he fought his way back to 14th on the opening  lap. By the end of lap seven, he was running in tenth place – a  position he maintained through to the end of the 21-lap race. Folger  also made a poor start, but improved in the second half of the race  and took the chequered flag in 16th place. Quotes after race two at Magny-Cours. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Tom’s had a really tough day to be honest. He’s not got into  his rhythm and got beat up a bit in both races and lost places. We  know the top ten are so close together and I don’t think Tom has had a  fair crack at it today so he will be disappointed with his  performance. Mickey had a good Superpole race. I think he did really  good to come through there, he had a good battle so to start the  feature race from sixth position was a really good step. It was a  strange race really. He got away really well and was in a tough battle  with the front guys. Then Andrea Locatelli made a hard but fair move  on Michael but it looks like the brake guard did its job and saved him  from what could have been a major accident because the gyroscopic  effect of the bike pulled Andrea back into the side of Mickey and he  had nowhere to go so it was very lucky. But he fought back and used a  lot of tyre which towards the end left him with no grip so eighth  position is all we could do today. A good race overall from Mickey and  I think we can come away from Magny-Cours with some positives. We have  tested at Catalunya, so we are looking forward to going there next.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning’s Superpole race was alright. I had good pace  and had a good feeling with the bike. I was just missing one or two  tenths to stay with Scott Redding and fight for fourth place. I was  confident going into the main race and had a strong start but then I  started to struggle after a few laps. I had some moments with a few  riders and lost a lot of time there but at the moment, the package is  just not good enough to fight every corner with the other guys. In  some corners we are losing too much time.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was  difficult today. Put me on a clear track and I can go front row, put  me on a clear track again in warm up and we can be consistently in the  top four. We just cannot ride with the others. Unfortunately, when I’m  with the other riders it becomes a lot more stop and start and we  can’t follow them when it comes to opening the gas. As soon as I got  clear track my lap times came down and were not too far from the fifth  position in terms of lap time, but we can’t bridge the gap at this  level. There’s a lot of information to be looked at, I will see with  the team where we can improve.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I struggled in the  races when the tank was full, particularly on the opening laps. I was  not able to hold my line in the corners, which meant I could not go on  the attack. The final third of each race was better – that was the  best section of the race for me. We must now find out why we have  these difficulties with the full tank. I will also see what I can do  differently as a rider, to ensure that I get the BMW moving better. On  the whole, it was another tough weekend for us. We will now analyse  everything and I will take a close look to see what I, personally, can  do better. Hopefully things will go our way at the next race weekend  at Barcelona.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Jeff Koons,  together with Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management, BMW  AG, announced today that the artist will create a special edition of  the M850i xDrive Gran Coupe. The luxurious 8 Series Gran Coupe will be  for sale in a very limited collector’s edition after its world  premiere at Frieze Los Angeles in February 2022. In 2010, the American  artist already created a unique BMW M3 GT2 Art Car which performed at  the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. That same year, the rock singer Bono  from U2 wrote in an editorial for the New York Times that Jeff Koons  should have a part in designing the car of the future. BMW and Koons  continued the conversation and are now proud to announce their latest  collaboration at the invitation of Angelika Nollert, director of Neue  Sammlung – The Design Museum, in Munich’s Pinakothek der Moderne.  Jeff Koons, Artist: “I am really thrilled and  honoured about the opportunity to work with BMW again and to create a  special edition car. I was thinking very intensely about it: What is  the essence of the 8 Series Gran Coupe? What is the essence of power?  How to create something that exemplifies all the energy of the BMW 8  Series that is also able to touch upon the human element? Again, it’s  just a wonderful opportunity to be working as part of the BMW family again.”“I am very proud to announce a new partnership with Jeff Koons. And  let me say: I love what he has come up with! The 8 Series Gran Coupe  is very close to our hearts and Jeff’s design of the car is full of  joy and passion. Ever since we relaunched our collaboration, Jeff has  said that he’s proud to be back with the BMW family. Dozens of  engineers and designers have given their all to celebrate our  partnership and make his vision come true. Welcome home, Jeff Koons!”  said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management, BMW AG.Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design: “In  2021, we celebrate 50 years of cultural engagement worldwide. We just  love the arts and the bold voices of our time. Our passion is emotion  and to be able to work closely with Jeff Koons again has been an  extraordinary source of inspiration. What better artist to collaborate  with on the 8 Series Gran Coupe? Car Design takes inspiration from Art  and Engineering and turns that into highly emotional experiences.  Working with  Jeff Koons again to jointly create something truly  special is a great pleasure. He is one of the greatest artists of our  time and one of the most inspiring and engaging human beings to work with.”Currently the cars are being produced in secret at the BMW Group  Plant Dingolfing, Bavaria. During an exclusive evening event at  Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich’s major museum of contemporary art and  a few days prior to the opening of the IAA MOBILITY 2021, Jeff Koons  and Oliver Zipse revealed first glimpses and close-up details of the  artist’s 8 Series Gran Coupe.THE 8 X JEFF KOONS is the embodiment of precision,  refinement and craftmenship, with a multi-layer paint taking 285 hours  to apply onto each car. The expressive and striking design combines  eleven different exterior colors ranging from blue to silver as well  as from yellow to black. Only two cars will be produced each week. The  multi-colored interior is comprised of high-end materials, fine  leather and a cupholder lid with an edition badging and the artist’s  engraved signature. The seats are made up of the striking red and blue  colors of the company’s high-performance unit BMW M. Overall, the  energetic and powerful design includes both elements of pop art as  well as geometric patterns paying homage to the sporty 8 Series Gran  Coupe’s intricate contours and shape.The BMW 850i was the first model of the 8 Series launched in 1990 and  was celebrated as creating a new perspective of progress in advanced  motoring, appealing to the connoisseur who acknowledges elegance and  performance as the ultimate blend of perfection. In February 2022, BMW  will present the special edition by Jeff Koons. On the occasion of the  announcement in Munich, the artist’s very own Art Car as well as those  by Alexander Calder, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert  Rauschenberg, John Baldessari and Esther Mahlangu are on display at  the Pinakothek der Moderne, showcasing the great legacy of BMW’s  worldwide commitment to the arts for half a century.For further questions please contact:Prof. Dr  Thomas Girst BMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Head of Cultural EngagementTelephone: +49 89 382  24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comDoris FleischerBMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Cultural EngagementTelephone: +49 89 328 27806Email:    Doris.Fleischer@bmw.dewww.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.de;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WorldSBK at Magny-Cours: Front row of the grid for Tom Sykes;The FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) is at Magny-Cours (FRA) this weekend for round eight of the 2021 season. In Superpole on Saturday morning, Tom Sykes (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished third to secure another place on the front row of the grid on his BMW M 1000 RR. In the afternoon’s opening race, his team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) finished fifth, while Sykes crossed the finish line in ninth place.;Magny-Cours. The FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK)    is at Magny-Cours (FRA) this weekend for round eight of the 2021    season. In Superpole on Saturday morning, Tom Sykes (GBR) from the    BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished third to secure another place on    the front row of the grid on his BMW M 1000 RR. In the afternoon’s    opening race, his team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) finished    fifth, while Sykes crossed the finish line in ninth place. Jonas    Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing Team came home 16th. Sykes was once again one of the top riders in Superpole qualifying.  The Brit briefly topped the timings, and eventually secured third  place and a spot on the front row of the grid with a time of 1:35.919  minutes. Van der Mark, who was unable to take to the track in the  morning’s third free practice session due to a technical issue  qualified ninth. Folger was 19th in qualifying. The air temperature rose to 26 degrees Celsius for the start of the  race in the afternoon, resulting in a track temperature of 40 degrees  Celsius. Starting third, Sykes dropped several positions at the start,  while van der Mark climbed into sixth place before falling back to  ninth again. On lap three, Sykes went very wide in turn five and  slotted back into the field in twelfth place. Meanwhile, van der Mark  had improved to seventh and soon took sixth place. The Dutchman  remained in that position until lap 17 of 21, when Alex Lowes (GBR /  Kawasaki) crashed in front of him, handing van der Mark fifth place –  a position he retained through to the finish. Sykes was involved in a  number of battles throughout the whole race in a fiercely-competitive  group of riders. After 21 laps of racing, he crossed the finish line  ninth. Folger initially dropped back at the start, but made some  progress through the field in the second half of the race to finish 16th. Quotes after race one at Magny-Cours. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Tom did a great job in Superpole, and we know he can do  that. His lap wasn’t a clean lap either so he was a bit disappointed  not to get pole, but happy with a front row start. Tom’s race was bit  disappointing for him;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The  new high-powered sports compact is the brand's first launch fully  executed and put into operation in Mexico.The San Luis Potosi Plant is the newest within the company's global  production network. From its design and construction, the Plant was  designed to easily adapt to produce different models. In just two  years since the Plant began production, it has enhanced operations to  include the manufacture of Plug-In Hybrid Electric vehicle and to  expand distribution to cover the globe. With an additional investment  of $125 million dollars, the facilities were improved to incorporate  this second vehicle into its production line.Harald Gottsche, President and CEO of BMW Group Plant San Luis Potosi  commented: “Two years after starting operations, our Plant integrates  a new model to its production line. This has been possible thanks to  the great talent of the team in San Luis Potosi. We are proud to be  able to exclusively assemble this vehicle in Mexico for the worldwide  market. With the new 2 Series Coupé we will show the enormous capacity  existing in this country. I am convinced that this will be the first  of many other successful launches”.Milan Nedeljkovic, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,  responsible for production, said: “The BMW Group Plant in San Luis  Potosi builds on the experience and best practices of the Global  Production Network. As the latest addition to the network, it benefits  from the latest innovative and highly efficient technologies, which  have also contributed to it becoming one of the company's most  sustainable production sites. Thanks to its flexible production system  and its highly qualified team, we can take Premium vehicles from  Mexico to the whole world”. Born in Mexico for the global market The new BMW 2 Series Coupé is a vehicle focused on dynamic  excellence. Its athletic and sophisticated line was conceived by Jose  Casas, a Mexican who is today a senior exterior designer for the BMW  Group in Munich.Once the design stage was completed, the BMW Group Development  division in Germany jointly collaborated with Production Planning in  San Luis Potosi to prepare the new model for the launch in Mexico.The Purchasing division also played a fundamental role from the  beginning of the project in the selection, development and  industrialization of local, regional, and global suppliers.Direct investment and adaptations to the plantPart of the additional investment was allocated to the expansion of  the existing facilities and the acquisition of additional equipment  necessary to assemble the new model. This included the installation of  a total of 82 new robots in the Body Shop, while the existing robots  required new programming to be able to handle parts with different  geometries, and to weld, rivet and bolt them together to combine an  intelligent mix of materials (steel, high strength steel and aluminum)  resulting in a light, yet highly rigid body that delivers the safety,  driving dynamics and efficiency that the brand's customers expect.Together with the Materials Analysis team, the Paint Shop was  involved in the launch of two new specific colors for the BMW 2 Series  Coupé;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Travelling safely to your destination with the “BMW Intermodal Companion @ IAA MOBILITY”. ;In-Car app provides intelligent combinations of different means of transport based on geo-fencing technology for navigation.  After single login, the application is installed in the vehicle via an over-the-air upgrade. ;Munich. Urban mobility is an important future topic  for every automobile manufacturer. By 2030, more than 80% of all  people will live in cities. Ensuring mobility is a high priority for  the BMW Group. However, mobility in urban areas can only succeed by  combining all mobility options. The BMW Group is therefore constantly  developing new solutions for optimising mobility within cities and in  the regions. It is important that individual mobility with your own  car can be combined with other mobility options. For the IAA, the BMW Group ensures that visitors will arrive at their  destination in their BMW safely and without traffic jams and also  avoid unnecessary inner-city traffic. The engineers of the BMW Group  have designed an “Intermodal Companion @ IAA MOBILITY” – an In-Car app  that offers visitors to the IAA various options, depending on their  route and destination. This vehicle app uses geo-fencing technology,  which already ensures that hybrid vehicles of the BMW Group drive  fully electrically in more than 80 European cities. BMW customers can register prior to the IAA with their ConnectedDrive  account via the website companion.bmw.de for the “Intermodal Companion  @ IAA MOBILITY”. It is then uploaded to their vehicle before the IAA  by an over-the-air upgrade process. Depending on their direction of arrival and IAA destination, users of  the In-Car app can select various BMW multi-storey car parks and  park&ride car parks in the city of Munich as parking and transfer  points. From there, they can easily reach their destination at the  trade fair or the Open Space. If intermodal arrival by public  transport is selected, users are automatically directed via the In-Car  app to one of the transfer points, where they can simply book a ticket  for the MVV (Munich public transport system) using a QR code. In the future, multimodal apps and connections to other mobility  providers will ensure that mobility for BMW customers in urban  environments is as smooth and uncomplicated as possible. Vehicle requirements:  Link to “BMW Intermodal Companion @ IAA MOBILITY” registrationpage:companion.bmw.de;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
 On the occasion of the IAA motor show, the BMW Group sends out a powerful visual statement about sustainability, the circular economy and electromobility. A light show projects trailblazing messages onto the BMW headquarters – the Four-Cylinder.; The BMW Group takes the opportunity of the IAA Mobility 2021 in its home city of Munich to convey visionary messages about sustainability and the circular economy Light show as part of a programme of public events in the Bavarian capital  Symbol of dialogue with society – both locally in Munich and digitally around the world  ;Munich. Tonight a spectacular light show will light  up the façade of the BMW Group headquarters in Munich on the occasion  of the IAA Mobility 2021. Four different animations addressing the  transition to future mobility will be projected on the world-famous  architectural icon that is shaped like a four-cylinder engine. The BMW  Group’s current messages will be conveyed by the 99-metre-high  building in the form of powerfully expressive, brightly coloured  animated sequences. Head of BMW Brand Communication and Experience,  Stefan Ponikva, emphasises the particular significance of the BMW  Tower and the importance of this campaign: “The Four-Cylinder is the  architectural icon of the BMW Group and a distinctive landmark in the  city of Munich. We’re keen to send out a powerful signal to the world  in support of a sustainable vision for a circular economy.”“The BMW Group continues to reduce its CO2 emissions and  is consistently expanding the circular economy: technological  advancements and innovative drive will enable us to tackle today’s  challenges together. That’s our unequivocal mission. And we intend to  demonstrate it at the IAA Mobility 2021,” says Alexander Bilgeri, Head  of Strategy, Services, Media House, Market Communications Europe,  China at BMW.Cycle of four animations focuses on the BMW Group’s circular economyThe various sequences on the cylinder-shaped façade visualise the BMW  Group’s approaches to CO2 reduction, climate neutrality and  the circular economy over the entire lifecycle of an automobile. From  low-impact extraction of raw materials and energy-efficient production  through to maximum efficiency during the customer use phase and  recycling at the end of the product’s lifetime.A sequence of different projections illustrates this cycle,  showcasing the circular economy – the BMW Group’s guiding theme at the  IAA 2021 – as well as the company’s accomplishments to date in the  electrification of its vehicles and the use of innovations such as  those in the area of digitalisation. One of the animations visualises  the transition from the combustion engine to electric mobility:  starting with the virtual up-and-down movement of pistons to portray  the combustion process in the cylinders, this then transforms into  colourful pulsating battery cells, finally announcing the status  “Fully Charged”. Another sequence is dedicated to the circular  economy. At the beginning of this animation, the building shell of the  Four-Cylinder Tower appears to melt, after which the inside of the  cylinders fills with liquid metal. From a vortex, the silhouette  gradually emerges of the “BMW i Vision Circular” – the study vehicle  being premiered at the IAA that symbolises the BMW Group’s extensive  expertise in the circular economy. The following words appear at the  end of this sequence: “WELCOME TO IAA. LET'S RE:IMAGINE TODAY.”Film music creator and Academy Award winner Hans Zimmer provides the  musical background for the light show;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW strengthens co-creation communication at IAA Mobility 2021: brand and its ambassadors produce content together and engage in discussion with their community. ; Munich trade fair becomes the heart of BMW co-creation with a worldwide network of personalities from various sectors of society  Collaboration as the key to authentic social media storytelling – especially for a young audience  Long-term and trusting partnerships, both in the past and for the future  ;Munich. BMW is setting new standards in co-creation  communication at the IAA Mobility 2021. At the trade fair, the brand  brings together a global network of ambassadors with a total range of  more than 100 million followers to collaborate on creative content and  ideas. “The automotive industry is currently engaged in a global  transformation. BMW itself is undergoing a process of rejuvenation and  finding new forms of communication. Partnership with BMW co-creators  supports this change,” explains Stefan Ponikva, Head of Brand  Communication and Experience.For BMW, the IAA Mobility 2021 is all about electromobility and the  circular economy. BMW has become a driver of innovation in both these  areas and is seeking to engage in debate on these subjects with  existing target groups as well as new ones. Getting young people  excited about the mobility of tomorrow is very important to BMW. One  promising way to achieve this is through co-creation. Credible  collaborations between the brand and its ambassadors are key to  authentic storytelling. Co-creation builds on long-term and trusting  cooperation with personalities and opinion leaders from various  sectors of society such as art, music, fashion, lifestyle,  sustainability and technology.BMW has already been very successful in the past with this approach,  and it is something that has been boosted by the pandemic: as part of  the #NextGen campaign 2020, BMW generated over 300 million impressions  on social media through strategic collaborations. Highlights include  the co-creation with Dude with Sign on the sustainable BMW i series, a  virtual MINI Vision Car for a virtual influencer, a YouTube talk show  with Alex Hirschi aka Supercar Blondie and a 3D print premiere of the  BMW iX.Creative content and high-reach social media activities are    being developed for the IAA Mobility 2021 in collaboration with    opinion leadersAt the IAA Mobility 2021, BMW turns its attention even more to the  needs and preferences of a digital audience. The co-creators provide a  plausible presentation to their digital target groups of what the  circular economy is all about and how BMW is making use of it to  become even more sustainable. Co-creation involves partnership with  BMW on an equal footing, whereby the ambassadors themselves take the  lead in (co-)producing the content: “We actively involve them in the  design of communication so as to open up new perspectives not only for  the BMW brand, but also for our partners and their audience. In this  way, we’re establishing BMW as a relationship brand and expanding  co-creation as a strategic component of BMW brand management,” says  Stefan Ponikva.A good example of creative collaboration is the cooperation with  sustainability ambassador and journalist Gemma Styles. She will be  discussing the urgency of sustainable innovations and technologies  with BMW CEO Oliver Zipse at the presentation of the “BMW iVision  Circular”. “I really enjoyed working with BMW on such an important and  challenging issue. BMW was totally open to co-creation and feedback.  It’s great to see a major brand showing authentic interest in a more  sustainable future – and I learned a lot, too.” The meeting in Munich  will also be used by some of the opinion leaders involved for the  exclusive production of social media content featuring the two BMW  electrically powered vehicles BMW iX and BMW i4 as well as the digital  IAA experience of BMW JOYTOPIA.The international co-creator community includes other well-known  personalities such as Academy Award winner Hans Zimmer, music producer  Steve Aoki and Brooklyn Beckham. Commenting on his collaboration with  BMW, the British photographer and Gen Z advocate says: “The years I’ve  spent with BMW have been a wonderful partnership. With its  forward-thinking design and innovative ideas, BMW embodies exactly  what it means to be an automobile brand. As a BMW global partner and  co-creator, I really enjoy sharing the brand’s stories through my own  eyes.” The co-creators also include highly acclaimed newcomers such as  singer Zoe Wees, skateboarder Nyjah Huston, actor Luka Sabbat, Alex  Hirschi – also known as Supercar Blondie, longstanding brand  ambassador Lena Gercke and well-known TikToker Younes Zarou.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Group and Telekom integrate 5G and Personal eSIM networking into a vehicle.; BMW iX first premium vehicle with 5G  Deutsche Telekom introduces the first mobile phone contract for a Personal eSIM in the car  ;Munich / Bonn. With the BMW iX, the BMW Group is the  first premium manufacturer to integrate the 5G mobile radio standard  into a globally available production vehicle and Deutsch Telekom is  offering the first corresponding 5G connectivity for such a vehicle.  The Personal eSIM can be easily extended and activated via an existing  contract with the MobilityConnect option. This makes the vehicle  another interconnected device for customers, like a smartwatch. They  benefit from the high bandwidth and low latency of 5G. The vehicle  provides significantly improved telephone quality* and enables a 5G  WLAN hotspot* for up to ten devices in the vehicle. The activated  Personal eSIM is linked directly to the BMW ID of the customer. It can  be used in any enabled vehicle including the corresponding functions.Mobility is entering the 5G era for the first  time.The new 5G mobile radio standard will  significantly increase the data transmission options compared to the  previous standard. This will create new, data-based applications and  increase the quality of existing applications many times over. For  mobility, this means a comprehensive extension of data-based services  in the fields of entertainment and infotainment, automated and  assisted driving and, above all, road safety. The 5G standard is a  decisive accelerator for future innovations in mobility and other  fields of application.Deutsche Telekom and the BMW Group use Personal eSIM and  MobilityConnect to connect the vehicle to the customer’s mobile radio  based on 5G for the first time. In addition, Telekom customers can  extend their existing mobile phone contract to their car for the first time. Personal eSIM, real ‘Dual-SIM-Dual-Active’ and WLAN  hotspotThe BMW iX is the technology flagship of the BMW  Group and represents a real world first in networking. 5G and eSIM are  being used in a production vehicle here for the first time.In  addition to the standard integrated vehicle eSIM, an additional  Personal eSIM will be integrated, as previously familiar from smart  devices such as tablets or smartwatches. The mobile phone technology  installed in the vehicle enables both eSIMs to be active with 5G  simultaneously with the full range of services (Dual-SIM-Dual-Active).  The BMW iX multi-aerial system, specially developed for 5G, routes the  radio signal from the performance-optimised multi-band aerials  directly to the vehicle's infotainment system via a Gigabit Ethernet  connection. In future, all passengers will benefit from the improved  connection quality and increased data throughput, because a WLAN  hotspot* can be activated in the vehicle via the Personal eSIM,  allowing up to ten end devices to surf or stream at 5G speed. At the  same time, it is no longer necessary to book an additional separate  mobile phone contract for the vehicle for a hotspot. The vehicle's  eSIM can be easily activated with the MobilityConnect option via the  existing mobile phone contract of the Telekom customer.“BMW has always been a pioneer in the networking of mobility. We  already installed the first SIM card in a vehicle back in 1997. With  the 5G Personal eSIM, we are now integrating a completely new level of  connectivity for our customers in the car in cooperation with Deutsche  Telekom.” says Stephan Durach, Senior Vice President of Connected  Company Development and Operations BMW GroupTelekom introduces the first 5G mobile radio option for the  carFor the first time, Telekom is introducing a special  rate option for integrated connectivity in the vehicle. When the BMW  iX is available on the market Telekom customers can extend their  mobile phone contract with the MobilityConnect option to include the  BMW iX and later other enabled models for 9.95 euros per month.“Telekom is the leading network provider in Germany - both in mobile  radio and in the landline network. With our new MobilityConnect mobile  radio option, we are bringing 5G networking into a vehicle as standard  for the first time. Our best 5G network makes premium connectivity  possible like in the BMW iX. We thus create completely new  applications for Telekom customers in the fields of entertainment and  infotainment and enable the increasing networking of the car”,  explains André Almeida, Managing Director Private Customers Telekom Germany.Simple booking via appThe booking can be easily  started in the vehicle and the customer is guided step-by-step by the  My BMW App or Telekom customer centre to the conclusion of the  contract. When you book the rate option, the eSIM is activated for the  vehicle. After a minimum term of one year, the rate option can then be  cancelled on a daily basis. Families can thus e.g. book the digital  services at short notice for the next holiday trip by car. It should  be possible to book the mobile phone option for the car for other  vehicle models as early as this year.Personal eSIM can be transferred to other enabled  vehiclesOnce the Personal eSIM has been activated using  the MobilityConnect option, the personal driver settings are not only  stored in the car, but also with the BMW ID. Customers can thus  transfer the settings of the Personal eSIM to other enabled vehicles  by activating the BMW ID. Activation of the Personal eSIM in the car  is carried out automatically with login with the BMW ID and is  immediately available. Customers thus turn every 5G-capable BMW (also  for rental or loan vehicle) into their interconnected device.* Presumably available as of the end of 2021.

BMW Group accelerates CO2 reduction and focuses consistently on a circular economy with the Neue Klasse;The BMW Group is increasing the pace of its efforts to combat climate change. Looking ahead to the introduction of the Neue Klasse, the company is further strengthening its self-defined objectives, announced in summer last year, to significantly reduce CO2 emissions, whilst also committing itself to a clear course that supports the 1.5 degree target for the limitation of global warming.;  Munich. The BMW Group is increasing the pace of its  efforts to combat climate change. Looking ahead to the introduction of  the Neue Klasse, the company is further strengthening its self-defined  objectives, announced in summer last year, to significantly    reduce CO2 emissions, whilst also committing itself  to a clear course that supports the 1.5 degree target  for the limitation of global warming. The Neue Klasse will  also see the BMW Group hugely increase its use of secondary  materials with a firm focus on the principles of the    circular economy, whilst also promoting better  framework conditions for establishing a market for secondary materials. To achieve a further reduction in CO2 emissions, the  focus is on the utilisation phase of vehicles, which  account for 70% of the BMW Group’s CO2 footprint. By  2030, the CO2 emissions per vehicle and kilometre driven will  be at least halved from 2019 levels. The commitment  of all manufacturers when it comes to combatting climate change can  best be compared when looking at the entire life  cycle of a vehicle, including production and upstream supply  chain. Here, the BMW Group is planning a reduction of CO2    emission per vehicle of at least 40%.  “How companies are dealing with CO2 emissions has become a major  factor when it comes to judging corporate action. The decisive factor  in the fight against global warming is how strongly we can improve the  carbon footprint of vehicles over their entire life span.

Revolution, not evolution: BMW Group to reduce carbon footprint significantly by 2030 using innovative materials. ; Measures to achieve 1.5-degree goal: BMW Group backs sustainable, innovative materials and circular economy  Higher recycling rates and material substitutions for faster reduction of lifecycle CO2 emissions by 2030  Innovative materials research and collaborations key factors in combating climate change;Munich. The BMW Group is stepping up its fight  against climate change with a unique sustainability strategy and  clearly defined CO2 targets, as announced by Oliver Zipse,  Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG at a media event in Munich.The main focus of the company’s pioneering strategy is, on the one  hand, to drastically reduce CO2 per vehicle by  2030. On the other, with the introduction of the “Neue  Klasse”, the BMW Group will be massively promoting the use of    secondary material and the forward-looking  principles of the circular economy. The BMW Group is  committing to a more sustainable pathway, with the goal of limiting  global warming to 1.5 degrees C.Fulfilment of all climate goals is closely tied to research    and development of sustainable materials. The BMW Group  believes only a holistic approach to the use of proven and new  materials can permanently reduce CO2 emissions. For this  reason, the BMW Group is focusing its research and development efforts  on environmentally-compatible raw materials. At the same time, it is  accelerating targeted the creation of a secondary-materials market and  working with select startups and experienced material suppliers to  develop pioneering materials.“We are setting new standards forsustainable premium quality – by rethinking materials  and focusing more than ever on resource-efficient alternatives and  renewable materials with strong dismantling capability,” said Dr  Stefan Floeck, head of Development Body, Exterior, Interior,  responsible for Product Line MINI, Compact Class BMW since 1  September. “We are following a consistent path towards holistically  sustainable product development, responsible use of resources and  transformation into a circular economy.”Innovative materials for a sustainable goalFor  both the interior and exterior, the use of intelligent, sustainable  materials forms the basis for resource-efficient car-building. The BMW  Group has defined material groups with sustainable properties that set  new standards and span all four dimensions of the circular economy:  RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE and RE:CYCLE.Integrating natural raw materialsThe BMW Group  has used renewable raw materials in its vehicles for a number of years  now – for example, in door trim panels, where a natural-fibre mat is  paired with a plastic matrix to provide the necessary stability.    Renewable raw materials like natural fibres are not  only 30 percent lighter than plastic alternatives,  they also come into the CO2 calculation with a    negative value, since they absorb CO2 and  release oxygen during the growth phase.In recognition of this potential, the BMW Group and its partners have  systematically further developed the use of fibres such as hemp, kenaf  and flax, providing them with natural fibre lattice structures. Thanks  to these support structures, it is possible to maintain their  mechanical properties and avoid additional weight by reducing the  amount of material needed.Wood can be used as a renewable raw material in many different areas  of application. The BMW Group is also conducting research into    pioneering wood foams with an open-pored structure made up  of finely ground wood particles. The foams’ resistance comes from the  wood’s own binding forces, which make it possible to dispense with  synthetic adhesives. The foams therefore consist of 100-percent  renewable raw materials and could replace acoustic foams in the future. Recycled plastics: smart and environmentally-friendly  The BMW Group already uses up to 100-percent recycled  plastic in its thermoplastic components and is working with pioneering  plastic manufacturers to further develop recycled plastics and bioplastics with a significantly lower carbon  footprint. In addition to recycled plastics, the company also employs  biobased plastics and plastics reinforced with natural fibres such as  cellulose, hemp, wood or bamboo to reduce the percentage of    oil-based primary plastics. The aim is to use  thermoplastics with an average of 40 percent recycled material by 2030.Innovative leather from new sourcesNew vegan  and resource-efficient leather alternatives are another important  element of the BMW Group’s research. Synthetic leather with biobased  raw materials, 100-percent recycled polyester textiles and cork  particles enable CO2 emissions to be reduced by up    to 45 percent compared to today's PVC synthetic leather. In  cooperation with the startup Adriano di Marti S.A. de C.V., the BMW  Group is researching a sustainable cactus-based material.  DeserttexTM is made from pulverised cactus fibres  with a biobased polyurethane matrix. Another promising alternative to  leather is the fully recyclable MirumTM,  which mimics all the properties of traditional leather, yarns and  foams. The BMW Group’s equity investment in the startup Natural Fiber  Welding opens up new possibilities for developing and implementing  plant-based material options.Textiles – reimagined and 100-percent  recyclableAs part of its research and development  activities, the BMW Group is working on innovative materials with the  potential for use in future vehicles. These include synthetic    textile variants, which are mostly used for seat covers.  They have a low carbon footprint and can be manufactured from    100-percent recycled material. Thanks to their  composition, they can repeatedly be fed back into the cycle    and reused several times over the course of their product  lifecycle. The BMW Group aims to use more  mono-materials, instead of multi-layered,  multi-material approaches. In seats, for instance, the cover and the  foam beneath it are currently made of different materials. These can  neither be easily separated out nor recycled together to create a new  material that can be used in vehicles. The various connecting elements  between the materials, such as adhesives and yarn, also play a role in  this. If both parts are made of the same material, it is possible for  them to be recycled within the circular economy. The BMW Group is also  employing new techniques to give textiles a new appearance, using 3D  structures, applications, templates and graphic elements, and working  on a new material mix for series introduction.With these and many other innovative measures, the BMW Group seeks to  raise general awareness of sustainable materials and provide a  transparent insight into its circular approach to a sustainable future  – with the aim of reducing lifecycle CO2 emissions    by more than 40 percent by 2030.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Group Classic participates in the “DRM Revival” in Spielberg.;BMW 320 Group 5 “Junior Team” to compete alongside Marc Surer (CH) at the DRM Revival at the Red Bull Ring during the supporting programme of the DTM. ;Munich/Spielberg. BMW Group Classic will compete with  a BMW 320 Group 5 in the “DRM Revival” at the Red Bull Ring in  Spielberg being held by DTM Classic from 3 – 5 September 2021. It was  possible to gain Marc Surer (CH) as the driver who will race the  vehicle with the classic “BMW Junior Team” design of 1977.Marc Surer was a member of the “BMW Junior Team”, which was  established at that time, and can hardly wait to step on the gas in  Spielberg: “Some 44 years after starting with the BMW 320 Group 5 as a  member of the BMW Junior Team in Zolder, it is a very special  experience for me to be amongst the competitors at the DRM Revival.”He will be accompanied by the current BMW Juniors Dan Harper, Max  Hesse and Neil Verhagen. The initiator of BMW Junior Team of 1977,  Jochen Neerpasch, does not intend to miss the spectacle and will also  be attending the event.For Norbert Knerr, racing manager of BMW Group Classic, the line-up  is historic bridge building: “We couldn’t have found a better  framework to deploy the BMW 320 Group 5. To see Marc Surer at the  wheel of his 1977 vehicle at the DRM Revival in Spielberg, accompanied  by the current BMW juniors and Jochen Neerpasch, is definitely an  occasion that couldn’t be more fitting and emotional.”The “DRM Revival” organised by DTM Classic will take place during the  DTM Racing Weekend at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg/Austria, being  held from 3 to 5 September. The historic vehicles of the Divisions 1  and 2 will, in addition to training and qualifying events, also  compete in two races.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02. ;A breath of fresh air for urban electric mobility on two wheels.;Munich. With the Concept CE 02, BMW Motorrad is  presenting a new interpretation of smart, urban single-track mobility  one week before the IAA Mobility 2021. The electric vehicle concept,  which is neither a classic motorcycle nor a scooter, is an exciting  and highly emotional mobility offer.“At first glance, there is little about the BMW Motorrad Concept  CE 02 that is typically BMW Motorrad – it’s something completely new.  We want to strive for something novel and be pioneers – which is what  we’ve proven ourselves capable of with various projects in the past.  The Concept CE 02 features new proportions and modern forms of  single-track mobility in an urban environment. In addition, we wanted  to achieve a level of design innovation that we have not had before at  this level. Straightforward use was important, but above all the  emotional component was crucial, as well as riding fun,” explains  Edgar Heinrich, Head of Design BMW Motorrad.With its compact dimensions and youthful proportions, it also  clearly appeals to a new target group: people aged 16 and over, who  have not ridden a motorbike before but are open to new experiences,  smart technology and, above all, combining mobility with fun. As a  lightweight e-vehicle weighing about 120 kg, the BMW Motorrad Concept  CE 02 is ideal for urban use, offering a high fun factor as well as  straightforward yet stylish commuting. The 11 kW of output and all the  torque available from standstill allow for fast acceleration at  traffic lights. A top speed of 90 km/h and a range of 90 km make it  easy to get from A to B – and back again – even in heavy city traffic.The design expresses a new facet of BMW Motorrad.The overall look of the two-wheeler reveals the novel character of  the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 at first glance. “We wanted to develop  an easily accessible two-wheeler for everyone who wants to be  mobile and independent,” says Alexander Buckan, Head of Vehicle Design  BMW Motorrad. “The BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 is a reliable companion  on a day-to-day basis. You love it because it’s always there for you  and it just works – even if you occasionally don't treat it as  carefully as you might. And there are stickers, tapes and other forms  of customisation that make it quite clear to everyone that it belongs  to you. It embodies youthful freedom and a carefree spirit – rather  like a skateboard on two wheels.”The simple and transparent proportions ensure an honest,  emotional aesthetic appeal. Two large-size wheels, similar to a fun  bike, promise robustness and straightforward riding fun. They are  designed as disc wheels, thereby emphasising the proportions of the  vehicle graphically. The dark area for the two battery units and the  drive with silver accentuations create a compact body. The long,  narrow seat and the frame round off the distinctive silhouette.A new introduction to BMW Motorrad. Thanks to the flat vehicle body, the centre of gravity is low and  favourable when it comes to riding dynamics. At the same time, the BMW  Motorrad Concept CE 02 looks inviting and confidence-inspiring thanks  to the large disc wheels and low seat height. Characteristic  proportions not only allow for a very agile riding experience, they  are also intended to encourage non-motorcyclists to perhaps get on and  have a go.The continuous seat reflects the versatility of the concept.  Whether leaning far back with your feet first or leaning forward with  your feet on the rear footrests or, of course, with two people – the  seat allows numerous sitting positions since no foot brake lever has  to be operated due to the electric drive. In addition, the free space  between the seat and frame offers room for small luggage items. In the  front area of the seat, there are two crossed-over petrol-coloured  elastic bands attached in such a way as to enable smaller items to be  casually tucked in. Further storage space is provided by the brackets:  the front footrests are mounted here, too. You can also attach your  own skateboard here and use it as a footrest.High-quality details on closer inspection. The purist design reveals high-quality details and technical  refinements on closer inspection. Light is provided by a square, black  headlight with four distinctive LED elements as front headlights. The  rear light comprises two small, translucent LED leaves that are fixed  to the left and right of the rear seat. A small colour screen on the  handlebars provides basic display functionality: this is connected via  a visible, visually deliberately overemphasised cable harness.  Otherwise, the technology is deliberately restrained. In combination  with the disc wheels and the single-sided swinging arm, the showcased  elements such as the drive belt, handlebars and fork emphasise the  urban, modern character of the concept bike in detail.The colour scheme puts the rider at the centre.In terms of colour, the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 also keeps things  purist: black/silver is the underlying scheme. The colour black is  reminiscent of early BMW motorbikes. What is new here, however, is the  interplay of matt and high-gloss surfaces, giving the concept bike  greater expressiveness. Silver-coloured elements such as the triple  clamp or the drive, the white graphics and the petrol-coloured luggage  straps set targeted accentuations, breaking up the overall image.  Technoid typography is used as an active design tool, conveying the  association with technical information on machines. The BMW emblem is  integrated on the whitish silicone seat just in front of the  handlebars;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW SIM News, August 2021.;BMW SIM Racing has an extensive and diverse programme in store for the Esports community in 2021 – from BMW SIM Cups and BMW SIM Racing teams to technical innovations. In our monthly BMW SIM News, we briefly summarise news from the world of virtual racing, and provide information on driver backgrounds, teams, technology, and much more. ;BMW SIM GT Cup.After a summer break of two and a half months, the second half of  this year's BMW SIM GT Cup season started with three races in August.  This time, the world’s best sim racers were competing at the wheel of  the virtual BMW M4 GT3, having completed the races during the first  half of the season with the BMW M8 GTE. Tuomas Tähtelä and Pekka  Tuomainen (both FIN) from the KOVA team claimed victory in the opening  race with the BMW M4 GT3 on 1st August at the Imola circuit, booking  their ticket for the year’s final at BMW SIM Live 2021. The teams in  second to fifth positions qualified for the Season 2 finale, which  gives them another chance to secure a spot at the year’s final. They  will compete against the teams crossing the line in second to fifth  positions in the other three races taking place in the second half of  the season. Teams and drivers that have already qualified from Season  1 will not be classified in these standings. Others will move up to  take their places. Two further spots have already been claimed.  Alejandro Sánchez and Cristian Lamela (both ESP) from the MSI eSports  team will both be there after triumphing in the second race in August  at the virtual Circuit of the Americas. The third race at the 'Mount  Panorama Circuit' in Bathurst was won by Maximilian Benecke (GER) and  Enzo Bonito (ITA) from Team Redline. However, as they had already  qualified for BMW SIM Live, the tickets went to their team-mates Chris  Lulham (GBR) and Patrik Holzmann (GER) in second place. One more  regular race is scheduled for 24th October at the Monza circuit. The  Season 2 finale at the Hockenheimring will take place on 14th  November. There will then be 24 drivers confirmed to race off for the  year’s title at BMW SIM Live 2021. Defending champion is Joshua Rogers  (AUS) from the Coanda Simsport team. He has already secured his return  to the finale by claiming a win in the virtual BMW M8 GTE in the first  half of the season. BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup.Just like the BMW SIM GT Cup, the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup also  kicked off the second half of this year’s season in August. The  settings for the two races held thus far were the circuits of Monza  and Sebring, where Diogo Silva (POR) from the GTC Race Center team and  Lorenz Hörzing (AUT) from the Jochen Schweizer Sim Racing Team secured  their places at BMW SIM Live 2021. Silva needed no more than a  fourth-place finish in the opening race, as the three drivers on the  podium had already claimed their tickets for the finale in the first  half of the season. The win went to Erhan Jajovski (MKD). The second  race at the virtual Sebring International Raceway was won by Michal  Smidl (CZE) ahead of Hörzing. As Smidl had already qualified, Hörzing  was also able to claim a spot. In September and October, four more  races at the circuits of Lime Rock Park, Loch Drummond,  Spa-Francorchamps and Indianapolis will provide the opportunity to be  part of the year’s finale at BMW SIM Live 2021. Jajovski will be there  as he attempts to defend the title he won last year. BMW SIM Teams at Formula Medicine.For many years, BMW Motorsport has trusted in the expertise of  Formula Medicine to ensure that the BMW works drivers can enjoy  optimal physical and mental preparation for their competitive  appearances. At the end of July, selected drivers from the BMW SIM  Team also had the chance to gain some valuable insights into the  training methodology at Formula Medicine during a workshop in  Viareggio (ITA), and to get some important ideas for their own  training schedule. The multi-day workshop included fitness and mental  coaching sessions. These were accompanied by reaction exercises and  nutritional advice. Enzo Bonito (ITA) and Kevin Siggy (SLO) were the  BMW Team Redline representatives, Arthur Kammerer and Gregor Schill  (both GER) took part for BMW Team G2 Esports, Nikodem Wisniewski (POL)  and Petar Brljak (CRO) took part for BMW Team GB and Elias Seppänen  (FIN) and Attila Dencs (HUN) represented BMW Team BS+COMPETITION. “The physical training was certainly useful for me as a sim racer, as  we are also subjected to relatively significant force feedback effects  on the arms, wrist and elbows through the steering wheel. It is  important to strengthen these areas and to do something for the knees  and stamina in general,” was Kammerer’s summary. “However, the mental  coaching was the most valuable aspect for me – and that was the most  fun part too. We had these multitasking exercises that showed me how  easy it is for unexpected events or distractions to knock me out of my  routine. I will now integrate exercises like this into my regular  training routine. Good multitasking is helpful even just to discuss  strategies during the race or to correctly calculate the amount of  fuel without losing concentration, missing the right braking or  steering points and therefore posting a poor lap time. Having the  mental capacity for both things was an important core topic of the  workshop. Overall, a perfect combination for mind and body.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"MINI and URBAN-X present ""Love the City x Hate the City"": How can we make our cities more livable?";Rethinking coexistence in cities: The start-up Accelerator URBAN-X, initiated by MINI, is facing urban challenges with its new video campaign and presenting innovative solutions from creative thinkers. ;"Munich. What if we could preserve the best sides of  city life and change the worst? In the video campaign ""Love the  City x Hate the City"" (#LTCxHTC), MINI presents different aspects  of life in the city as well as the associated challenges and presents  projects of the current cohort of the start-up accelerator URBAN-X. As  part of this promotion of aspiring entrepreneurs, MINI is working with  creative thought leaders to find new solutions for greater equity,  participation and design opportunities.""With #LTCxHTC, we celebrate our passion for cities and the  people who live in them. We are giving the start-up founders and their  courageous steps to tackle the most pressing challenges in our cities  – such as mobility, security, urban infrastructure and energy – a  stage,"" says Bernd Körber, Head of the MINI brand.MINI operates the start-up accelerator URBAN-X together with the  American venture fund Urban Us. The program was founded by MINI in  2016. Since its launch, more than 70 start-ups from different  countries have already gone through the accelerator. A new cohort of  up to ten urbantech start-ups is assembled every six months – selected  from more than 1000 applications per year.In a creative exchange with designers, engineers and developers of  MINI, the founders of the selected start-ups are supported in the  further development of their business model. The innovations created  in this process address some of the most pressing urban challenges,  from building technology and infrastructure to mobility and energy  supply to public health and civic services. They create cities that we  can all love.“Amidst the pandemic, cities around the world are confronting issues  of equity, access and opportunity while at the same time addressing  resiliency and sustainability. With people rediscovering what they  love about their cities and new solutions to address climate change  and improve quality of life cropping up across the globe, now is the  perfect time to reimagine city life and support the innovators who aim  to do so,” said Micah Kotch, Managing Director of URBAN-X.As part of the #LTCxHTC campaign, four innovative start-ups from the  current cohort will also be presented. For example, the start-up  Circuit, which offers free rides on-demand in bustling inner cities as  an emission-free short-haul service. Circuit mediates passengers via  app, helping to reduce congestion and eliminate the need for annoying parking.The communication platform OneRoof helps people who live in the same  house to network, get to know each other and feel more supported.  Their goal is to turn a group of people who live under the same roof  into a house community.Thanks to modular, customizable bike pods, Oonee offers safe storage  for scooters and bicycles in inner-city metropolitan areas. The  easy-to-install pods facilitate sustainable urban mobility and enhance  public space through seating and roof greening.The start-up Thrilling is also part of the current URBAN-X cohort.  Founded in the United States, the company is the first e-commerce  platform to specialize in supporting small, independent vintage and  secondhand stores. By communicating these offers, customers have the  opportunity to minimize their ecological footprint when choosing their clothing.MINI also remains true to its founding idea in supporting urbantech  start-ups: to challenge the status quo and thus develop new,  sustainable mobility solutions for city dwellers. With URBAN-X, MINI  supports entrepreneurs, engineers and designers in the development of  sustainable, vibrant and sustainable cities.At the International Motor Show IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich, visitors  can find out about URBAN-X at the exhibition stand at the Summit on  the exhibition grounds as well as in the MINI Pavilion on Lenbachplatz  from 7 September to 12 September 2021 and learn more about the  promising start-up teams and their projects.

WorldSBK at Magny-Cours: BMW Motorrad Motorsport returns to familiar territory.;Having visited the two new circuits of Most (CZE) and Navarra (ESP), BMW Motorrad Motorsport is returning to familiar territory this weekend. From 3rd to 5th September, the eighth round of the FIM Superbike World Championship 2021 will take place at ‘Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours’ in the heart of France.;Munich. Having visited the two new circuits of Most (CZE) and    Navarra (ESP), BMW Motorrad Motorsport is returning to familiar    territory this weekend. From 3rd to 5th September, the eighth round    of the FIM Superbike World Championship 2021 will take place at    ‘Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours’ in the heart of France. The BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team and riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael der    Mark (NED) already know the circuit very well from the WorldSBK.    Jonas Folger (GER) and the Bonovo MGM Racing team, who are competing    in their first full season in the WorldSBK, have already made a    guest appearance at Magny-Cours in the French Superbike Championship FSBK. Magny-Cours lies around 250 kilometres south of Paris, the French  capital, and has been a fixture on the WorldSBK calendar for nearly 20  years. A world championship race took place there for the first time  in 1991 and WorldSBK has visited Magny-Cours each year since 2003. The  combination of fast corners with long, straight sections and tight  hairpin bends makes for a challenging track layout. Quotes ahead of the Magny-Cours round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  Magny-Cours layout has a bit of everything and is an interesting  challenge for teams and riders. We have been very competitive there  over the last two years. Tom Sykes reached the podium in 2019, while  Eugene Laverty and Tom claimed double pole in a great Superpole  qualifying in 2020. However, this year sees us visit Magny-Cours a few  weeks earlier, which could mean different conditions – it will be  warmer, even though we can probably expect some rain to make an  appearance, as usual. We have set up our BMW M 1000 RR to be ready for  all eventualities. Our aim is to give ourselves a good start position  in qualifying and to keep on reducing to the gap to the very front  during the race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “The team is looking forward to Magny-Cours. It is a circuit  that has suited the BMW in the past. We have made some good steps  forward with the BMW M 1000 RR and I think the improvement that we  showed in race two at Navarra, we’ve got to keep building on that. The  Magny-Cours circuit is fast and flowing with some slower parts and we  feel that Tom and Michael can have a positive event. FP1 is going to  be really important;" that is one of my favourite parts of the track, but also the  last sector is always nice for some good overtaking. I am looking  forward to the weekend. We have improved our BMW M 1000 RR a lot and  at Navarra, we struggled more with the high temperatures and I think  we will not have that at Magny-Cours, so hopefully we have a bit more  stable weekend. At Navarra, we made a big step lap-time wise in  qualifying. Unfortunately for me it was so tight that I was still  tenth, but if you look at the lap times, I made a huge step. We  improved the performance there, so that is what we really need at  Magny-Cours as well.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Magny-Cours is a  great circuit. We competed as wildcard starters in the French  Championship there last year. I am happy that we did that, as it means  that I am familiar with the circuit now. It is a very challenging  circuit, including a real range of corners. There is a pretty long  straight, some slow corners. Sometimes it flows and then you have a  bit of stop-and-go - it has a bit of everything. I hope that we make a  good start to the weekend, work well with the BMW from the word go and  that our race results then build on recent races.”  Track Facts Magny-Cours.Circuit        length4.411          km – clockwiseCorners17 – 9 right-handers, 8 left-handersPole        positionRightLongest        straightApprox. 900 metres (‘Golf’)Grip levelMediumTrack        layoutSome          sweeping turns, some stop-and-go passages, fast changes of directionStrain on        brakesRelatively highAmount at full        throttle32          % respectively 31 secondsTop speed / lowest        speed295          km/h / 46 km/hBest overtaking        opportunityT5Key        factorsHigh          speed through the corners, stability, good delay on entry into          turns, wide range of performance """;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

RE:IMAGINE: New temporary exhibition at the BMW Museum to coincide with the IAA Mobility 2021 documents the BMW Group’s path to sustainable mobility in the future.; Focus on transition to electromobility and circular economy.  Exhibition on five levels of the BMW Museum shows activities and visions for increased sustainability.  Pioneering spirit and development expertise as driving factors behind progress.  Exhibition to open ahead of the IAA Mobility 2021 on 1 September 2021 and last until January 2023. ;"Munich. The BMW Group is currently undergoing the  most far-reaching transformation process in its more than 100-year  history, leading the company directly to the sustainable mobility of  the future. A new temporary exhibition at the BMW Museum documents how  the BMW Group is facing up to the challenges this involves, as well as  demonstrating current activities and visions geared towards  sustainable driving pleasure. Under the title “RE:IMAGINE – We’re  making BMW sustainable”, all facets of this transformation will be  highlighted, from purely electric drive systems, CO2  reduction throughout the entire vehicle lifecycle, the idea of the  circular economy and rigorous environmental standards in the supply  chain through to social sustainability in the procurement of raw  materials as well as in day-to-day working life at BMW Group sites all  over the world.“RE:IMAGINE” will open at the BMW Museum on 1 September 2021,  providing a powerful impetus in the run-up to the IAA Mobility 2021 in  Munich, which also focuses on sustainability as a future theme. On  five levels and covering a surface area of some 1 000 square metres, a  diverse tour featuring some 30 individual stations has been installed  that present the key highlights of the automotive industry’s  realignment. Entertaining, interactive and hands-on elements convey  complex issues in way that visitors of all ages can understand. The  new temporary exhibition will be on display at the BMW Museum until  January 2023.""RE:IMAGINE"": A holistic view of the transformation    process of the BMW Group.From the global framework  conditions to milestones from the past and present to the latest  innovations and visions for the future, the ""RE:IMAGINE""  exhibition provides a holistic overview of the central role  sustainability plays for the BMW Group. Based on diverse social trends  and the pressure to act caused by climate change, visitors to the BMW  Museum learn in which fields of action - products and services,  production and value creation, employees and society - the company, as  a global pioneer in its industry, has made sustainability the basis of  its activities.Visitors can see and experience the wide variety of areas in which  new thinking contributes to resource conservation, emission reduction  and economic and social responsibility. Visitors receive insights into  current research projects and learn about the BMW Group's various  approaches to protecting the environment, habitats and human rights.  At the relevant stations, information is provided, for example, on the  use of regeneratively generated energy in vehicle production,  transparent supply chains, efficient drive types for different needs,  the establishment of a comprehensive circular economy and the  recycling rates of current BMW and MINI models, which already far  exceed the legal requirements. The exhibition also shows how digital  services support efficient mobility and how new thinking in vehicle  development with a conscious reduction of components and materials  leads to sustainable design.Sustainability: firmly anchored in the workforce and in the    tradition of the BMW Group.After “BMW i – Visionary Mobility”, the BMW Museum once again devotes  itself to a current as well as future-oriented theme in its new  temporary exhibition. The title “RE:IMAGINE” expresses the capacity of  the BMW Group and its employees to conceive and shape things in a  completely new way. The pioneering spirit, commitment and innovative  spirit of the company's employees has a key role to play in tackling  the changes. In both the development and production of automobiles, as  well as in many other areas of the company, the pursuit of  sustainability is firmly anchored in the workforce. In order to  reflect this, 35 personalities from various departments of the BMW  Group are portrayed in the exhibition.Added to this is a company tradition that is closely linked to  innovative and efficient solutions as the key to success. Even in the  very early days of the company, which was originally founded in 1916,  BMW aircraft engines were not only highly reliable but also economical  in terms of fuel consumption, too – the perfect basis for successful  long-distance flights. BMW’s first motor racing accomplishments as a  car manufacturer were also largely based on the kind of facets that  can be summarised today under the heading of sustainability. The BMW  328 dominated the action on the racetrack primarily due to its  fuel-efficient in-line 6-cylinder engine and lightweight body. This  was how it succeeded in winning the 1940 Mille Miglia endurance race –  despite being up against numerous much stronger competitors. BMW has  dedicated itself to electric mobility since the early 1970s.  Electrically powered variants of the BMW 02 were used as escort  vehicles for the marathon race at the 1972 Munich Olympics, for  instance. They were the concrete expression of the vision of  emission-free mobility and became a globally respected and still  legendary symbol for a new form of driving pleasure. In the following  year, the company appointed an environmental officer for the first time.Via Efficient Dynamics to carbon-free premium mobility: the    BMW i3 was just the beginning.With its Efficient Dynamics technology package, the BMW Group created  a concept back in 2007 that remains unique in the automotive industry  to this day. The continuous reduction of fuel consumption – and  therefore CO2 emissions – has gone hand in hand with a  consistent increase in driving pleasure. In addition to intelligent  lightweight construction and optimisation of aerodynamic properties,  one of the key elements is the broad portfolio of drive systems.  Whether highly efficient petrol and diesel engines that can be  supplemented with 48-volt mild hybrid technology, plug-in hybrid  systems that allow a lot of day-to-day driving to be taken care of on  a locally CO2-free basis, or purely electric motors – all  are based on the principle of Efficient Dynamics. With this wide  range, the BMW Group is a global supplier of premium automobiles that  meets the diverse requirements of customers all over the world.  Another option for emission-free premium mobility is hydrogen fuel  cell propulsion: at the IAA Mobility 2021 the BMW Group presents the  BMW iX5 Hydrogen, which is fitted with this technology and will be  produced next year in a small series for testing and demonstration purposes.With the launch of the BMW i brand and the development of the world’s  first premium automobile designed from scratch for purely electrically  powered mobility, the BMW Group has also recently taken on a  pioneering role in sustainable mobility. The BMW i3 (combined power  consumption: 16.3 – 15.3 kWh/100 km according to WLTP, 13.1 kWh/ 100  km according to NEDC) has come to symbolise locally  CO2-free driving pleasure in an urban environment. With the  BMW iX3 (combined power consumption: 19.0 – 18.6 kWh/100 km according  to WLTP, 17.8 – 17.5 kWh/ 100 km according to NEDC) and the MINI  Cooper SE (combined power consumption: 17.6 – 15.2 kWh/100 km  according to WLTP, 16.9 – 14.9 kWh/ 100 km according to NEDC) as well  as the BMW iX and BMW i4 models to be available soon, the BMW Group  brands offer purely electrically powered cars in numerous vehicle  categories. In the coming years, these will be followed by fully  electric model variants of the BMW 5 Series and BMW 7 Series, the BMW  X1 and the successor to the current MINI Countryman. By 2023, the BMW  Group’s product range will include 13 fully electrically powered  models, covering 90 per cent of all vehicle segments.CO2 emissions: the entire vehicle lifecycle in view.In the past, the BMW Group has always addressed the right issues at  the right time, not least when it comes to effectively tackling  climate change. The main goal here is to achieve carbon neutrality. In  2020 the BMW Group developed its own agenda that is even more  ambitious than the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement target of limiting  global warming to below two degrees Celsius. This is why the company  is well prepared to meet the requirements of the EU’s “Fit for 55”  programme, which requires CO2 emissions of new car fleets  to be reduced by 55 per cent from 2030. In the long term, the BMW  Group has set itself the goal of establishing a climate-neutral  business model across the entire value chain by 2050.Today, every vehicle is measured by its carbon footprint. Based on  continuously increased efficiency and consistent electrification, the  BMW Group succeeded in reducing the CO2 emissions of its  brands’ vehicle fleets by 53 per cent between 1995 and 2020. But  increasing sustainability is not just about the drive. The entire  lifecycle has to be taken into account – from the procurement of raw  materials and production through to the use phase and subsequent recycling.Optimisation of manufacturing processes has enabled the BMW Group to  reduce the energy requirement per vehicle in production by more than a  third as compared to 2006. In addition, vehicle production at all BMW  Group sites worldwide is carbon-neutral as of this year. All BMW Group  plants have been making exclusive use of green power since 2020. Four  wind turbines have been generating green electricity at the BMW Group  plant in Leipzig since 2013, while the BMW Group plants in Munich and  Dingolfing draw their electricity from regional hydroelectric power  plants. At the Chinese site of the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint  venture, at the British MINI plant in Oxford and at the BMW Group’s  newest plant in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, large-scale solar  installations contribute to generating the electric power required for  production. Energy generated from methane gas obtained from a local  landfill is used at the US BMW Group plant in Spartanburg. In terms of  the figures, the company’s administrative offices and other properties  do not emit more carbon dioxide than they absorb.The BMW Group has set itself the goal of avoiding the emission of  more than 200 million tonnes of CO2 through consistent  optimisation in production, in the supply chain and in the use phase  of the vehicles. Emission reductions in the supply chain include  initiatives to produce aluminium using solar power,  CO2-free steel production and the use of renewable energy  in the manufacture of high-voltage batteries for electric vehicles.  For example, the BMW Group plant in Landshut recently started using  aluminium produced by means of solar energy in the desert of the  Emirate of Dubai. This means that in future 43 000 tonnes of aluminium  – around half of the annual foundry requirement at the BMW Group’s  largest component plant – will be produced on a climate-neutral basis.  What is more, only green electricity is used for the production of the  battery cells for the fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology.The goal: ten million purely electrically powered vehicles in    the next ten years.The BMW Group placed electromobility at the centre of its  developments at an early stage in order to achieve a consistent  reduction in CO2. Launched in 2013, the BMW i3 is the  result of a holistic concept for sustainability that goes far beyond  purely electric power. This compact e-vehicle with its pioneering  design and passenger cell made of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic  (CFRP) also took on a pioneering role in the field of intelligent  lightweight construction. By the end of 2020, more than 200 000 units  of the BMW i3 had been sold worldwide.At the same time, the BMW Group has expanded its range of plug-in  hybrid models in recent years to include almost all relevant vehicle  classes – from the compact segment, the mid-range and the BMW X models  through to the luxury performance segment. The combination of an  efficient combustion engine with an electric motor makes it possible  to take care of most day-to-day driving with zero local emissions. The  BMW Group provides incentives for electrically powered driving based  on innovative digital services such as the BMW eDrive Zones and the  globally unique BMW Points reward programme.In Germany, almost one in four new cars of the BMW brand and around  30 per cent of all newly registered MINI vehicles are now fitted with  an electrified drive. Worldwide, the BMW Group plans to put a total of  one million fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road by  the end of 2021. The share of all-electric vehicles in the BMW Group’s  total sales is to be increased to more than 25 per cent by 2025,  reaching 50 per cent by 2030. In total, the BMW Group aims to put  around ten million fully electrically powered vehicles on the road  around the world in the course of the next ten years.New vehicle platforms are being designed that enable the use of fully  electric drive systems as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel  cell technology. Furthermore, the BMW New Class models to be launched  from 2025 onwards will set entirely new standards in the areas of  circularity and digitalisation as well as sustainable drive technology.With its model range tailored to maximum driving pleasure in urban  traffic, the British brand MINI is predestined for electric mobility.  MINI took on the role of pioneer in the field of electric mobility in  the BMW Group back in 2008. With the MINI E produced in a small  series, field testing generated crucial findings on the use of a  purely electrically powered automobiles in day-to-day traffic. With  the MINI Cooper SE, the brand has now made an extremely successful  start to its all-electric future. By the beginning of the 2030s, the  MINI model range will exclusively comprise purely electrically powered vehicles.The BMW Motorrad range also includes models for locally emission-free  mobility in urban environments. The latest example of sustainable  driving pleasure on two wheels is the all-electric BMW CE 04 scooter.  With a range of up to 130 kilometres, it is suitable for both  day-to-day commuting and lengthier trips. Just like the BMW CE 04, all  new BMW Motorrad models designed specifically for urban mobility will  be powered by electricity only in the future.In addition, the BMW Group is committed to expanding the charging  infrastructure. With the public charging services BMW Charging and  MINI Charging, customers have convenient and transparent access to one  of the largest charging networks in existence, comprising more than  200 000 charging points in Europe. In Germany alone, the network  offers more than 40 000 charging points. In addition, the IONITY High  Power Charging service can be used via BMW Charging, enabling  particularly fast charging at capacities of up to 350 kW and with a  total of 2 000 charging points throughout Europe. In cooperation with  E.ON, the BMW Group is operating a network of 5 000 charging points in  Germany up until the end of 2021 that supply 100 per cent green power.The BMW Group as a pioneer in the development of the circular economy.When it comes to sustainability, the BMW Group thinks far beyond  emissions. With its “RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE, RE:CYCLE” approach,  the company provides a holistic outlook on how the use of primary raw  materials for the automobile of the future can be drastically reduced.  The company is striving to achieve a circular economy that involves as  many raw materials as possible being recycled. In view of the scarcity  of resources and increasing raw material prices, the BMW Group  believes that this step will be crucial to maintain sustainable  business operations as well as being a clear efficiency imperative.The share of secondary materials – such as recycled steel, plastic  and aluminium – will see a marked increase the New Class models from  2025 onwards. Under the motto “Secondary First”, later recycling is  already being taken into account in the development of new models.  Preference is given to the use of secondary materials wherever the  quality and availability of the materials allow.A key challenge involved in today’s recycling processes is the  extraction of materials in a very pure form. For this purpose, wiring  systems have to be easy to remove prior to recycling, for instance, so  as to avoid mixing the steel with copper from the vehicle’s wiring  harness. The reduction in the number of components, material groups  and surface finishing contributes significantly to increasing  recycling rates. The use of mono-materials for the interior, such as  in the seats, is one example of the principle of circularity. The aim  is to return the greatest possible amount of material to the resource cycle.In the development of electric motors and high-voltage batteries for  the fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, close consideration was  given to recycling in addition to resource conservation. The design  principle of the electric motors makes it possible to do without  materials from the rare earth metal sector. This makes the BMW Group  independent of the availability of these critical raw materials. The  high-voltage batteries in current BMW and MINI models with electrified  drive systems can serve as stationary storage facilities for a long  period of time after being used in a vehicle and before their  materials can finally be re-processed for renewed use. The  high-voltage batteries of the fifth generation of BMW eDrive  technology are particularly suitable for circular re-use of raw  materials. In this case, the choice of materials and design allow a  recycling rate of up to 90 per cent. The housing of the high-voltage  battery in the BMW iX consists of some 30 per cent secondary  aluminium, while in the battery cell the proportion of secondary  material is as high as 50 per cent for nickel – an important raw  material. In addition, further development of battery cell technology  has reduced the proportion of cobalt in the cathode material to less  than ten per cent.Remarkable progress towards a circular economy has been made in other  areas, too. At the BMW Group plants in Germany and Austria, for  example, a closed material cycle has been established for toolmaking.  Carbide tools are predominantly made of tungsten";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Patrick Cantlay wins the BMW Championship in an epic playoff.;After an enthralling final round duel with Bryson DeChambeau, Patrick Cantlay has secured the prestigious BMW Championship 2021 title and his first Playoff victory. Victory had to be decided in a playoff, after both tied on a total score of -27 – the lowest winning score to par in the history of the tournament.;Baltimore/Munich. After an enthralling final round duel with    Bryson DeChambeau, Patrick Cantlay has secured the prestigious BMW    Championship 2021 title and his first Playoff victory. Victory had    to be decided in a playoff, after both tied on a total score of -27    – the lowest winning score to par in the history of the tournament.    DeChambeau was unable to match Cantlay’s birdie at the sixth extra    hole, having passed up several good opportunities to claim the win    during the playoff.“On behalf of everyone at BMW, I’d like to congratulate Patrick  Cantlay on winning the 2021 BMW Championship, and say thank you to  everyone who worked so hard to make this event a success,” said Oliver  Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “We at BMW have  long considered the U.S. to be our second home, and this event is an  important part of what we do – beyond serving as a national platform  for our brand and products, it also provides an opportunity to raise  money for the Evans Scholars Foundation.”Cantlay and DeChambeau, who played together in the final group on  Sunday, quickly pulled away from the field to put on a duel that  seemed more like matchplay. With Cantlay one stroke behind at the  17th, it seemed that the result had been decided when he landed his  drive in the water. However, DeChambeau only recorded a bogey after a  chip shot went wrong, allowing Cantlay to stay in the running with a  bogey of his own. Cantlay then kept his sporting chances alive,  sinking a 21 yards on the 18th green while his rival missed from much  closer in.This pattern was set to continue in the playoff: DeChambeau put on a  brilliant display with the driver and his irons and on several  occasions he was presented with an easier putt to claim victory – but  he proved unable to sink them, while Cantlay got himself out of a  tight spot more than once with challenging putts. The decisive moment  came at the sixth extra hole for Cantlay, who had been by far the  strongest player on the greens throughout the week.South Korea’s Sungjai Im claimed third place, four strokes back  (-23), ahead of Rory McIlroy (NIR, -22) and Erik von Rooyen (RSA,  -21). Sixth place was shared by Dustin Johnson (USA) and Sergio García  (ESP, both - 20), who are approaching top form just in time for the  PGA TOUR Final and the Ryder Cup after middling seasons.All proceeds from the BMW Championship benefit the Evans Scholars  Foundation (ESF) and its mission of awarding full tuition and housing  college scholarships to caddies who would otherwise not be able to  afford to study. The BMW Championship has contributed more than 36  million dollars to the foundation since the tournament debuted in  2007. The final total for the 2021 tournament will be calculated in  around a week’s time. Alongside the ticket sales, the revenue from the  Pro-Am tournament also makes an important contribution. This year’s  Pro-Am event featured 23-time Olympic swimming champion Michael  Phelps, rapper Macklemore (both USA) and star photographer Paul Ripke  (GER) on the tee.The BMW Championship represented the final opportunity for US golfers  to score points for the Ryder Cup. The first six players in captain  Steve Stricker’s squad have now been confirmed: Collin Morikawa,  Dustin Johnson, Bryson de Chambeau, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas and  Patrick Cantlay. Stricker will call up another six wild card entrants  after the TOUR Championship. Qualification for the Ryder Cup Team  Europe will end after the BMW PGA Championship (Wentworth Club, 9th to  12th September).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW WorldSBK rider Eugene Laverty (IRL) and his wife    Pippa visited Berlin in mid-August and had a busy schedule. Their    first port of call was the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin-Spandau,    where they were given a warm welcome. During the tour of the plant,    the Lavertys took a look behind the scenes of the motorcycle    production and met many of the employees. From Spandau, they travelled to Berlin-Tempelhof. Laverty  had been planning to visit his BMW colleagues in the FIA Formula E  World Championship for a long time, and finally had the opportunity to  do so at the finale of the 2021 season – the BMW i Berlin E-Prix  presented by CBMM Niobium. It goes without saying that he also took to  the track on two wheels. Appropriately for the Formula E finale,  Laverty took the brand-new, fully-electric BMW CE 04 scooter for a  spin. “I really enjoyed my time in Berlin where I was able  to combine a visit to the BMW plant as well as the final round of the  Formula E World Championship,” Laverty said. “I felt a fantastic  camaraderie amongst my BMW colleagues both at the plant and at the  race track. I’d never before had the chance to visit somewhere quite  like the BMW plant, the level of technology and the quantity of bikes  produced daily is phenomenal!” “It was cool to get the  chance to ride the track layout on the brand new electric BMW CE 04  scooter,” Laverty continued. “The bike is such an impressive piece of  kit ideal for riding around the city.

Plastics labeled HDPE, LDPE or PP are ideal. Digital live talk at the FUTURE FORUM by BMW Welt and the 1E9    think tank on the circular economy on September 9. To combat climate change, pollution and the consumption levels of a  growing population, it will not be enough simply to reduce  CO2 emissions. Instead, our economic system must be  transformed so that we stop squandering resources and avoid as much  waste as possible by recycling all materials. The aim must be to  create a circular economy. While the theoretical concept is easy to  understand, implementing such a circular system presents challenges.  Together with experts from business and politics, we aim to find out  what solutions already exist and what needs to be done to help the  circular economy make the break-through.The live stream of the event in English is available free of charge  on the website    of the FUTURE FORUM by BMW Welt and on the Facebook channel of BMW    Welt & BMW Museum. FUTURE FORUM by BMW Welt Genius Sessions BMW Welt guided tours at the IAA at a glance.  Deep dives on BMW i, BMW M and BMW Luxury (30 minutes each) If you have any questions please contact:LHLKOn behalf of BMW WeltStefanie FredrichEmail: bmw-welt@lhlk.dephone: +49 89 720-187-17;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW M Motorsport News, 24th August 2021.;Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you an overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams.;DTM: Marco Wittmann enjoys more success in the BMW M6 GT3 at    the Nürburgring.Two weeks after taking victory at Zolder (BEL), Walkenhorst  Motorsport again had cause for celebration at round four of this  season’s DTM at the Nürburgring (GER): Marco Wittmann (GER), in the  #11 BMW M6 GT3, finished third in race two to claim another podium.  Wittmann had previously secured a promising third place on the grid in  Saturday’s qualifying for race one. However, the team knew that it  would be tough to achieve a podium finish, due to the extra 25  kilograms he was carrying following the victory at Zolder. At the end  of the 40-lap race, Wittmann crossed the finish line in fifth place. In a wet qualifying for race two on Sunday, the two-time DTM champion  again put the #11 BMW M6 GT3 third on the grid. The safety car then  made two appearances in an eventful race. As Walkenhorst Motorsport  had already come in for an early pit stop, Wittmann had to fight his  way back past those drivers that had not yet stopped at the restarts.  He did so superbly and ultimately came home in third place to secure  the final spot on the podium. “That was one of the most eventful races  of my DTM career,” said Wittmann. “The second restart was particularly  chaotic. We were five cars side-by-side coming into the first corner,  and I just hoped that I would somehow get through in one piece. I  passed five or six cars within just a few corners. It could easily  have gone wrong, but it worked out and I had a lot of fun.” Wittmann  now lies third in the Drivers’ Championship. The ROWE Racing team had a mixed weekend. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)  fought back from 18th on the grid to finish sixth in the #31 BMW M6  GT3 in Saturday’s race. In the Sunday race, the South African was in  with a shout of a podium finish until his BMW M6 GT3 was hit by  another car at the second restart. The result was a broken steering,  which forced van der Linde out of the race. His team-mate Timo Glock  (GER) had to settle for 19th place in the Saturday race. However, the  tide turned on Sunday when Glock, in the #16 BMW M6 GT3, worked his  way from 20th on the grid to eighth place. In doing so, he scored his  first points of the DTM season. After the race, he was promoted to  seventh place following a penalty handed to one of his rivals. DTM Trophy: One-two for the BMW M4 GT4 in the Eifel mountains.BMW M Motorsport teams in the DTM Trophy once again impressed with a  strong display at the Nürburgring (GER). Saturday’s race produced a  one-two for the BMW M4 GT4. The dominant driver was Ben Green (GBR) in  the #10 BMW M4 GT4 of FK Performance Motorsport. Starting from pole,  Green took a comfortable lights-to-flag victory. Michael Schrey (GER)  followed him home in second place, in the #2 BMW M4 GT4 of Hofor  Racing by Bonk Motorsport, to make it a BMW one-two. Schrey finished fourth in the Sunday race, but was then handed a  five-second penalty which saw him relegated to eighth place. The  best-placed BMW driver was Yann Zimmer (SUI) in the #50 BMW M4 GT4,  who finished sixth for FK Performance Motorsport. His team-mate Green  finished just behind him in seventh, ahead of Schrey. Green and Schrey  lie second and third in the Drivers’ Championship. Green trails the  current leader by just three points. BMW M2 Cup: Exciting battle for the championship lead.The new BMW M2 Cup was also at the Nürburgring (GER) at the weekend  for its third event of the season. An exciting battle for the  championship lead developed over the course of two thrilling races on  Saturday and Sunday. In Saturday’s opening race, Louis Henkefend (GER) took a comfortable  second win of the season in the #17 BMW M2 CS Racing. He crossed the  finish line almost six seconds clear of his closest rival. In doing  so, Henkefend extended his championship lead - briefly. “That was a  perfect race,” said Henkefend afterwards. “I grabbed the lead in turn  one and then had a clear track in front of me. I am really happy, as I  have scored valuable points in the championship.” Behind him, Fabian  Kreim (GER / #43) and Nicolas Hancke (GER / #99) were embroiled in a  hard-fought battle for second place. Kreim had the upper hand for a  long time, but it was Hancke who eventually prevailed and took second  place. As such, the podium featured Henkefend, Hancke and Kreim. Race two on Sunday was another thriller with the drivers in the BMW  M2 CS Racing cars making a host of spectacular manoeuvres on a dry  track. This time, it was Hancke who added victory to the second place  he recorded on Saturday. “It has been a long road onto the podium. I  was lacking a bit of pace in the first few races, but it was better  here at the Nürburgring. I am incredibly happy with the result,” said  the #99 BMW M2 CS Racing driver. Second place went to Kreim, with  Davit Kajaia (GEO / #5) taking third. Henkefend had to settle for  sixth place after receiving a penalty for failing to observe track limits. That result saw the championship lead change hands and Kreim is the  new leader with 97 points. Henkefend is now second with 95 points,  followed in third place by Hancke (76 points). The BMW Junior Team  visited the BMW M2 Cup paddock at the Nürburgring weekend. Dan Harper  (GBR), Neil Verhagen (USA) and Max Hesse (GER) called upon their  experience to give the drivers some valuable tips. More information on  the BMW M2 Cup is available on the official website: bmwm2cup.com.  There, you will find images and videos to download in the ‘Media’ section. GTWC: New driver pairings for Walkenhorst Motorsport.Walkenhorst Motorsport will compete with three established drivers  and three new drivers in the cockpits of the two BMW M6 GT3 in the  remaining two races of the season in the Endurance Cup, within the  FANATEC GT World Challenge Europe, at the Nürburgring (GER, 5th  September) and Barcelona (ESP, 10th October). Jake Dennis (GR) will  make his GT debut for BMW M Motorsport alongside regular driver David  Pittard (GBR) in the #34 car. Just a few days ago, he ended his rookie  season in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship with BMW i Andretti  Motorsport in third place in the overall standings. The third driver  in the all-British line-up will be Nick Yelloly (GBR). At the wheel of  the #35 BMW M6 GT3, regular drivers Martin Tomczyk (GER) and Thomas  Neubauer (FRA) will be ably assisted by Nick Catsburg (NED). Catsburg  and Yelloly not only won the 2020 Nürburgring 24 Hours together in a  BMW M6 GT3, but also raced for Walkenhorst Motorsport in the  Intercontinental GT Challenge so know the team very well. The change  in the driver line-up is due to a schedule clash with the DTM, in  which Marco Wittmann (GER) is driving for Walkenhorst Motorsport on  the same weekends, while Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Timo Glock  (GER) compete for ROWE Racing. Super GT Championship: BMW Team Studie in action at Suzuka.BMW Team Studie was back in action in the Japanese Super GT  Championship last weekend – this time at Suzuka (JPN). The  300-kilometre race was originally scheduled for the end of May, but  had to be postponed to August due to the coronavirus. The #7 BMW M6  GT3 of BMW Team Studie was once again driven by Seiji Ara and Tomohide  Yamaguchi (both JPN). In Saturday’s qualifying session, the duo was  14th fastest. However, in Sunday’s race, which took place under cloudy  skies and in temperatures of about 30 degrees, the #7 dropped back  through the field as the result of a drive-through penalty. In the  end, Ara/Yamaguchi came home in 25th place. GT4 Scandinavia: Second event of the season at Gelleråsen.GT4 Scandinavia staged its second event of the season last weekend.  This time, Gelleråsen Arena (SWE) hosted the two races. Flying the  flag for BMW was the 996 Lestrup Racing Team with the #98 BMW M4 GT4.  Alternating at the wheel were Joakim Walde and Victor Bouveng (both  SWE). The duo had previously taken victory and claimed another podium  result in the Pro-Am class at the season-opener at Fällfors (SWE) in  June. At Gelleråsen, Walde/Bouveng finished fourth, narrowly missing  out on another podium. They were then unfortunate and failed to finish  in race two on Sunday. BTCC: Milestone victory for Colin Turkington at Knockhill.Colin Turkington (GBR) reached a milestone at round five of the  British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) at Knockhill (GR) in  mid-August. In the first of the three races, Turkington took a  comfortable victory in the #2 BMW 330i M Sport run by Team BMW – this  was the team’s 100th victory in the BTCC and the 75th time they had  celebrated together with BMW. Turkington then finished runner-up in  race two. His team-mate Stephen Jelley (GBR) stepped onto the podium  after race three, having finished third in the #12 BMW 330i M Sport.  Turkington ended the third and final race of the weekend in eighth  place. After five race weekends, BMW tops the Manufacturer standings  with 439 points and a lead of 55 over its closest rivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Top five for Tom Sykes and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team on Sunday at Navarra.;BMW Motorrad Motorsport has rounded off the WorldSBK race weekend at Navarra (ESP) by meeting the objective of securing a top five result for the BMW M 1000 RR. Tom Sykes (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team claimed fifth spot in race two on Sunday afternoon. His team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) was classified in ninth. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team finished twelfth, his second-best race result of the season.;Navarra. BMW Motorrad Motorsport has rounded off the FIM    Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) race weekend at Navarra    (ESP) by meeting the objective of securing a top five result for the    BMW M 1000 RR. Tom Sykes (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team    claimed fifth spot in race two on Sunday afternoon. His team-mate    Michael van der Mark (NED) was classified in ninth. Jonas Folger    (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team finished twelfth, his    second-best race result of the season. Sykes started the Superpole race in the morning from third place. He  fell back a little at the start, taking the chequered flag in sixth  after ten laps. Van der Mark improved from tenth on the grid to ninth  and moved up to seventh for a while, before losing a place and  crossing the line in eighth position. Folger slipped back several  places after starting from 14th but was able to regain ground with  some overtaking manoeuvres as the sprint race progressed and finished 16th. Sunday saw a repeat of the previous day’s high temperatures and the  start of race two was delayed by ten minutes after a rider experienced  some issues on the grid. The lights went out at 14:10. After a  hard-fought first lap, Sykes and van der Mark had moved up from sixth  and eighth into fourth and fifth positions. However, Andrea Locatelli  (ITA, Yamaha) was able to pass van der Mark on lap three and overtook  Sykes one lap later. That put Sykes in fifth place, and he maintained  that top five position to the finish line after 22 laps. Van der Mark  was seventh for a large part of the race, but lost a place in the  closing stages and took the chequered flag in eighth position. After  the race, van der Mark was demoted by one place for exceeding track  limits on the final lap. Folger started the race from 14th on the  grid. After the start, he fell back briefly to 16th place but then  worked his way back up through the field, crossing the line in twelfth. Navarra hosted the seventh round of the 2021 WorldSBK season. The  racing continues in two weeks at Magny-Cours, France, from 3rd to 5th September. Quotes after race two at Navarra. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “That  was not an easy weekend for us, but we did manage to finish all three  races with Tom and Michael in the points. Jonas also scored points in  both main races. We didn't do as well as expected in the Superpole  race this morning in the cooler conditions, however we did manage to  claim sixth and eighth on the grid. That was certainly an improvement  compared to the most recent races for Michael. It then paid off in the  second race. After both made a good start, we were in fourth and fifth  positions. Tom then fell back to fifth place but did some great  defending against Alex Lowes. Michael certainly had more of a battle  on his hands but compared to yesterday we closed the gap to the  leaders by seven seconds. That's still not enough but it's going in  the right direction. In the heat today, they both chose a different  front tyre to yesterday, which will have made the biggest difference –  and now we have to learn from that for the next high-temperature  events coming up in Spain and Portugal.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It was a good step of improvement from yesterday. Tom rode  very well today;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
   First row of the grid and solid race results for the BMW M 1000 RR on a hot WorldSBK Saturday at Navarra.;The first race day of the debut FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) event at Navarra, Spain, has come to an end. Tom Sykes (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team gave a strong performance in Saturday morning’s Superpole on his BMW M 1000 RR, claiming third place to secure a spot on the front row of the grid. Sykes finished the afternoon’s race in sixth position. His team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) crossed the line in seventh.;Navarra. The first race day of the debut FIM Superbike World    Championship (WorldSBK) event at Navarra, Spain, has come to an end.    Tom Sykes (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team gave a strong    performance in Saturday morning’s Superpole on his BMW M 1000 RR,    claiming third place to secure a spot on the front row of the grid.    Sykes finished the afternoon’s race in sixth position. His team-mate    Michael van der Mark (NED) crossed the line in seventh. Jonas Folger    (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team was also in the points,    finishing 14th. 1:36.546 minutes was the lap time recorded by Sykes in the morning’s  Superpole qualification. That enabled him to take the lead for a brief  period before finishing the 15-minute session with third place, on the  front row of the grid secured. Van der Mark ended the hard-fought  qualifying session in tenth position. Folger qualified in 14th place.  A special surprise lay in wait for van der Mark on the grid later when  BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers and Shaun Muir, BMW  Motorrad WorldSBK Team Principal, presented the new father with a BMW Babyracer. Air temperatures had already reached 24 degrees Celsius by late  morning, climbing to over 30 degrees by the time the race began. Sykes  fell back a little in the turmoil at the start but then maintained  sixth position for the duration of the 23-lap race. He was within  striking distance of the top five for some time, but the gap then grew  larger. Van der Mark was able to get into eighth before moving up to  seventh on lap seven, where he remained until reaching the finish  line. Folger dropped back after losing ground at the start, however he  moved up to 14th as the race progressed to secure a points finish. Quotes after race one at Navarra. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Sixth and seventh in the race – that corresponds to where we  are at the moment. Our pace was clearly better in this morning’s  practice. The temperatures kept climbing though as the race  approached. We had already struggled with that in practice yesterday.  Tom did very well in qualifying to secure a great third place. He  established himself in sixth position relatively quickly in the race  and was able to maintain that. Michael had a relatively good  qualifying session. He finished tenth but was just a tenth of a second  away from fifth. In the race, he lost a few seconds again during the  first laps. Our aim for tomorrow should be fifth place instead of  sixth and seventh. It is important for us to deliver a strong  performance tomorrow in the Superpole race, with the aim of reaching  the top five. That is realistic for us this weekend.”  Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “I was really pleased with FP3 in the morning when Michael  set a quick pace very early so he had a good run of laps and was  confident going into Superpole. Equally Tom found a good set-up as  well and was pretty happy so we quickly confirmed the tyre choice for  the rear tyre. In Superpole, Tom as usually did a great job putting it  on the front row in the top-three. He made good use of his qualifying  tyre. We used a slightly different strategy for Michael;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cars as colourful as life; BMW Group Plant Leipzig has today started production of the BMW 1 Series and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe in Individual paintwork finishes  Choice of approx. 160 colours  BMW Individual realises exclusive wishes of customers  ;Leipzig. “Cars as colourful as us” – That’s the motto  of an associate initiative to raise awareness among the team of  diversity at BMW Group Plant Leipzig. But this motto is now gaining an  additional meaning as the automotive world in Leipzig welcomes a  wealth of new paint options. Starting today, the plant is finishing  vehicles in Individual paintwork as well. The first BMW 1 Series and  BMW 2 Series Gran Coupes for those who prefer less ordinary colours  are resplendent in Speed Yellow, San Marino Blue, Verde Ermes Green  and Nardo Grey.Black and white are still among the most popular colours for cars,  but customers are increasingly seeking more expressive and individual  paintwork. Dealerships now offer 160 Individual colour options for the  BMW 1 Series and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe, which are going down well  with customers despite the surcharge for matt and Individual finishes.  Leipzig’s order books for vehicles with Individual finishes have  filled up nicely until the end of the year, and the next major order  is for 180 BMW 118d vehicles in Hockenheim Silver, Ruby Red and Sepia  Violet for BMW Japan.The lead time for special finishes in a preferred Individual colour  is about ten weeks. Customers can even create their own colours, which  will be specially mixed and used on their car only.So that Individual finishes can be applied to smaller model series  too, the existing system has now been upgraded to handle the special  paints. In addition, new paint supply systems and a new mixing area  have been integrated. The paintshop can now paint five vehicles a day  in colours from the Individual range.The integration of the special new colours means extra service and  supervision work for the paintshop team compared with what’s needed  for standard finishes. Some processes, such as sign-off, can no longer  be carried out by automated means and have to be performed manually  instead, so the paintshop team has been expanded. For matt finishes  the process is especially time-consuming and complex, as defects  cannot be treated in the conventional way that is used with gloss  finishes. Instead, each matt-finished car takes 30 minutes longer to  prepare. There are currently two matt colour options: Frozen Black and  Frozen Orange.Individual paint finishes may only just be starting at Plant Leipzig,  but already the orders are revealing a few special favourites:  yellows, blues, reds and violet shades are especially popular at the  moment, bringing plenty of colour not only to the streets but also to  Plant Leipzig’s paintshop and production lines.The full range of options can be experienced via the BMW Individual Visualiser:https://visualizer.bmw-individual.com/Ipps/bmwoac?market=80001-de&pdf=1&qrcode=1&header=1&page=imc&lang=en&dc=1-1#top;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We  are therefore convinced that Scott, with his fighting spirit and  absolute will to win, is the perfect new addition for the BMW Motorrad  WorldSBK Team and another reinforcement for our entire WorldSBK  project. A warm welcome to Scott, we are looking forward to a strong collaboration.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK  Team: “We have been following Scott’s career for a number of  years and are delighted that he will now become a part of our team.

   The next first for BMW Motorrad Motorsport: WorldSBK heads to Navarra for the first time.;For BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the FIM Superbike World Championship presents a first for the second time in two weeks. After the debut of ‘Autodrom Most’ (CZE) on the calendar, now ‘Circuito de Navarra’ in northern Spain will host the WorldSBK for the first time. This coming weekend (20th to 22nd August), the seventh round of the 2021 season will be held at the track.;Munich. For BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the FIM Superbike World    Championship presents a first for the second time in two weeks.    After the debut of ‘Autodrom Most’ (CZE) on the calendar, now    ‘Circuito de Navarra’ in northern Spain will host the WorldSBK for    the first time. This coming weekend (20th to 22nd August), the    seventh round of the 2021 season will be held at the track. BMW    Motorrad Motorsport had the opportunity to familiarise itself with    the new track back in June. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team with    riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED), as well as    Bonovo MGM Racing and Jonas Folger (GER) completed a test at the    track with their BMW M 1000 RR Superbikes. The ‘Circuito de Navarra’ is located near Los Arcos in the regional  community of Navarra, around 60 kilometres southwest of Pamplona. The  modern racetrack, just under 4 kilometres in length, was opened in  June 2010. Since then, various car and motorcycle championships have  held events at the track, including the Spanish Superbike Championship ESBK. Quotes ahead of the Navarra round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “We’re already really looking forward to the race weekend at  Navarra. We got an initial impression of the track during testing in  June. It’s rather untypical of Superbike tracks, and first gear is  needed in several places. Now we need to see what awaits us there –  also in terms of the temperatures in August. We can use the  information and base set-up from testing to prepare the BMW M 1000 RR  for Superpole and the races. We confirmed our good race pace at Most,  and the goal is to convert this into corresponding results at Navarra  so we need to be strong in Superpole to get a good start position for  the races. I’d like to take this opportunity to congratulate the new  parents Michael and Nadieh – and welcome to the world Mason van der Mark!” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We finished Most in a reasonably strong situation. We can  still see the progression of the BMW M 1000 RR. We already had a test  at Navarra and we feel we have a good base setting. It has been a busy  time for our riders since Most – congratulations to Michael and Nadieh  on the birth of their first baby boy, Mason! Also last week, we tested  with Tom at Barcelona which gave him a good, positive outcome. So all  in all, we have got a lot of things to look forward to going to  Navarra. The team can start FP1 in a strong position and hopefully we  can carry on the progression and aim towards the podium.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I’m looking  forward to keeping the momentum going, with the races now coming quite  fast. So we aim to build on what we understood when we were testing in  Navarra some weeks ago – and also recently on the back of a test at  Barcelona which was in very hot conditions. Obviously, it looks like  Navarra will be warm. It’s a new circuit again for everybody so it  will be interesting to see how the weekend goes, but ultimately the  plan is to continue working with what we found in testing with the BMW  M 1000 RR and hopefully we can transfer that kind of set-up into the  hot track at Navarra and keep improving our results all of the time. I  also want to take this opportunity to say massive congratulations to  Michael and Nadieh on their fabulous new addition to the family, their  little baby boy. That’s a massive achievement in life and I wish them  all the best.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  has been an exciting time since I returned from Most. On Thursday  evening after the race weekend, Mason was born and it is great be able  to spend some days with the family before heading to the next round.  Now we will race at Navarra, and it is always good to have a new track  on the calendar. We have been testing there and it is quite different  compared to other tracks. It is really narrow and overtaking can be  hard. It’s good that we have done a test there, even if our bike has  changed quite a lot since then, so I am curious to find out how it  will work. The first goal for the weekend is to qualify a little bit  better. In Most I was a bit unlucky in qualifying with some traffic, I  must say, but we’ve seen that for example on Saturday and Sunday we  made a huge improvement on lap times and also pace-wise so it seems  that we really found a good way with the set-up of the bike. Hopefully  we will find that right set-up at Navarra pretty soon so we are right  at the point from the start.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “We got to know the  Navarra track during the two-day test in June. It’s not an easy track  and it will be a challenge, but we will give it our all, and I hope  that we can improve and find our way to the front. The most important  goal for us all is to bring home points this weekend.”  Track Facts Navarra*.Circuit        length3.933          km – clockwiseCorners15 – 9 right-handers, 6 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight630          metres (start-finish straight)Grip levelMediumTrack        layoutVery          narrow (slow corners), a bit bumpy surface, changes in elevationStrain on        brakesLower averageAmount at full        throttleAprrox. 18,4 % respectively 18 secondsTop speed / lowest        speed55          km/h / 295 km/hBest overtaking        opportunityEnd of the back straightKey        factorsStability on bumps, power management when          accelerating from the slow corners, agility *Information based on testing ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Starting signal for the CO2-free mobility of the future: Visitors can experience BMW iX5 Hydrogen in action for the first time at IAA Mobility 2021.; Hydrogen fuel cell drive train delivers sustainable driving pleasure as new element of BMW i brand.  Worldwide-unique combination of high-performance fuel cell and optimised power battery underlines BMW Group's leading drive system expertise.  Small series for demonstration and testing purposes to be  launched in 2022.  ;Munich. The BMW Group is systematically pushing  forward with development of hydrogen fuel cell technology as an  additional option for sustainable individual mobility. Two years after  unveiling the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT concept car, the company will  present the BMW iX5 Hydrogen at the IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich.  Currently still in series development, the Sports Activity Vehicle  (SAV) with hydrogen fuel cell drive train will be one of several  vehicles visitors can experience as they are driven along the Blue  Lane connecting the main exhibition grounds with other exhibition  venues in the city centre.A small series of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen, developed on the basis of the  BMW X5, will be used for demonstration and testing purposes from the  end of next year. Its hydrogen fuel cell system is further proof of  the BMW Group’s leading development expertise in the field of electric  drive technologies. “With its high-performance fuel cell and    optimised power battery, the BMW iX5 Hydrogen’s drive system is    unique in the world,” said Juergen Guldner, head of BMW  Group Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology and Vehicle Projects. “With this,  we are forging new paths for sustainable driving pleasure.”With the right conditions, hydrogen fuel cell technology has the  potential to become a further pillar in the BMW Group’s drive train  portfolio for local CO2-free mobility. The BMW i brand, which is  entirely geared towards locally emission-free mobility, could in the  future also offer vehicles with hydrogen fuel cell drive trains, in  addition to battery-electric models such as the BMW i3, BMW iX3, BMW  iX and BMW i4. Provided the hydrogen is produced using renewable  energy and the necessary infrastructure is available, this technology  can complement the BMW Group’s electrified drive train portfolio –  and, in particular, meet the needs of customers who do not have their  own access to electric charging infrastructure, frequently drive long  distances or desire a high degree of flexibility.Model-specific design elements 3D-printed for locally    emission-free Sports Activity Vehicle. The BMW iX5  Hydrogen is a modern luxury Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) that  combines ground-breaking drive technology with the powerful  proportions, convenience and versatility of a BMW X model.    Individual exterior and interior design elements  highlight the car’s ties to the BMW i brand, as well as its specific  drive technology. The inner edging of the BMW kidney grille, the  inserts in the 22- inch aerodynamic wheels and the attachments in the  outer portion of the rear apron are all in BMW i Blue. The entry sills  and cover trim for the instrument panel also sport a “hydrogen fuel  cell” badge.The mesh inserts covering the cooling air openings at the front of  the BMW iX5 Hydrogen, as well as the rear apron and its diffuser  element, also have their own unique design. The ornamental grilles  covering the BMW kidney grille, the lower and two outer air inlets and  the body elements for the lower rear end trim all come from the BMW  Group’s Additive Manufacturing Campus, which uses 3D printing to  produce prototype and standard parts. Additive manufacturing enables  fast and highly flexible production of components – some of which have  geometric shapes that cannot be realised with conventional production methods.Systematic sustainability: Aerodynamic wheels and tyres made    of natural rubber.The BMW iX5 Hydrogen’s aerodynamic wheels come with sustainably  produced tyres made of natural rubber and rayon. The raw materials for  this are extracted in compliance with the standards of the independent  Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) organisation. The BMW Group is the  first automotive manufacturer worldwide to use Pirelli tyres made  exclusively from certified natural rubber and the wood-based material  rayon in its production vehicles.Hallmark BMW driving dynamics, strong long-distance capabilities.The BMW iX5 Hydrogen combines fuel cell technology with a  fifth-generation BMW eDrive. The drive system uses hydrogen as fuel by  converting it into electricity in a fuel cell – delivering an  electrical output of up to 125 kW/170 hp, with water vapour as the  only emission. This drive power also enables it to maintain    consistently high speeds over longer distances. The  electric motor was developed from the fifth-generation BMW eDrive  technology also used in the BMW iX. In coasting overrun and braking  phases, it serves as a generator, feeding energy into a power battery.  The energy stored in this power battery is also utilised for  particularly sporty driving manoeuvres – delivering a system    output of 275 kW/374 hp and guaranteeing the brand's  signature driving experience.The hydrogen needed to supply the fuel cell is stored in two 700-bar  tanks made of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), which together  hold almost six kilograms of hydrogen. “Filling up the    hydrogen tanks only takes three to four minutes – so there  are no limits on using the BMW iX5 Hydrogen for long distances, with  just a few, short stops in-between,” explains Guldner.Hydrogen as part of global activities for CO2-free  mobility. According to a report by the International  Energy Agency (IEA), hydrogen offers considerable potential as    a future energy source in connection with global energy  transition activities. Thanks to its storage and transport  capabilities, hydrogen can be used for a wide variety of applications.  Most industrialised countries are therefore adopting hydrogen  strategies and backing them up with roadmaps and concrete projects. In  the transport sector, hydrogen can become a further technology option,  alongside battery-electric mobility, for shaping sustainable  individual mobility in the long term. However, this will depend on  competitive production of sufficient quantities of hydrogen from green  power, as well as expansion of the corresponding filling  infrastructure, which is already being intensively pursued in many countries.The BMW Group welcomes and supports activities to promote innovation  in Germany and Europe that will help build a hydrogen economy and  accelerate production of green hydrogen. These specifically include  the large-scale hydrogen projects classified as Important Projects of  Common European Interest (IPCEI). The projects that comprise this  European Union initiative, supported in Germany by the Federal  Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Federal Ministry of Transport,  span the entire value chain – from hydrogen production to transport to  applications in industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Dramatic world championship finale in Berlin: Jake Dennis ends farewell season for BMW i Andretti Motorsport in Formula E with third place in the drivers’ standings.;The world title was within touching distance, but luck deserted Jake Dennis (GBR) during the farewell race for BMW in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. Despite retiring from the season finale at the BMW i Berlin E-Prix presented by CBMM Niobium (GER), he completed his rookie season in Formula E with an outstanding third position in the drivers’ standings. ;Berlin. The world title was within touching distance, but luck    deserted Jake Dennis (GBR) during the farewell race for BMW in the    ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. Despite retiring from the    season finale at the BMW i Berlin E-Prix presented by CBMM Niobium    (GER), he completed his rookie season in Formula E with an    outstanding third position in the drivers’ standings. BMW i Andretti    Motorsport finishes the season in sixth place in the team    championship. This race marks the end of BMW’s works involvement in    Formula E after recording seven race wins in three years as a works    team and seven years as Official Vehicle Partner. The home race in    Berlin provided BMW Group with a stage to demonstrate the current    range of fully-electric production vehicles whose drivetrains    benefited significantly from the knowledge gained in the competitive    environment of Formula E. Jake Dennis started the 15th race of the season from ninth on the  grid, just four points off the lead in the overall standings. The race  was quickly over for two of his title rivals after a collision between  Mitch Evans (NZL, Jaguar) and Edoardo Mortara (SUI, Venturi). That put  Dennis in a promising position for the restart, only for a jammed rear  axle to put paid to his world title ambitions as he slid into the wall  and was forced to retire. Nyck de Vries (NED, Mercedes) went on to  secure the title but Dennis was still able to finish third in the  drivers’ championship with 91 points despite his retirement – an  outstanding performance in his rookie Formula E season. Maximilian Günther (GER) was 18th place in qualifying and a bold race  strategy was not enough for a points finish. He finished 15th, ending  the season in 16th position in the overall standings. BMW i Andretti  Motorsport completed its final season as a BMW works team in sixth  place in the team championship with 157 points. Reactions to Race 15 in Berlin. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“We came into this final race with a really good chance of winning  the World Championship with Jake. Practice sessions went not quite as  smoothly as yesterday and in qualifying he again just missed Super  Pole by a few hundredths of a second. Still, he was in a good position  having most of his title contenders behind him. Then at the restart  after the unfortunate collision between Mitch Evans and Edoardo  Mortara we suspect a technical issue with Jakes car that we yet have  to analyse. The rear axle locked and Jake was just a passenger. At  that point his championship hopes were over, but I told him: ‘You must  have had a pretty good season if you are disappointed with third place  in the championship’. If someone had offered that position to us after  the first two rounds, we would have bitten his hand off. Jake did an  amazing job in his rookie season with his two race wins. Maximilian  went in the wrong direction with his setup and didn’t really have a  competitive car in this race unfortunately. Today we are disappointed,  but once all has settled in, I think we can be very proud of what we  have achieved together as BMW and Andretti Formula E and of the hard  work that everyone has put into it to get us to this point. Of course  we would have loved to continue like this but it is not to be. We are  excited what Season 8 swill bring for us. I say thank you to  everybody, not only the team on the front line but also everybody in  the background who helped to make this project a success. Thank you  very much!” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 8th    place, race result: 5th place, points: 91, driver    standings: 3rd place):“It’s a shame that the title fight ended like this – not only for me  but for Mitch Evans and Edoardo Mortara as well. Three title  contenders out of the race early. It felt like there was a technical  failure at the rear, but I don’t know yet what exactly happened. The  rear tyres complete locked before I even had a chance to do anything.  It’s a sad end, but nevertheless we had an incredible season and a  want to thank everybody for working so hard and giving me the chance  to fight for the world championship.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    18th place, race result: 15th place, points:    66, driver standings: 16th place):“Starting from 18th, our aim was of course to make up as much ground  as possible. We went for a bold strategy but unfortunately that did  not pay off. I made some progress at the start and had a few good  fights but we noticed early on that the level of grip wasn’t quite  there, and that we were a bit off the pace. I gave it my all at the  end but a points finish was just out range, sadly. I would have liked  to have managed that to finish the season. Many thanks to BMW for some  great times in Formula E. It was an honour for me to be part of it for  two years. We enjoyed many great moments together as BMW i Andretti  Motorsport and I will never forget them.” Summary: BMW i Andretti Motorsport in Formula E.BMW i Andretti Motorsport competed as a works team for the first time  in Season 5 – and made a perfect start. António Félix da Costa (POR)  claimed pole position and the win as the BMW iFE.18 debuted in Diriyah  (KSA). Alexander Sims (GBR) also gave the team a perfect start to  Season 6 in the same location, recording two pole positions and a win  in the BMW iFE.20. Maximilian Günther (GER) then gave two triumphant  performances in Santiago (CHI) and at the home race in Berlin. Season  7 saw Günther claim his third win for BMW i Andretti Motorsport in the  BMW iFE.21 in New York City (USA). Jake Dennis topped the podium twice  in his Formula E rookie season, at Valencia (ESP) and at his home race  in London (GBR). In three seasons together, BMW i and Andretti  Autosport celebrated a total of seven wins, five pole positions and  twelve podiums. Lessons Learned: Formula E as TechLab for BMW i production drivetrains.After seven years as ‘Official Vehicle Partner’ for Formula E and  three seasons of works team racing, the BMW Group is withdrawing from  the race series. The farewell appearance included a look at the BMW  iX, the BMW i4, the MINI Cooper SE (energy consumption in kWh/100 km  combined (NEDC): 14.9 - 16.9 kWh/100km, combined CO2  emissions (NEDC): 0 g/km) and the BMW CE 04 Scooter, which are  spearheading the current range of fully-electric vehicles. From the word go, the driving force behind the involvement of BMW i  and BMW Motorsport in Formula E was the development of innovative  technologies in the area of electromobility, which are also relevant  for series production. Most of the opportunities for technology  transfer between motor racing and production have largely been  exhausted. An enormous amount of knowledge gained has been included in  the fifth generation of E-drivetrains, which are already on the road  in the BMW iX3 (energy consumption in kWh/100 km: 17.8-17.5 (NEDC);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Jake Dennis still in with a chance of claiming world title after finishing fifth in Saturday’s race in Berlin.;The season finale in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is set to be a thriller – with Jake Dennis (GBR) playing a leading role.

He is just four points away from first place in the battle for the world title.;Berlin. The season finale in the ABB FIA Formula E World    Championship is set to be a thriller – with Jake Dennis (GBR)    playing a leading role. The BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver    finished fifth in Saturday’s race at the BMW i Berlin E-Prix    presented by CBMM Niobium (GER), moving up to third in the drivers’    standings. He is just four points away from first place in the    battle for the world title. Maximilian Günther (GER) crossed the    line in eighth place to score more crucial points for the team    championship. BMW i Andretti Motorsport is in sixth position with    157 points, just 14 points behind the leader.  Dennis had dominated both practice sessions on Friday afternoon and  Saturday morning, recording the best time in each. He did not manage  to reach Super Pole from group one in qualifying, but claimed eighth  place on the grid and a good start position. Günther began the race in  tenth place. Both BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers dropped back a bit at the  start, before working their way back into the points with some  efficient driving and smart use of Attack Mode. Dennis was battling  for third place right to the end and was delighted to have finished  fifth, scoring ten points. Victory went to Lucas di Grassi (BRA, Audi). The 15th and final race of the season is on Sunday at the same  location. It will take place on the reversed Berlin-Tempelhof circuit  and starts at 15:30 CEST. Reactions to Race 14 in Berlin. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“The Berlin event started really well for us with Jake showing very  strong pace in both practice sessions. Unfortunately he got caught up  a little bit on his flying qualifying lap, which cost him one and a  half tenths and a place in the Super Pole shootout. Still we had solid  start positions with both drivers. We hung in there in the race, made  clever use of energy, tyres and Attack Mode. Both drivers made good  passes when they needed to and defended well when they needed to. The  outcome for Jake is third place in the championship. He has everything  to play for tomorrow. Maximilian scored important points for the team.  Looking at how close it is in the standings, I’m really excited for  tomorrow and confident we can have a strong finish to the season.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 8th    place, race result: 5th place, points: 91, driver    standings: 3rd place):“My aim before the race was to finish fifth but then we had a really  bad start and lost some positions. After that we came back strong and  the car behaved very well. At the end we didn’t quite have the pace  anymore to fight for the podium to be honest. Being a rookie entering  the final race of the season just four points behind the leader sounds  really good. To be fair it’s just incredible. I’m so proud if what we  have done here at BMW i Andretti Motorsport. I’ll just enjoy the race  tomorrow and have no pressure. If I fail, we still had an amazing  season together. If I do good, I might win the championship. I’m excited.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    10th place, race result: 8th place, points:    66, driver standings: 14th place):“Unfortunately, I damaged the nose of my car in the first corner  after the start which made me lose some ground. However, we got our  race set up well and had energy and tyre wear under control. In the  end, eighth place was the best we could have achieved I think. Getting  both cars into the points was very important for the team. Everything  is possible tomorrow and I am sure it will be a great day for us.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

This custom-made one-off car is a product of the collaboration between MINI and Paul Smith announced in November 2020, which has resulted in these two iconic British brands sharing creative thoughts on sustainable design for the past few months.;Munich/London. The MINI STRIP (co-)created by Paul  Smith is celebrating its world premiere in London on 12 August 2021.  This custom-made one-off car is a product of the collaboration between  MINI and Paul Smith announced in November 2020, which has resulted in  these two iconic British brands sharing creative thoughts on  sustainable design for the past few months. The MINI STRIP shines the  spotlight on an innovative approach to the issue of sustainability in  automotive manufacturing. Guided by the overarching theme of  ‘Simplicity, Transparency, Sustainability’, the car showcases  inspirational ideas for a more sustainable method of automotive  design. As the name suggests, the process began by completely  stripping down a three-door MINI Cooper SE and reducing it to its  structural essence. Only those elements that the designer viewed as  absolutely necessary were then defined, implemented and put in place –  with sustainability taking a front seat.“For me, the MINI STRIP shows in an impressive way that MINI and Paul  Smith share the same bold way of thinking about the future in terms of  innovation and design - and together we create more. Paul asked  essential questions right at the start of the design process with his  non-automotive and therefore fresh perspective. We are proud to have  developed such a strong character statement together.“ explains Oliver  Heilmer, Head of MINI Design.An outside perspective provides an important source of  inspiration.MINI has always been receptive to views  from beyond its universe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Calder Foundation and BMW are  pleased to announce the presentation of the Calder BMW Art Car    (Artist’s Proof) for the opening day of “Alexander Calder:  Minimal / Maximal” at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin on August 22,  2021. Conceived by BMW Group Classic for the Calder Foundation, the  Artist’s Proof realizes Calder’s dream of creating his own example of  the first BMW Art Car, operating as the kinetic work of art that the  artist intended.Alexander S. C. Rower, grandson of the artist and president of the  Calder Foundation, recalls, “I first encountered the BMW Art Car as a  kid at the opening of my grandfather’s far-ranging retrospective at  the Whitney Museum in 1976. I asked him about the roar of its M49  engine, and he smiled and told me he wanted to make one for himself.  He died just a few weeks later. Ever since, I have dreamed of  realizing his wish to bring the car to life to experience its full  glory in motion. I am thrilled that that day has finally come, and  that the car will be activated for the opening of the Neue  Nationalgalerie’s ‘Minimal / Maximal’ exhibition, which highlights the  key element of social activation so fundamental to Calder’s work.”It is important to note that the Artist’s Proof is not a replica,  clone, copy, reproduction, facsimile, or 1:1 of the 1975 Calder BMW  Art Car. Rather, it is the identical Artist’s Proof that Calder was  entitled to but was never realized until now. Meticulously built from  an original BMW 3.0 CSL, the Artist’s Proof will carry the same  Vehicle Identification Number, with the suffix “AP” (227592/AP).The story behind Calder’s legendary BMW Art Car originated not in the  automotive but rather the aeronautical sphere. In 1974, French  auctioneer and racecar driver Hervé Poulain visited Calder at his  studio in Saché, France, to propose translating the artist’s recent  collaboration with Braniff International Airways into the world of  cars;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On Sunday he first put the  BMW M6 GT3 of Walkenhorst Motorsport in pole position with a lap time  of 1:26.687 minutes. He was able to defend that position at the start  and bring it home after a race distance of 39 laps. This was the  Walkenhorst Motorsport team’s first victory in the race series in only  their sixth race in their maiden season. “The whole weekend went really well for us,” said Wittmann. “We never  expected that we would be so strong in the run-up but the package has  been brill since Friday. Pole was the key today. And the team can be  really proud, it’s only their sixth DTM race and lots is new to them,  like the fast pit stops. They did a fantastic job and didn’t make any mistakes.” Wittmann took the chequered flag in P5 on Saturday and has finished  in the points in all six races of the season to date. Consequently, he  is in fourth place in the driver’s standings with 67 points. Sheldon  van der Linde (RSA) also finished in the points at Zolder. He crossed  the finish line in seventh place on Sunday in the BMW M6 GT3 of ROWE  Racing.

This sees Turner Motorsport lead both championships. The  IMSA was in action on the iconic racetrack at Elkhart Lake (USA) from  6th to 8th August. The IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge race was held on Saturday. The #95  BMW M4 GT4 of Bill Auberlen and Dillon Machavern (both USA) started  from pole position. Machavern led for much of the race before handing  the wheel over to Auberlen. The seasoned driver faced two challenges  in his stint. Firstly, it started pouring with rain, and secondly, he  had to be economical with fuel to reach the finish line without  pitting again. Auberlen mastered both superbly once again which saw  him and Machavern celebrate their second win of the season and  maintain the sole lead in the GS class. Their team-mates Robby Foley  and Vincent Barletta (both USA) finished in fourth place in the #96  BMW M4 GT4 and moved up into second place in the championship standings. Then on Sunday, Turner Motorsport contested the GTD class of the IMSA  WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with the #96 BMW M6 GT3, with  Auberlen and Foley at the wheel. They finished the race lasting 2  hours and 40 minutes in second on the podium, with another clever  strategy. This saw Auberlen and Foley reclaim the overall lead in the  GTD class. --24h Spa: Boutsen Ginion Racing’s personal victory at their    home event.Sunday, 16:30 in Spa-Francorchamps (BEL): After 24 hours, the #10 BMW  M6 GT3 of Boutsen Ginion Racing crossed the finish line in the iconic  endurance race in the Ardennes. For the Belgian BMW M Motorsport team,  making it to the finish at their home event was something of a  personal victory. The team with its drivers Jens Klingmann  (GER), Karim Ojjeh (KSA), Jens Liebhauser (GER) and Yann Zimmer (SUI)  overcame every challenge at the 24h of Spa-Francorchamps.  In the opening phase, characterised by a long full course yellow  phase followed by heavy rain, the #10 BMW M6 GT3 of Boutsen Ginion  Racing was inspiring as it courageously battled its way up the field.  Starting from 45th on the grid, it ploughed its way up through the  field. BMW works driver Klingmann got the car up into 25th place – and  took the lead in the Pro Am class. “We had a very good pace in the  race,” said Klingmann. “We showed that we are definitely capable of  being up there with the Pro frontrunners with our Pro Am car. That’s  also a good sign for the remaining races of the season.” But 24-hour races play by their own rules. Like many other teams,  Boutsen Ginion Racing were not spared from technical issues, which  required long pit stops. But the team kept on battling, and after 24  hours crossed the finish line in 11th place in the Pro Am class and  35th place overall. “Obviously it was a shame that the technical pit stops caused us to  drop right down the field, but we gave it our all to make it to the  chequered flag for us and for BMW,” said Klingmann. “It goes without  saying that the overall result wasn’t what we had hoped for, but I  have to say that I had a lot of fun in the car. Spa is a really  demanding racetrack, and I think that you can enjoy every single lap.  I’m also grateful that our BMW M6 GT3 showed what it’s capable of once  again, even if that wasn’t quite reflected in the position. We’re  feeling positive going into the final two endurance races in the GT  World Challenge and hopefully we will be able to give the BMW M6 GT3 a  fitting send-off in this series as well.” On the first weekend in  September, Boutsen Ginion Racing will take to the grid at the  Nürburgring (GER) with the #10 BMW M6 GT3 to contest the FANATEC GT  World Challenge Europe powered by AWS Endurance Cup, the season finale  will be held in Barcelona from 8th to 10th October. --GT4 European Series: Cem Bölükbasi with two Am Cup wins in the Ardennes.The GT4 European Series race weekend at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) was  extremely successful for Cem Bölükbasi (TUR) and his team Borusan  Otomotiv Motorsport. The fourth event of the season was held from 27th  to 31st July as part of the 24-hour race weekend – and Bölükbasi won  the Am Cup class in both races with the #12 BMW M4 GT4. He finished in  sixth place overall in race one on Friday and won in the Am Cup with a  lead of 28 seconds over the second-placed car in that class. In race  two on Saturday morning, Bölükbasi wowed with a sensational recovery  race. From the 19th row on the grid, he really ploughed his way  through the field with the BMW M4 GT4. Half-way through the race he  was even in fifth place overall. He went on to lose positions as the  race went on, but in P11 in the overall rankings he was once again the  clear winner in the Am Cup, with a lead of almost 25 seconds over the  second-placed car in that class. --British GT Championship: Leader Century Motorsport finishes on    the podium twice at Snetterton.Century Motorsport continues to be successful in the British GT  Championship. The fifth event of the season was held in Snetterton  (GBR) last weekend, and the team secured second place on the podium in  both races. In race one, Gus Burton and Will Burns (both GBR) in the #57 BMW M4  GT4 finished in second place. Their team-mates Andrew  Gordon-Colebrooke and Chris Salkeld (both GBR) retired in the #9 BMW  M4 GT4. Then, in race two it was the Gordon-Colebrooke/Salkeld pairing  who secured second place. Burton and Burns finished fifth.

Burton/Burns also lead the  Silver classification. In the GT4 team standings, Century Motorsport  remains unchallenged at the top, with 242.5 points and a lead of 117. --GT America: Stephen Cameron Racing on the podium at the ‘Music    City Grand Prix’.‘Music City Grand Prix’ – that was the melodious name of the fourth  round of the GT America season held in Nashville (USA) last weekend.  The race took place on a temporary street circuit. On Saturday, in the  first of the two races, the BMW M4 GT4 finished on the podium. Sean  Quinlan (USA) finished third in the GT4 class in car number 119 of  Stephen Cameron Racing. Right behind him was Mark Brummond (USA) in  the #11 BMW M4 GT4 of Classic BMW in fourth. In race two on Sunday,  Quinlan only just missed out on another spot on the podium, finishing  in fourth. --TC France: Top three spots for the BMW M2 CS Racing at Spa-Francorchamps. As part of the 24-hour weekend in Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), the TC  France, the ‘Championnat de France FFSA Tourisme’, also held an event  at the iconic Belgian track from 29th to 31st July. The BMW M2 CS  Racing dominated the first race on Friday evening, taking all top  three spots. Ricardo van der Ende (NED / #16) of L’Espace Bienvenue  won with a lead of 0.5 seconds over his team-mate Benjamin Lessennes  (FRA / #17). Third place went to Steven Palette (FRA) in the #18 BMW  M2 CS Racing of VSF Sports – Amplitude Automobile. In race two on  Saturday morning, Palette in P3 finished on the podium again, van der  Ende and Lessennes finished fourth and fifth. --BTCC: Three podiums at Oulton Park.The British Touring Car Championship held its fourth round of the  season at Oulton Park (GBR) on 31st July and 1st August. On a  turbulent race Sunday, on which two of the three races had to be  red-flagged, the BMW drivers secured three podiums. Independent driver  Andrew Morgan finished in third place with the #33 BMW 330i M Sport of  Ciceley Motorsport in both race one and two.

BMW Motorrad Motorsport ends Most debut in WorldSBK with a solid Sunday of racing.;The Autodrom Most debut in the FIM Superbike World Championship ended with a solid day of racing for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. In the Superpole race on Sunday morning, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished fifth and eleventh. In the afternoon’s second race, van der Mark climbed ten places to finish as the best-placed BMW rider in seventh. Sykes came home in ninth place.;Most. The Autodrom Most debut in the FIM Superbike World    Championship ended with a solid day of racing for BMW Motorrad    Motorsport. In the Superpole race on Sunday morning, Tom Sykes (GBR)    and Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team    finished fifth and eleventh. In the afternoon’s second race, van der    Mark climbed ten places to finish as the best-placed BMW rider in    seventh. Sykes came home in ninth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from BMW    Team Bonovo MGM Racing narrowly missed out on the points in race    two, finishing 16th. First on Sunday morning was the Superpole race, which Sykes started  from fourth place. He lost one position in the turmoil at the start,  before holding onto fifth place right through to the finish after ten  laps of racing. Van der Mark climbed into eleventh place from 17th on  the grid. Folger was 18th, having started 21st. Van der Mark gave another eye-catching performance in race two on  Sunday afternoon, gaining ten positions with an impressive fightback.  Having started 17th, he crossed the finish line 22 laps later in  seventh place, just half a second outside the top five. After the  start, van der Mark had to take evasive measures to avoid a multi-bike  crash, before launching his assault on the front of the field. By lap  three he had reached the top ten. After seven laps, he was running  ninth. The Dutchman climbed into seventh place on lap 17. Team-mate  Sykes spent the majority of the race in the top six, but then fell  back a few positions to ninth in the final third of the race. Folger,  who again started from 21st place, raced into 17th place on the  opening lap. He then continued to make progress into 16th place and  eventually crossed the finish line in that position, just 0.210  seconds outside the points. Quotes after race two at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “I  think we can be pleased with the results today. Tom had a very good  Superpole race and didn’t have to go straight on at T1 so he could  stick in his fifth position and brought it home very well. Michael had  a good catch up all the from 17th, but the first lap was difficult and  he lost nearly five seconds to the front runners in the first lap. He  finished one second off P9 which would have given us ninth position on  the grid, but it was not meant to be so we started 17th again with  Mickey for the feature race. In race two, Michael confirmed his very  good pace and to come all the way from 17th to seventh is pleasing,  although this confirms that you need to start in those first three  rows. With Tom, we will have to see which issues he had. He was still  quite close in the group but couldn’t hold his position and dropped  down to ninth. Jonas had another difficult day so we will have to  investigate what is going on there, but he doesn’t have his mojo at  the moment. Overall, it was nice to be in Most, and to have the fans  back with us. It is a nice track layout however with some safety  points to be raised for next year.”  Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “The Superpole race gave us everything we had hoped, all but  the fact we didn’t quite get that ninth position that Michael needed  to give him an increased grid position. Tom made a really good job on  the ‘X’ tyre and did well to finish fifth. It was a real shame for  Mickey;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Motorrad Motorsport on Saturday at Most: Strong Superpole, good pace, disappointing race result.;Saturday in the Czech city of Most began with a strong Superpole result for BMW Motorrad Motorsport but ended with a disappointing race result. The FIM Superbike World Championship is making its first appearance at Most, where it is staging round six of the 2021 season.;Most. Saturday in the Czech city of Most began with a strong    Superpole result for BMW Motorrad Motorsport but ended with a    disappointing race result. The FIM Superbike World Championship is    making its first appearance at Most, where it is staging round six    of the 2021 season. In Superpole, Tom Sykes (GBR) of the BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished fourth on his BMW M 1000 RR,    narrowly missing out on the front row of the grid. He then came home    ninth in race one. Sykes’ team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) made    an impressive fightback in the race before crashing out. Jonas    Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team retired with a    technical issue. Sykes came up just 0.015 seconds short of a place on the front row of  the grid in Saturday morning’s Superpole qualifying. However, fourth  place also put him in a good position going into the race. Van der  Mark had to settle for 17th place in Superpole. Folger, who had  crashed in the morning’s third free practice session, qualified 21st. Sykes climbed into third place at the start of race one. However, he  went wide in turn one while having to avoid other riders and slotted  back into fifth place. On lap five, he again headed straight on in  turn one when he was touched by another bike. Finding himself in tenth  place, Sykes attempted to work his way back to the front of the field,  but then had issues with the rear tyre. He ultimately crossed the  finish line in ninth place. Starting from 17th on the grid, van der Mark launched a spirited  comeback on his M RR. However, having climbed into eighth place, that  comeback came to an abrupt end. The Dutchman was one of several riders  who crashed out of Saturday’s race. Folger had been continuously  moving up the field towards a points finish until a technical issue  forced him to retire on lap seven. Quotes after race one at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  outcome of the race has been disappointing. In Superpole, Tom gave a  strong performance, he was right up there, and his race simulations  looked good in practice. During the race, he had to abort at T1 twice  going straight on, so he lost several positions throughout. Mickey had  a very disappointing qualifying but, in the race, made up in the early  stages as he usually does. He had good pace during the race and was  catching the P6, P7 group in front of him which would have been a good  result to come home with, but he unfortunately crashed. So we take the  positive point from today that the pace from Michael was there, but if  you don’t bring it home you get no points, so it was disappointing  overall. Jonas unfortunately retired due to an engine failure, so we  have to look into the cause. Now we hope for a better day tomorrow.”  Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We always aim for the first two rows as it’s a great  position to be in and Tom did just that in Superpole. In the race, Tom  got pushed wide going into the first corner and reacted quickly not to  lose many positions and time. The SC0 was the tyre of choice for the  race and he got into a pretty lonely battle at the end of the day so  he will equally be disappointed to finish 26 seconds off the win.  Michael had a difficult qualifying session but come the race he did  true Michael van der Mark style to battle and come through into a good  position. He was doing lap times in that race he hasn’t found all  weekend, so I am more pleased he was able to find that comfortable  feeling and his confidence ahead of tomorrow. Unfortunately, he  crashed at T20 which is easy to do with the temperatures increasing.  But we are not totally disappointed, we will come back stronger  tomorrow as we gained a lot of information.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The  qualifying result for sure was nice. When we put the Q tyre into the  BMW M 1000 RR, I am able to ride the bike much more naturally, and the  bike does things much better. But unfortunately for the race there was  a mix of tyres. We went down the safer route and this certainly did  not help us. After the start, going into T1 I was in there and I’ve  been happy with my braking all weekend, but the guys had stopped, and  I didn’t want to collect anyone, so I took the option to spoil my  first lap. Then the second time somebody was up the inside of me and  touched my handlebar, so I wasn’t able to make the turn. For tomorrow,  we will look to improve the set up, and we will revisit the tyre  choice. Overall, I am a little bit disappointed, also disappointed  with the final race result but we have learnt a lot today. Tomorrow we  will get two more chances.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was a really disappointing day, to be honest. In Superpole, I had bad  traffic on both outings on the Q tyre, which was such bad luck. It’s a  shame as I felt we could really make a step forward, so it was not  easy starting from P17 on the grid. Anyway, in the race I got a good  start and had good pace. I was fighting my way towards the front and  was feeling good with the bike but unfortunately when I was sat in P8  I lost the front going into T20. I was trying hard so it’s a shame  because we lost some valuable points. It was a difficult day overall,  but we can be happy with the pace we had in race one.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I was quick in  yesterday’s first free practice session, but unfortunately I then had  a crash in practice this morning. The mechanics managed to get the  bike ready just in time for qualifying. As a result, I only rode two  laps before we went into Superpole. That was probably why I didn’t  manage a good time. In the race, I noticed when changing gear that  there was a problem with the engine, which unfortunately then failed.  It was a tough day.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Predictive maintenance: When a machine knows in advance that repairs are needed.; Predictive maintenance enhances efficiency and sustaina-bility at the BMW Group  Smart digital monitoring and maintenance prevent unplanned production downtimes  Cloud-based platform integrated into global BMW Group production network ; Predictive maintenance enhances efficiency and sustainability at  the BMW Group  Smart digital monitoring and maintenance prevent  unplanned production downtimes  Cloud-based platform integrated  into global BMW Group production network Munich. When it comes to maintaining  production systems, the solution of choice at the BMW Group is to use  sensors, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). So rather  than the previous approach of rule-based maintenance at regular  intervals, predictive maintenance is carried out, based on the current  condition of the system. This not only prevents unscheduled downtimes  in production but also makes an important contribution to  sustainability and the efficient use of resources by ensuring optimum  system availability. Innovative, cloud-based predictive maintenance  solutions are currently being rolled out across the global production network.Predictive maintenance as an early warning system in production.The increasing digitalisation of maintenance has made a predictive  approach more and more important. By monitoring equipment and status  data, predictive maintenance can forecast system failures before they  actually happen. To optimise the upkeep of systems, data is used to  decide when to replace components as a precaution so as to prevent  unnecessary downtimes. Predictive maintenance also enhances efficiency  and sustainability by ensuring intact components are not exchanged too early.Forecasting states via a cloud-based platform.Predictive maintenance uses a cutting-edge cloud platform to obtain  early warnings about potential production downtimes. The data comes  directly from the manufacturing systems themselves, which are  connected to the cloud only once, via a gateway, for monitoring, and  then constantly transmit data – usually once a second. Individual  software modules within the platform can be switched on and off  flexibly, as needed, to accommodate changing requirements immediately.  And with a high degree of standardisation between its individual  components, the system is globally accessible, highly scalable and  allows new application scenarios to be implemented easily and existing  solutions to be rolled out fast. Predictive maintenance allows maintenance and repair processes to be  carried out as required by the actual condition of the system and  planned into already-scheduled production downtimes. Repairs can be  more accurately targeted and carried out more cost- and  resource-efficiently. In addition, extending running times prolongs  the service life of tools and systems significantly. The guiding  principle behind the provision of this solutions is: Developed once,  rolled out often – across the BMW Group production network.Diverse range of applications. The flexible, highly automated systems in mechanical drivetrain  production manufacture a conventional engine or casing for an electric  motor every minute. To keep these machines in good condition,  predictive maintenance uses simple statistical models – or predictive  AI algorithms, in more complex cases – to detect any anomalies. It  then issues visual warnings and alerts to inform employees that  maintenance is due.Over in the bodyshop, the welding guns perform about 15,000 spotwelds  each per day. To prevent potential downtimes, data from welding guns  around the world is collected by specially developed software. It is  then sent to the cloud to be collated and analysed with the help of  algorithms. All the data is displayed on a dashboard for worldwide use  to support the maintenance processes.In vehicle assembly, predictive maintenance helps prevent downtimes  in conveyors. At BMW Group Plant Regensburg, for example, the control  units of the conveyor systems work 24/7 to send data on points such as  electrical currents, temperatures and locations to the cloud, where it  is constantly evaluated. The data specialists can then identify the  position, condition and activities of every conveyor element at any  given time. Predictive AI models use the data to detect any anomalies  and locate technical problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
New territory for WorldSBK: BMW Motorrad Motorsport ready for the Most debut.;BMW Motorrad Motorsport is once again entering new territory with the FIM Superbike World Championship. This weekend (6th to 8th August), WorldSBK races in the Czech city of Most for the first time.;Munich. BMW Motorrad Motorsport is once again entering new    territory with the FIM Superbike World Championship. This weekend    (6th to 8th August), WorldSBK races in the Czech city of Most for    the first time. Autodrom Most is unfamiliar terrain for the BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team and its two riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and    Michael van der Mark (NED), although Mark has ridden there many    years ago. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing Team has    more recent experience of the circuit. Autodrom Most is located in the northwest of the Czech Republic, not  far from the border with Germany. The Most region has hosted  motorsport events for over 70 years – first on street circuits, before  the permanent racetrack opened in 1983. Since then, races in national  and international championships have been held there. Most features on  the WorldSBK calendar for the first time in 2021. Quotes ahead of the Most round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Most  is a new circuit on the calendar. For this reason, it is very  important to immediately find a good basis in the two free practice  sessions on Friday. Jonas Folger has been there often, and our  colleagues in the International German Motorcycle Championship have  also ridden there. As such, we have some information, but it can never  be transferred directly to World Superbikes. In addition, it had been  agreed that no one goes testing there with their Superbikes so we are  all entering uncharted territory. We will see what awaits us there.  Recent events have shown that you have to land on the front two rows  in Saturday’s Superpole to have a successful race weekend. That is one  of the goals for the weekend.”  Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “The team is looking forward to going to the first WorldSBK  round at the Most circuit. That's exciting for everybody and very much  a level playing field with all the competitors and teams agreeing in  not take part in any testing leading up in the event. Overall, I think  it will be a very challenging circuit, lots of variations. Changeable  weather conditions are expected and we already know that we were  competitive in those environments. But overall, the team hopes that we  end up with a completely dry weekend to continue the development of  the BMW M 1000 RR. I think we are in a very good place, the riders are  feeling very good about the progression of the bike over the last  three, four races and we are looking forward to getting the event underway.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “I’ve been to Most, but that was 13 years ago. I watched an  on-board lap on YouTube and noticed that I have forgotten half of the  track, so it I think one can say that it’s like a new circuit for me.  So in the first couple of laps I will just try to learn the track and  find some markers, braking points and stuff like that. The last couple  of weekends, we saw that we were making progress. The gap to the  podium was getting smaller and smaller. So we now have to try and find  these last couple of tenths, especially on race pace, to be able to  fight for the podium. It is difficult to say what to expect for this  weekend on a new track but this is our goal, for sure.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am  obviously very much looking forward to the new venture. I have been to  the Czech Republic a number of times before but Most is a new circuit  for myself and I believe for most of the WorldSBK paddock. This is  going to be very interesting and hopefully now with our base set-up of  the new BMW M 1000 RR we can have a strong start to the weekend and  look to build on this in preparation for the races even if we only  have a small amount of time on Friday to do so. The weekend will be a  kind of an unpredictable one in terms of results because most of the  teams are going there with zero information. I am looking forward to  this new challenge.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I am really looking  forward to Most after the race weekend in Assen was such a positive  one – apart from the crash. We had really good pace there. We are now  looking to continue at Most where we left off at Assen. The circuit is  not far from me, so I can virtually call it a home race. I hope a lot  of German fans make the trip. I am looking forward to WorldSBK’s debut  at Most. I can hardly wait.”  Track Facts Most*.Circuit        length4.212          km – clockwiseCorners21 – 14 right-handers, 7 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight720          metres (start-finish straight)Grip levelComparatively highTrack        layoutVery          few straights, apart from start/finish;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Statement Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Conference Call Half-Year Report to 30th June 2021;Statement Zipse Conference Call Q2 2021;Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. The performance of BMW is undisputed. As Nicolas Peter told us. We  are on the right track. We are making the right decisions at the right  time: the decisions that will keep our company profitable and  successful for a long time to come. Ladies and Gentlemen,What is the world most concerned with right now? What is our society  striving towards? What is the burning issue that unites us all? There  can be no doubt that it is drastically reducing CO2. We  share the same goal: of effectively combating climate change. That is  where I would like to start today. And from there, I’ll go on to talk  about the following points: How are we further strengthening our digital expertise?Where  does the BMW Group stand in financial year 2021? Let's start with the first point:Our road to climate neutrality. The three main regions of the world, many other countries and even  cities – all want to become carbon neutral. That is also our mission  and responsibility at the BMW Group. We have always taken a  forward-looking perspective. It is the foundation of the long-term  business model our company is built on. It requires, by definition,  that all our decisions are based on sustainable thinking. Our  strategic orientation towards climate neutrality benefits our  customers. At the same time, it also sends a strong signal to all our  stakeholders and the capital market, which is increasingly looking to  invest in sustainability. Not least, it sends a signal to our team and  their jobs! The currency that matters in our industry today: How big  is a vehicle’s carbon footprint throughout the whole of its lifecycle?  The atmosphere – that is, the climate – doesn’t care whether a  manufacturer adopts a BEV-only, BEV-centric or an open-technology  strategy. All that matters for the purposes of climate protection is  the actual amount of CO2 emitted – and that means across  the board: from raw materials and other materials, throughout the  industrial manufacturing process and active use of a vehicle, all the  way to recycling the raw materials. Our impression is that it is often  the case with zero emissions that the louder the proclamations, the  broader the disclaimer and general terms and conditions tend to be. Not with us!Already in summer 2020 we unveiled concrete sustainability goals for  2030 – and geared our company towards them. We are documenting our  progress in a way that is transparent and verifiable for everyone – in  our Integrated Report;"  while other countries in the EU don’t even have a rudimentary charging infrastructure. In the US, California continues to lead the way on e-mobility, but  demand for vehicles with combustion engines remains strong in many  other states. In Asia, countries like Japan and Korea have the potential for fuel  cell drive trains. China is driving the pace on e-mobility. E-fuels could also be an option for certain regions. Going forward, hydrogen technology will become more important,  alongside electric power – and not, as is often rumoured, just for  utility vehicles. This is another area where we are delivering: Our  small series of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT will be released next year. We are often asked whether the BMW Group has a date for its full  transition to pure electric drive trains. The answer, to put it  clearly and precisely, is:We are 100 percent committed to BEVs – wherever the use of  battery-electric drive trains makes sense, and it is possible because  the conditions are right. Our MINI brand is the best proof of this.From the early 2030s, it will be our first all-electric brand –  without any disclaimers. Because MINI fans are mainly active in urban spaces. This is the exact same direction targeted by the new electric scooter  from BMW Motorrad. Our CE 04 is the perfect companion for the urban  commuter. We recently unveiled the production model, which we will  begin delivering early next year. All of this underlines that:Achieving market penetration with e-mobility hasn’t been a vehicle  supply issue for quite a while now. It depends, to a greater degree,  on how quickly charging infrastructure is being expanded. We have been committed to this for a long time: We have already  installed more than 15,000 charging points worldwide. In Germany  alone, we operate one of the biggest company charging networks in  conjunction with E.ON. We currently have a total of 4,350 charging  points in service – by the end of the year, it will be 5,000. All of  them run on green power and some are open to the public. We will provide an update on our progress in the autumn, as part of  IONITY’s European High-Power Charging Network. IONITY is open to  anyone who wants to join. Expansion is important to us. We must not  allow charging infrastructure to be the bottleneck that decides  whether customers buy an electric vehicle or not. As the current ACEA  president, I am fighting for this, so we can move forward faster in  all 27 EU member states. We need a stronger commitment to this. With the Fit for 55 package it unveiled in July, the European  Commission has once again tightened its reduction targets for  CO2 emissions. Every additional percentage point the  targets are tightened means we need at least 200,000 more public  charging points – in addition to the three million already needed by 2030. Companies are now expected to reduce CO2 emissions from  their new vehicle fleets by 55 percent from current levels by 2030.  That is the Commission’s proposal, which forms the starting point for  the legislative process. It is equivalent to tightening the target by  around 18 percentage points from the previous target of minus 37.5  percent. As you would expect from BMW, we are taking a reliable and  consistent approach to this additional challenge. By 2023, we will offer our customers at least one BEV option in  nearly all our vehicle segments. Over the next ten years or so, the  BMW Group aims to release a total of about ten million fully-electric  vehicles onto the market. For the targets up to 2035, a review by the Commission in 2028 will  determine whether credit should be awarded for other zero-emission  technologies, such as e-fuels, in addition to BEVs and FCEVs. In 2025 – just four years from now – we will launch the NEUE KLASSE.  This all-new product offering is our response to the highly complex  requirements of the coming decades. In many respects, the NEUE KLASSE  is a real quantum leap – for future model generations, toolkits,  technologies, cooperation and our mindset across the BMW Group. Our  new vehicle architecture is uncompromisingly electric, whether with  battery power or hydrogen. It also comes with an entirely new IT and software architecture, as  well as a newly-developed high-performance electric drive train and  battery generation. Systems integration is another one of the BMW  Group’s core competences that we will be demonstrating in the NEUE KLASSE. For me, all of this underlines our forward-looking approach. This brings me to my second topic:We are further strengthening our digital expertise. In today's cars, software, hardware and services work together in an  integral way. This is how we are laying the technological foundation  that will enable us to offer our customers new functions on an ongoing  basis. Our vehicles are always up to date with the very latest  technology. For the past few years, we have been able to update every  single line of code in the vehicle over the air via Remote Software  Upgrade. There are only two firms capable of this: One of them is in  California, the other in Munich. By the end of this year, the BMW Group will have over 2.5 million  vehicles with upgrade capabilities on the roads – the largest fleet of  this kind worldwide. Our new generation BMW iDrive leads the interaction between driver  and vehicle into the digital future. We lay the foundation for this  with the new BMW Operating System 8: A new generation of displays,  controls and software, as well as extremely powerful data processing  designed for 5G. We are introducing it for the first time in the BMW  iX and subsequently rolling it out broadly across all other models. We  are also integrating the digital services for navigation, parking and  charging into the BMW Maps cloud-based system. With the iX, customers  also have the flexibility to book “functions on demand” at any time. For the digital ecosystem in the vehicle, as well as digitalised  production and digitalised processes across the company, we are  building up the necessary skills and competencies. Here, we are  concentrating on specific areas:  At the BMW Group, around 10,000 employees are working in the IT and  software development. In the last few years alone, we have brought in  2,400 new experts in our development division. Our 14 tech offices  span the world – from California to the new FIZ Nord in Munich to  Shanghai and Tokyo. In addition, we have joint ventures such as  Critical TechWorks in Portugal. When it comes to in-car IT applications, in particular, customers in  different regions of the world, specifically in China, Europe and the  USA, use different services and providers – that is the diverse  markets I mentioned earlier. For every region, we provide seamless  integration of third-party services, such as Apple, Google, Tencent or Spotify. Let’s wrap up with my third point:To sum up in just a few words: Yes, we had a strong first half    of the year. Our broad range of fresh new models and various drive technologies  met with lively demand. This applies to all our brands, BMW, MINI and  Rolls-Royce, as well as to M GmbH, BMW Motorrad and all regions of the  world. Around 1.34 million vehicles represents growth of almost 40  percent, compared to the first half of 2020. Sales for the first six  months of the year were the highest in our history. But we all know that, in many regions of the world, the first half of  2020 was hit especially hard by the restrictions due to the  coronavirus pandemic. That is why a comparison with the first half of  the pre-crisis year 2019 is more meaningful: Compared to that period,  our sales increased by 7.1 percent. In July this year as well, our  figure was above July 2019. As expected, our customers are buying significantly more electrified  vehicles right now. In the first half of the year our sales grew by  almost 150 percent. In our domestic market of Germany, nearly one in  four BMWs and around 30 percent of MINIs sold already have an electric  drive train. By the end of the year, we aim to have a total of one million  fully-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles on the roads and, by 2025,  two million pure electric vehicles. By then, we aim to deliver ten  times the number of BEVs we sold in 2020. The fully-electric BMW iX3* has been available since the start of  this year. It was not designed specifically for e-mobility. Despite  that, it is winning comparative tests with its rivals. The BMW iX and  i4 will both be launched in the autumn. Both are extraordinary  vehicles that offer a fantastic driving experience. High orders for  both are already exceeding our expectations. The planned annual volume  of the BMW iX, for example, is already largely sold out in Europe.  This underlines the high level of interest in this technologically  unique vehicle. We are naturally very pleased with the positive  feedback in the media and on social media. New models will be coming in rapid succession from here on: In the  next two years, we will launch all-electric versions of the BMW 7  Series, X1 and 5 Series. Ladies and Gentlemen,2021 is proving to be a unique financial year for us, with both  tailwinds and headwinds.On 20 May, we re-evaluated our provision of 1.4 billion euros in  connection with antitrust proceedings by the European Commission. The  Commission completely withdrew its allegations against the BMW Group.  The Commission confirmed once again in this connection that: There is  and was never any allegation of illegal manipulation of exhaust gas  treatment by the BMW Group. The proceedings were concluded on 8 July  with a settlement and a fine of 372.8 million euros.The revaluation of the provision has led to a positive earnings  effect of around one billion euros in the second quarter of 2021. As a  result, our target corridor for the EBIT margin in the Automotive  segment increased by one percentage point. There are, however – on top of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic  – additional risks for our ongoing business performance that we are  taking very seriously. Our industry cannot ignore the global shortage  of microchips. So far – compared to other manufacturers – we have been  able to absorb the impact of this well. A few of our plants have also  been affected recently – but with varying degrees of intensity. We  assess the situation on a daily basis and are taking appropriate  measures with our suppliers. In addition to semiconductor supply bottlenecks, we also face rising  raw material prices. This is another reason why our circular approach  makes sense. Lastly, extreme weather, such as the devastating floods in Germany,  Europe and other parts of the world show: Forecasts and expectations  can change fast – quite apart from the immense suffering people in the  affected regions are facing. Confronted with all these risks, the second half-year will be more  challenging for the BMW Group than the first. Nevertheless, we are  confident that we will achieve our targets for the full year. We are convinced:Our holistic approach is absolutely effective. The requirements for the automotive industry are highly complex.  There are no simple truths. What counts – for climate protection as with all the other major  future fields – is effectiveness. This is what the BMW Group stands for. Thank you!   *Consumption/emissions data: BMW iX3: Power consumption in kWh/100 km combined:  17.8-17.5 NEDC, 19.0-18.6 WL""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Statement Dr Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Conference Call Half-Year Report to 30th June 2021;Statement Dr Peter Conference Call Q2 2021 ;Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning! In the second quarter of 2021, as expected, the BMW Group was able to  build on its strong performance of the first three months. Individual  mobility remains in high demand across the globe. The EBIT margin in  the Automotive Segment for the year to the end of June was 13.0% and,  therefore, at a very healthy level. In a decade of transformation, the BMW Group is taking an active and  formative role. Sustainable profitability lays the foundation for us  to continue investing in future technologies. That is why, during a  strong first half-year, we continued to focus on our performance. The  efficiency measures we launched in recent years are now also bearing fruit. So far, thanks to the hard work of our staff in Purchasing,  Production and Sales, we have been able to make up for the challenges  in semiconductor supplies. But, as the supply bottlenecks drag on, the  situation is becoming more volatile. That is why we anticipate further  disruption to production in the second half of the year and a related  impact on vehicle sales. Ladies and Gentlemen, Let's start with the financial figures for the Group. The recovery  from the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis continued in the  first half of 2021. In the year to the end of June, Group revenues climbed 28.1% to 55.36  billion euros. At 9.74 billion euros, Group earnings before tax for the first six  months were, as expected, significantly higher than the previous year  – which had been heavily impacted by the lockdown. The figure for the  second quarter rose to almost 6 billion euros. Reflecting the positive  business development overall, the Group EBT margin was 17.6% for the  year to the end of June and 20.9% for the second quarter. The revenue  and earnings results largely reflect better pricing, positive effects  from our model mix, as well as higher sales volumes resulting from  increased demand. Both our new vehicles and our pre-owned cars are  proving very popular with customers right now. The significant  improvement in our financial result also boosted Group earnings.Lower risk provisioning and higher income from the resale of  end-of-lease vehicles also contributed to the increase. Having  recognised higher provisions last year, in response to the volatile  situation caused by the pandemic, we were now able to release some of  this amount. In addition to this, as already announced in May,  positive effects came from the partial release of the provision in  connection with the EU antitrust proceedings of around  one-billion-euro, as well as from valuation effects from our pension  obligations. However, these positive effects were offset by headwinds  from higher raw material prices. In recent years, we have implemented long-lasting changes in all  areas of the company that are now paying off. At the same time, we  have taken further important steps to reduce complexity: For instance,  new package solutions for our products have, in particular, made the  digital customer experience much simpler and more enjoyable. They are  also relieving pressure on the cost side. To fully exploit sales potential and improve working capital, we are  constantly optimising our sales structures and using analysis tools to  manage our sales and inventories in an even more granular way, i.e. by  market, model or sales channel. In this way, we always have the  appropriate offer. On the production side, as previously announced, we  will reduce cost per unit by a quarter from 2019 levels by 2025. One  of the ways we will achieve this is by exploiting potential for  optimisation in logistics and capacity utilisation, as well as through  virtual planning processes. Further electrification of our vehicle fleet is the focus of our  short and medium-term planning. The all-electric BMW iX has been  rolling off the production line at our plant in Dingolfing since July.  This will be followed in the autumn by the all-electric BMW i4 from  our main plant in Munich. At over 2.57 billion euros, R&D expenditure for the first six  months remained high. This also includes initial upfront investments  for the Neue Klasse, as well as expenditure for further development of  our electric drive trains and digitalisation of our fleet. As always,  our focus remains on the customer. The R&D ratio for the first  half-year, according to the German Commercial Code, was 4.6%. All our decisions are clearly focused on the main topics of  electrification, sustainability and digitalisation. We are using  available resources intelligently for maximum impact. Capital expenditure is higher than for the same period of last year,  at just under 1.71 billion euros. Investment in the launch of the new  iX and further development of our electric drive trains were key  drivers for this. Higher revenues meant the capex ratio of 3.1% was slightly lower than  the previous year.In the second half of 2021, capital expenditure is forecast to be  higher, due to the number of launches and usual seasonal effects. We  expect the ratio for the full year to be below our target figure of 5%. The financial result increased significantly in the first six months.  The at-equity result once again reflects the strong business  performance of our Chinese joint venture BBA, whose earnings  contribution climbed to one billion euros, thanks to strong customer  demand. Of course, the figure for the previous year had been dampened  by pandemic restrictions, especially in the first quarter. The other financial result benefited from valuation effects for  interest rate derivatives in connection with higher interest rates in  the US. The result from investments also saw further positive  valuation effects from the iVentures fund and SGL Carbon shares. YourNow's digital services have benefited from the Europe-wide easing  of pandemic restrictions in recent months. Demand has risen  significantly. FREE NOW Ridehailing, for example, achieved 140% growth  in taxi and chauffeur rides. SHARE NOW also experienced a strong  upswing in car sharing. Long-term rents increased by 41% in the first  half of 2021 compared to the previous year. Ladies and Gentlemen,Let's now take a look at the individual segments, starting with the  Automotive Segment. Strong demand in the international automotive markets was reflected  in significantly higher revenues – which reached 47.75 billion euros  for the year to the end of June. Revenues for the second quarter  totalled 24.98 billion euros. All regions of the world saw positive  development – especially China and the US. The operating result, EBIT, reached a new all-time high of 6.19  billion euros for the first half-year. The figure for the second  quarter rose to 3.95 billion euros. As well as releasing some of the  provision for the EU antitrust proceedings, as I already mentioned,  lower employee numbers, better pricing and an exceptionally good  situation for residual value development also had a positive effect.  Higher raw material prices, including a sharp increase in rhodium and  palladium costs, dampened earnings development, however. Against this  background, the EBIT margin was 13.0% for the year to the end of June  and 15.8% for the second quarter. The uncertainty over supply chains and additional raw material  headwinds remains high. As a result, earnings momentum is expected to  weaken in the second half of the year. The segment’s financial result for the second quarter benefited from  the strong earnings contribution of almost 500 million euros from our  Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive and positive valuation  effects from equity investments. Let’s take a look at free cash flow in the Automotive Segment.We are taking advantage of the current situation to systematically  optimise our working capital. We are on the right track: Free cash  flow in the Automotive Segment totalled 4.9 billion euros at the end  of June. Good working capital management related to lower inventories  due to the semi-conductor situation and, in particular, higher  earnings, are the driver for this. As is usual, payments for  investments will increase towards year-end. Additionally, earnings  momentum will be dampened by the supply bottlenecks I referred to. In  the second half of the year, we also anticipate cash outflows for  personnel restructuring measures. Tax pre-payments will also be due.  We are aiming for a free cash flow at year-end above our previous  record of 5.8 billion euros. Let’s move on to the Financial Services Segment, which also benefited  from global sales growth and a positive risk situation in the second  quarter and delivered a strong financial performance. A total of 1.03 million new financing and leasing contracts were  concluded with retail customers in the first half of 2021 – an  increase of 28% year-on-year. The total portfolio of 5.6 million  retail contracts was at the same level as at the start of the year.  The very positive development in pre-owned car markets I already  mentioned also continued in the second quarter – especially in the US  and UK. This resulted, in high income from the sale of end-of-lease  vehicles. Credit losses remained at a low level. In the first half of the year, segment earnings before tax increased  to 1.94 billion euros. The figure for the second quarter was 1.15  billion euros. The prior-year quarter had been dominated by  uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic, with additional risk  provisioning for anticipated credit and residual value risks. The Motorcycles Segment also performed well in the second quarter,  with eight new models introduced by the end of June. Thanks to this  strong product offering, we were able to grow sales to 107,000 units  in the first half of the year – a new all-time high for this period.  The segment’s operating earnings rose in line with the positive  business development in the year to the end of June to 284 million  euros. The figure for the second quarter was 149 million euros.The EBIT margin for the first half of the year was 17.5%. Ladies and Gentlemen,Let’s take a look now at our guidance for the current year. The BMW Group continues to focus on profitable, sustainable growth. After a strong first half-year, we generally expect a positive  business development for the full year 2021. Our guidance assumes that  political and economic conditions will not deteriorate significantly.  It also does not take account of the possible further impact of the  coronavirus pandemic. For the full year, based on our current assessments, we expect the  key financial and non-financial performance indicators to develop as follows: We anticipate a significant increase in Group pre-tax earnings for  the full year. Thanks to ongoing personnel restructuring measures, we  intend to achieve our goals with a slightly lower number of employees  than last year. In the Automotive Segment, we should see a solid increase in the  number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles delivered to customers.  Electrified vehicles will account for a significantly higher  percentage of total volumes. We have a strong market position in  China. Demand for cars from our three BMW Group brands remains high in  the US and Europe. However, due to the current uncertainty over  semiconductor supplies, we cannot rule out the possibility of our  sales figures being impacted by further production downtimes.  Continued high raw material prices will have a significant impact in  the second half of 2021. We also expect to see the usual seasonal  increase in fixed costs towards the end of the year. For this reason,  the EBIT margin is forecast to be at the high end of our target range  of 7 to 9%. We will once again significantly reduce CO₂ emissions in  our new vehicle fleet. In the Financial Services Segment, earnings development will benefit  more from the improved situation than originally anticipated – both in  terms of credit and residual value risks. This is reflected in a  higher return on equity than in our original guidance – which we now  expect to be within the range of 17 to 20%.In the Motorcycles Segment, we had so far forecast a solid increase  in deliveries. Now, due to positive market development, it looks like  we will be able to deliver slightly more motorcycles than forecast in  March. We therefore anticipate a significant increase in deliveries,  slightly above the 10% mark. The EBIT margin will remain within our  target range of 8 to 10%. Ladies and Gentlemen, After the first six months of 2021, the BMW Group is on course to  meet its goals for the year. However, the uncertainty surrounding  semiconductor supplies makes planning for the full year difficult. Our  vehicle plants have the capacity and the flexibility to meet high  customer demand at all times. But we are dependent on functioning  supply chains. There are, of course, opportunities to be found in every challenging  situation. We are taking advantage of these and have reacted quickly  and systematically in recent months. Activities have ranged from  inventory optimisation to sustainable efficiency measures in all areas  of the company. We are maintaining the momentum of the past few months  and actively shaping the transformation of the company. Thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Group boosts profitability and earnings in second quarter despite semiconductor shortage;The BMW Group continued performing dynamically in the second quarter, setting new record figures for sales, earnings and net profit. Demand for the Group’s premium vehicles has remained strong, with continued good pricing.;" Munich. The BMW Group continued performing  dynamically in the second quarter, setting new record figures for  sales, earnings and net profit. Demand for the Group’s premium  vehicles has remained strong, with continued good pricing. Reported figures for the second quarter improved significantly  compared to one year earlier, when the BMW Group posted a loss due to  the coronavirus pandemic. However, sales and earnings have also grown  solidly compared with the financial year 2019. “Our performance has benefited from strong customer demand during the  first half of the year, enabling us to achieve significant growth.  However, in light of a number of prevailing risks, including raw  materials prices and a shortage of semiconductors, the second  six-month period is likely to be more volatile for the BMW  Group,"" said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of    Management of BMW AG, in Munich on Tuesday: ""Despite  short-term challenges, we remain focused on the Group’s long-term  strategy of leveraging our great innovative strength and sustainable  profitability as the basis for successfully shaping the transformation  of our industry. In doing so, we are committed to finding the best  technological solutions to drive forward the progress of digital  connectivity and sustainable mobility."" The BMW Group is pushing ahead with its comprehensive strategy of  achieving sustainable, emission-free mobility. In line with the goals  of the Paris Climate Agreement, the BMW Group’s corporate strategy is  fully committed to ramping up e-mobility as swiftly as possible. After  the successful market launch of the BMW iX3*, the all-electric BMW i4  and iX models are set to follow in the autumn, equipped with the first  powerful variants of the new e-motor range. The BMW Group's  all-electric vehicles are synonymous with pure electric driving  pleasure and outstanding customer convenience. For example, the BMW  iX3* achieves a range of 100 km (WLTP) after just 10  minutes of charging at an HPC charging station. The new all-electric  models have generated a highly positive response in recent vehicle tests. Further models will be presented in the near future. Over the next  two years, electrification will cover nearly the entire breadth of the  BMW Group’s product portfolio. In the period up to  2025, the Group is set to grow its sales of  all-electric vehicles by an average of more than 50% p.a., delivering  around two million all-electric vehicles to customers  by the middle of the decade. The Neue Klasse is set to play a key role in this  move towards low-emission, sustainable mobility. From the middle of  the decade onwards, all future BMW Group models will share the core  features of the new vehicle architecture, uncompromisingly designed  for electric drive systems. The Neue Klasse will feature a completely    redefined IT and software architecture, a powerful,  newly developed generation of electric drive and battery  systems and a higher level of sustainabilityacross the entire life cycle. Over-the-air software upgrades for 2.5 million vehicles this yearThe BMW Group has been improving the connectivity of its vehicles for  many years, continuously providing customers with the latest software  and functionality enhancements via remote software upgrades. At the  present time, more than two million BMW Group vehicles are capable of  being upgraded 'over-the-air'. With its new BMW Operating  System 8, now installed for the first time in the BMW  iX, the premium manufacturer is incorporating the most  powerful data processing system available to date in its products,  enabling customers to order functions on demand at  any time and on a flexible basis. The BMW Group is also making progress in establishing a sustainable  circular economy. In collaboration with suppliers, the Group is  developing new production technologies as well as suitable sustainable  substitutes and far-reaching recycling concepts. This not only applies  to raw materials that are in limited supply, such as the lithium  required to manufacture batteries, but also to plastics and aluminium.  In the case of aluminium, one of the key materials used for vehicle  production, procedures are already in place at some sites to separate  this reusable resource. The BMW Group has placed sustainability and resource conservation at  the centre of its corporate strategy going forward, thereby embarking  on a path significantly more ambitious than the  two-degree target set for limiting global warming. In this context,  the measurable and verifiable targets the BMW Group  has set for the entire life cycle of its vehicles across all the three  emissions categories (‘Scopes 1-3’) have meanwhile been    validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative.  By 2030, the target is to reduce the BMW Group’s total global carbon  footprint per vehicle by at least one third compared to 2019, which  will lead to more than 200 million tonnes of carbon emissions being  avoided via technological measures. ""The progress we are making towards climate neutrality is being  documented in a way that is verifiable and transparent for everyone.  In line with the Paris Climate Agreement, our clearly defined aims put  us on a path significantly more ambitious than the two-degree target.  Moreover, we are fully committed to achieving these goals without  reservation or exception. It is our vision to create a value chain  with increasingly lower levels of emissions, culminating in a circular  economy,"" stated Oliver Zipse. With this approach, the BMW Group is preparing for the European    Green Deal. However, the EU Commission's recent  call for a further tightening of the 2030 decarbonisation targets for  automobiles (by 55% compared to 2021) can only be achieved with the  appropriate framework conditions and the joint efforts of industry and  policymakers. The expansion of charging infrastructure by the member  states envisaged in the EU is not ambitious enough and needs to be  implemented far more swiftly in order to be successful. The BMW Group  is stepping up its efforts to improve the charging  infrastructure – both at its own locations and in close  cooperation with its business partners. In line with this approach,  the Group has installed over 15,000 charging points  worldwide, including over 4,350 charging points  at its own locations, all of which are powered solely by  green electricity. BMW Group highly profitable in first half-year The BMW Group continued to perform well during the first six months  of 2021. Despite the challenges posed by the global pandemic  restrictions and the limited availability of semiconductor components,  which necessitated adjustments to the production schedule, sales  figures increased significantly. A total of 1,339,047 BMW,    MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles were delivered to  customers in the first six months of 2021, up by nearly 40% on the  previous year (2020: 962,575 units/ +39.1%) and setting a new Group  record for a first half-year period. All major sales regions  contributed to the overall growth in sales volume worldwide. The  picture was similar in the second quarter, with  deliveries to customers up by 44.7% year-on-year to 702,441 units  (2020: 485,464 units). Sustained high demand for the BMW Group’s electrified vehicles also  provided strong momentum for growth. Between January and June 2021,  153,243 all-electric vehicles and plug-in  hybrids were delivered to customers (2020: 61,652 units), an  increase of 148.6% compared to one year earlier. The  high rate of growth in the sale of electrified vehicles gathered even  greater momentum in the second quarter, rising by as much as 167.0%. Significant growth in Group revenues and earningsRevenues were significantly higher year on year, both in the first  six-month period at € 55,360 million (2020: € 43,225  million/ +28.1%, currency-adjusted: +31.1%) and in the second quarter  2021 at € 28,582 million (2020: € 19,973 million/  +43.1%, currency-adjusted: +45.2%), driven by higher sales volumes and  better selling prices achieved across both new and pre-owned  automobile markets.The favourable market environment also led to a lower risk    provisioning for expected residual value and credit risks  compared to one year earlier, as well as partial releases of credit  risks. Earnings also benefited from the partial release of the    provision in conjunction with EU antitrust proceedings,  which were concluded in July with the payment of a fine  amounting to € 372.8 million. Group research and development expenditure totalled    € 2,574 million (2020: € 2,852 million/ -9.7%, Q2/2021:€ 1,287 million/ -15.8%, Q2/2020: € 1,528 million).  The BMW Group has striven forward substantial future technologies in  the first half-year with focus on the further development of electric  drive systems, automated driving and the digitisation of the Group’s  model portfolio. The R&D figures reported for 2021 also include  initial upfront expenditure for the Neue Klasse. The R&D ratio was 4.6% for the  half-year under report and 4.5% for the second  quarter (R&D ratio HY1/2020: 6.6%"; Q2/2021:    € 5,979 million, Q2/2020: loss of € 300 million). The Group's EBT margin for the first half of 2021  came in at 17.6% (HY1/2020: 1.2%; Q2/2021:    20.9%, Q2/2020: -1.5%). Group net profit  amounted to € 7,623 million (HY1/2020: € 362 million;"    Q2/2021: € 4,790 million, Q2/2020: net loss of  € 212 million). """"Sustainable profitability is the foundation that enables us to  invest in the electrification and digitisation of our models as well  as in automated driving. In a strong first half-year, we continued to  work rigorously on driving our operating performance. Efficiency  improvement measures are also bearing fruit. For example, we have made  good progress in reducing complexity, as new package solutions are  boosting efficiency across the entire range of our products and  services while at the same time improving and simplifying the customer  experience. We are also focusing on our sales structures, using  digital analysis tools to manage our sales and marketing activities.  As previously announced, by 2025 we aim to reduce production costs per  vehicle by one quarter compared to 2019. Here, too, we are making good  use of virtual planning processes and constantly striving to optimise  logistics and plant capacity utilisation,"""" said Dr    Nicolas Peter, member of the Board of Management, Finance  in Munich on Tuesday. Significant growth for BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce brands in second quarterIn the period from April to June 2021, the BMW Group delivered a new  record total of 702,441 units to customers worldwide  (Q2/2020: 485,464 units/ +44.7%), comprising 617,667 BMW brand  vehicles (Q2/2020: 430,344 units/ +43.5%), 83,165 MINI brand vehicles  (Q2/2020: 54,413 units/ +52.8%) and 1,609 Rolls-Royce brand vehicles  (Q2/2020: 707 units/ +127.6%). Sales volume growth worldwideThe BMW Group recorded significant growth across all regions of the  world, both for the six-month period and the second quarter. In Europe, deliveries to customers in the first half  of the year rose by more than one third (+35.4%) to  504,834 units (HY1/2020: 372,754 units";    Q2/2021: 265,816 units, Q2/2020: 151,730 units/  +75.2%). Sales of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles in  Germany were also significantly up, with    136,058 units delivered to customers in the first  half of the year (HY1/2020: 116,362 units/ +16.9%; Q2/2021:    73,362 units, Q2/2020: 50,358 units/ +45.7%). Business also gathered pace in the Americas during  the period under report, with 225,144 BMW, MINI and  Rolls-Royce brand vehicles delivered between January and June  (HY1/2020: 152,580 units/ +47.6%, Q2/2021: 128,792units, Q2/2020: 70,502 units/ +82.7%). The upward  trend also continued in the USA, with deliveries up  by more than one half to 184,436 units (HY1/2020:  121,318 units/ +52.0%; Q2/2021: 106,369 units,  Q2/2020: 56,425 units/ +88.5%). In Asia, the number of vehicles sold at the half-way  stage of the year totalled 580,351 units (HY1/2020:  416,882 units/ +39.2%; Q2/2021: 292,654 units,  Q2/2020: 253,942 units/ +15.2%). Growth continues unabated in  China, where the BMW Group recorded a 42.0% increase  to 467,956 units for the six-month period (HY1/2020:  329,447 units; Q2/2021: 237,763units, Q2/2020: 212,870 units/ +11.7%).  Significant rise in Automotive segment revenuesRevenues generated by the Automotive segment rose to € 47,745  million for the six-month period (HY1/2020: € 32,867 million/  +45.3%; Q2/2021: € 24,983 million, Q2/2020: € 14,878  million/ +67.9%), driven primarily by higher sales volume, revenue  growth for spare parts and accessories, a more favourable model mix  and good pricing. The segment profit before financial result (EBIT)  amounted to € 6,189 million (HY1/2020: loss of  € 1,325 million; Q2/2021: € 3,953 million, Q2/2020:  loss of € 1,554 million). Segment profit before tax (EBT) for the six-month  period improved to € 7,526 million (HY1/2020: loss  of € 1,093 million; Q2/2021: € 4,750 million,  Q2/2020: loss of € 1,173 million), driven by the combined impact of  higher sales volume, better residual values and income recognised on  the release of the provision for EU antitrust proceedings. The segment  EBIT margin for the six-month period came in at 13.0%  (HY1/2020: negative 4.0%; Q2/2021: 15.8%, Q2/2020:  negative 10.4%). Free cash flow generated by the Automotive  segment for the period from January to June 2021 totalled € 4,902 million (2020: negative € 2,513 million). The  increase in cash flows from operating activities mainly reflected  higher earnings before tax and the favourable development of working  capital. The combined effect of systematic working capital management  and production restrictions due to semiconductor supply bottlenecks  resulted in a low level of inventories. For the full year, the BMW  Group aims to achieve a free cash flow above the previous year's  best-to-date figure of € 5.8 billion. This target, however, is subject  to the semiconductor supply situation not worsening significantly. Financial Services segment on course for successThe excellent performance of the Financial Services  segment in the first half of 2021 is reflected in the  significant increase of its reported figures. After the negative  impact on business during the corona pandemic year 2020, growth in new  business with leasing and financing products brought about a  significant improvement in segment earnings. Expressed in balance  sheet terms, segment business volume increased slightly compared to 31  December 2020. In total, 1,029,345new credit financing and leasing contracts were  signed with retail customers between January and June 2021, a  significant increase of 28.0% over the previous year’s corresponding  period, when business was held down by the heavy impact of the  coronavirus pandemic (2020: 804,452 contracts). Over the six-month  period, 50.2% of new BMW Group vehicles were either leased or financed  by the Financial Services segment (2020: 51.3%/ -1.1 percentage points).New business with credit financing and leasing  contracts concluded with retail customers during the period from  January to June grew by 29.5% to € 32,445 million (2020: € 25,057  million). All regions recorded considerable year-on-year growth. Significant improvement in Financial Services segment earningsThe Financial Services segment generated revenues  totalling € 16,106million in the first half of the year (HY1/2020:  € 14,256 million/ +13.0%; Q2/2021: € 8,200 million/  +23.2%, Q2/2020: € 6,658 million). Profit before tax for the six-month period amounted  to € 1,936 million, setting a new record for the  segment (HY1/2020: € 581 million; Q2/2021: € 1,149 million,  Q2/2020: € 97 million). The main contributing factors for  earnings growth were the improved overall risk situation and higher  marketing revenues from the sale of returned lease vehicles,  especially on the US market. The Financial Services segment makes  provision to take account of significant business risks on an ongoing  and comprehensive basis. Based on current assessments, appropriate  levels of provisions have been recognised to cover residual value and  credit risks. Motorcycles segment posts best deliveries and earnings figures    to date The Motorcycles segment demonstrated its operating  strength during the period under report, launching eight new models in  the first six months of the year and setting a new record with    107,610 units delivered to customers (HY1/2020:  76,707 units/ +40.3%; Q2/2021: 65,018 units/ +55.1%,  Q2/2020: 41,933 units). The segment profit before financial result (EBIT)  amounted to € 284 million (HY1/2020: € 65 million;    Q2/2021: € 149 million, Q2/2020: loss of € 7 million).The EBIT margin for the six-month period came in at  17.5% (HY1/2020: 6.0%;" Q2/2021:  17.2%, Q2/2020: negative 1.3%). Semiconductor shortage and higher raw materials prices likely    to impact second half-year For the full year 2021, the BMW Group expects business to develop  positively overall.""""The forecast is based on the assumption that neither the  coronavirus pandemic nor the semiconductor supply situation will  worsen significantly and that prices on international raw materials  markets remain stable. We were largely able to compensate for the  challenging semiconductor supply problems arising in the first six  months through the sheer hard work of our purchasing, production and  sales staff. However, the longer the supply bottlenecks last, the more  tense the situation is likely to become. We expect production  restrictions to continue in the second half of the year and hence a  corresponding impact on sales volumes,"""" Dr Peter stated. In view of the generally positive growth forecasts for the global  economy, the BMW Group is raising its full-year outlook for the  Financial Services and Motorcycles segments. The Automotive segment is expected to record a solid  year-on-year increase in the number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand  vehicles delivered to customers. Due to the EU antitrust proceedings,  the segment EBIT margin for the full year was adjusted in May and is  likely to come in at the upper end of a range of 7 to 9% (previous  forecast: 6 to 8%). Segment RoCE is forecast to increase significantly. The BMW Group expects the risk provisioning of the Financial    Services segment for credit and residual value risks will  also be lower in the second half of 2021 than previously assumed in  the Quarterly Statement for the period ended 31 March 2021.  Accordingly, the BMW Group now expects the Return on Equity (RoE) for  the Financial Services segment within a range of 17 to 20% (previous  forecast: 12 to 15%). The Motorcycles segment is now predicted to record a  significant increase in deliveries due to the positive market trend  (previous forecast: solid increase). The EBIT margin is likely to  finish within a target range of 8 to 10%, enabling the segment to  record a significantly higher level of RoCE than one year earlier. The BMW Group also reaffirms its forecast for non-financial    performance indicators. Accordingly, the proportion of  women in management functions is expected to increase slightly. At the  same time, the BMW Group is targeting a further significant reduction  in the carbon emissions generated by its EU new vehicle fleet.  According to current expectations, carbon emissions per vehicle  produced are likely to decrease moderately. The Group's targets for the year are to be met with a    slightly smaller workforce. Macroeconomic and  political developments as well as international trade and customs  policies could also have a negative impact on the BMW Group's business performance.  Q2 2021Q2 2020Change in %Deliveries to customers1Automotiveunits702,441485,46444.7thereof:        BMW2units617,667430,34443.5MINIunits83,16554,41352.8Rolls-Royceunits1,609707127.6Motorcyclesunits65,01841,93355.1     Employees                                                              (as at 31.12.2020)120,726 -4.23     Automotive segment          EBIT margin%15.8-10.4-Motorcycles          segment EBIT margin%17.2-1.3-EBT margin BMW Group4%20.9-1.5-     Revenues€ million28,58219,97343.1thereof:        Automotive€ million24,98314,87867.9Motorcycles€ million86852266.3Financial        Services€ million8,2006,65823.2Other        Entities€ million1–-Eliminations€ million-5,470-2,085-     Earnings before financial result        (EBIT)€ million5,005-6661,375-thereof:        Automotive€ million3,953-1,554-Motorcycles€ million149-7-Financial        Services€ million1,12877-Other        Entities€ million113-Eliminations€ million-226805-     Earnings before tax (EBT)€ million5,979-300-thereof:        Automotive€ million4,750-1,173-Motorcycles€ million149-8-Financial        Services€ million1,14997-Other        Entities€ million124-64-Eliminations€ million-193848-     Income taxes€ million-1,18988-Net profit€ million4,790-212-Earnings per share(common/preferred stock) 5 €7.23 / 7.24-0.35 /        -0.34-/-1In connection with a review of its sales practices and  related reporting practices, the BMW Group has reviewed prior-period  vehicle delivery data and ascertained that certain vehicle deliveries  were not reported in the correct periods. The BMW Group has revised  its vehicle delivery data retrospectively for previous years. Further  information on this matter is provided in the BMW Group Report 2020  from page 128.

New home for the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family in the WorldSBK paddock.;The BMW Motorrad Motorsport family has moved into its new home in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) paddock. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, officially opened the new BMW Hospitality in the WorldSBK paddock at the fifth round of the season at Assen (NED). This will function as a meeting place and focal point for BMW teams, partners, guests and – as soon as this is possible again – fans.;Munich. The BMW Motorrad Motorsport family has moved into its    new home in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) paddock.    Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, officially opened the new BMW    Hospitality in the WorldSBK paddock at the fifth round of the season    at Assen (NED). This will function as a meeting place and focal    point for BMW teams, partners, guests and – as soon as this is    possible again – fans. The new BMW Hospitality will be operated for    BMW Motorrad Motorsport by the BMW works team Shaun Muir Racing. “I am really proud to see how our WorldSBK project is developing and  how it has grown since our comeback,” said Schramm, before cutting the  symbolic tape to officially open the hospitality area. “And it is  great that our large BMW family now has a new home in the paddock: our  brand-new BMW Hospitality. Special thanks are due to Shaun Muir and  the whole SMR team for making this possible. Now we are looking  forward to celebrating some great moments together in our new  hospitality area.” Shaun Muir Racing has been a partner of BMW Motorrad Motorsport in  WorldSBK since the works re-entry and this collaboration has now been extended. “We are delighted to present our new hospitality unit,” explained  Shaun Muir. “This runs alongside to our new agreement with BMW  Motorrad Motorsport and shows our investment to the project and the  level we want to achieve in line with our championship winning  expectations. We value the involvement of our VIPs and sponsors and I  think this addition to our assets compliments the level we want to  achieve. More than that, it is a great opportunity for fans and  partners to meet and come into direct contact with the team.” The new BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Hospitality was owned previously by a  Formula 1 team and was adjusted to meet its new requirements during  months of painstaking alterations. The result is a prestigious  structure with space for more than 100 guests each day. The two-storey  building contains three dining areas. The 132 m2 main deck  on the upper floor has room for up to 50 seats and a lounge corner.  The race events will unfold on two large 70-inch screens, which can  also be used for Esports activities. In addition to the food buffet,  there is a coffee bar in this area and a self-service corner with a  large selection of drinks. The upper area is connected to the large  kitchen on the ground floor via a service elevator. Depending on the  type of use envisaged, the 72 m2 ground floor can seat at  least 25 guests and is a multi-functional space that can be a showroom  for motorbikes or for one car. The exterior of the BMW Motorrad  WorldSBK Hospitality is clad in the recognisable BMW M Motorsport  colours. The overall appearance includes a 36 m2 sun  terrace with 30 seats, where guests can relax under two broad  canopies. Food can be prepared for 100 guests each day in the modern  catering kitchen that is integrated into one of the trucks. This can  provide breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as preparing snacks  throughout the day for guests and the BMW teams. As soon as the Coronavirus situation permits, SMR and BMW Motorrad  Motorsport will once again be offering weekend packages including  hospitality access for interested guests and fans. The BMW Hospitality  unit can also be reserved for external events.   The two BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team riders, Tom Sykes (GBR) and  Michael van der Mark (NED), present the new BMW Hospitality in more  detail in a YouTube video: b.mw/WorldSBK_Hospitality ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Battle for the podium at the 24h Spa-Francorchamps comes to an early end for Walkenhorst Motorsport.;Walkenhorst Motorsport battled for the podium with both BMW M6 GT3s at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), but their strong performance went unrewarded. Both cars retired during the night.;Spa-Francorchamps. Walkenhorst Motorsport battled for the    podium with both BMW M6 GT3s at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps    (BEL), but their strong performance went unrewarded. Both cars    retired during the night. The #35 BMW M6 GT3, with Martin Tomczyk,    Timo Glock (both GER) and Thomas Neubauer (FRA) at the wheel, was    damaged in a collision. The #34 BMW M6 GT3 suffered a technical    issue. That car was shared by Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco    Wittmann (GER) and David Pittard (GBR). When night fell after the opening stage with periods of heavy rain,  the #35 was on track to the podium in third place. A collision  occurred shortly before midnight, however, while Tomczyk was lapping  another car and the left front suspension broke. After a repair break,  the #35 returned to the track but then had to retire. The #34, which  successfully fought its way back up the field after tyre damage early  on, was then in line for a podium finish, but Pittard was forced to  park the car at the edge of the track at around half past three in the  morning when the car lost drive. The #10 BMW M6 GT3 of Boutsen Ginion Racing, which contested the  Pro-Am Cup, crossed the finish line in 35th position. Jens Klingmann  (GER), Karim Ojjeh (KSA), Jens Liebhauser (GER) and Yann Zimmer (SUI)  took turns at the wheel of the car. Quotes from the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps: Niclas Königbauer (Team Manager Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “Obviously, it is a bitter disappointment. We  were up there fighting for the podium with both cars. The drivers and  the whole team were highly motivated, and we saw that we had the pace  in the race, but sometimes things work out differently than you hope.  The fact that two unfortunate situations meant we didn’t finish with  either car makes us very sad – particularly as it was the BMW M6 GT3’s  farewell race here at Spa-Francorchamps.” Sheldon van der Linde (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “It’s a very bitter pill to swallow after such a  strong start to the weekend. We were up there in every single session  and I honestly think we had all the ingredients to win this race but  unfortunately we had to retire the car early in the morning. It’s a  big shame, especially as both cars were out. It hurts twice as much  when you are in such a good position and know you have a strong  package and all you need to do is to bring it home. But Spa is such a  hard race to win, you need so much luck and you have so many different  factors involved that all need to fall into place and unfortunately  that wasn’t the case this year.” Marco Wittmann (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “Obviously, it is a disappointing outcome for  us, especially seeing as both cars retired. We had incredibly strong  pace and were in the position of being able to battle for the podium  or even the win. After tyre damage in the opening stage, we battled  our way back up through the field gradually, and I handed the car over  to David in third place. But then we had to retire. It’s really sad  because we had a strong car and wanted to commemorate the BMW M6 GT3  with a different result in its final 24-hour race at Spa. But that’s  motorsport for you.” David Pittard (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “I am obviously very disappointed for us in both  the #34 car and the #35 car. Walkenhorst Motorsport had prepared two  front-running cars but then unfortunately both had issues while  running in the top three. Unfortunately, that is endurance racing and  you always have to expect these things but it makes it all the more  painful when you are running so close to the front. A big thanks to  all the team for all their efforts to make the car so quick and put us  in such a competitive position. Unfortunately it wasn’t meant to be  this year for Walkenhorst Motorsport and BMW.” Martin Tomczyk (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “It’s a shame that both cars retired. Everything  was going really well for us in the #35, we had a strong pace, the car  was good and I was faster than the two leaders in my stint. I was  within reach of them but then the collision happened while overtaking.  That brought the 24-hour race to an end for us. It was a real shame,  but these are the kind of things that happen in motorsport, however  bitter they may be. Now we’re focussing on the next race, which will  hopefully turn out better.” Timo Glock (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport):  “Both cars retiring was a real shame for the whole team. But that’s  24-hour races. Our car was really good, we were in the top three, had  a flawless race with strong stints, had no track limit warnings and  nothing. Before the accident we were at a very, very good level and  were in a really good position for getting a strong result. Martin and  Thomas drove fantastic stints, and I was also very pleased with mine.  I had good pace and worked the car up into the top three. I felt very  at ease in the car.” Thomas Neubauer (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “It was really heartbreaking to see both our  BMWs retiring from the race. We all had a really strong pace and  everyone, the drivers, Walkenhorst Motorsport and BMW did a great job  this weekend. That is why it’s even tougher to finish like this. But  we showed that we were fighting for the top positions, and now we just  need to keep our head high and move on to the next race. A big thank  you to Walkenhorst Motorsport and BMW for providing such an amazing  car. It was so much fun driving this car. It was not the way we wanted  to finish the last 24 hours of Spa for the BMW M6 GT3 but it is what  it is. Motorsport can be an amazing sport and very ruthless at the  same time.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Right after Super Pole, the new BMW M4 GT3 completed several demonstration laps of the ‘Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps’.;Spa-Francorchamps. Everything is ready for the classic    endurance race in the Ardennes: Walkenhorst Motorsport secured a    promising starting position for the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps    (BEL) in Super Pole qualification on Friday evening. Sheldon van der    Linde (RSA) claimed fifth place in the #34 BMW M6 GT3, Thomas    Neubauer (FRA) finished the final qualifying session in the #35 BMW    M6 GT3 in 14th place. Van der Linde is sharing the cockpit in the #34 car with Marco  Wittmann (GER) and David Pittard (GBR). Neubauer will be driving the  #35 car with Martin Tomczyk and Timo Glock (both GER). The two BMW M6  GT3s put on a strong performance in Thursday’s multi-session  qualifying, which was red-flagged several times. The average of the  best times for the individual drivers in each car is calculated to  determine qualifying classification. The 20 fastest cars move on to  Super Pole. This posed no problem for Walkenhorst Motorsport, with  fifth place for the #34 car and #35 in sixth. On Friday afternoon, it was time for a different event, the FANATEC  Esports GT Pro Series race. This sim racing series is a central  element of the FANATEC GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, which  also includes the 24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps. Each team  nominates a driver who competes in the race on the Assetto Corsa  Competizione platform and can score points for the real overall  standings. Victory at Spa-Francorchamps went to BMW as Pittard won the  sim race for the Walkenhorst Motorsport team. Super Pole followed on Friday evening, a shootout with two flying  laps for each car. Rain began to fall just before the start of the  final qualifying session, but the conditions were still conducive to  driving on slicks. The two BMW M6 GT3s went out onto the track, one  after the other. Van der Linde recorded a fastest time of 2:18.590  minutes, which was enough to secure fifth on the grid for him and his  team-mates. Neubauer claimed 14th place, going round in 2:19.011 minutes. “That was a really good Super Pole for us and that makes me happy,”  said van der Linde. “We are also aware that qualifying is not decisive  at Spa, so I am confident about the race. I think that we’ve got a  good race car, which is what counts. But it was nice to be driving in  Super Pole for the first time. Thanks to the team for placing their  trust in me. Now I am hoping that we can record a great result.” “It is not easy to compete against the world’s fastest GT3 drivers in  Super Pole, and when you see a bit of rain as you are getting into the  car, things get a bit more tense. But we were still able to push on  dry tyres and the track conditions were good,” reported Neubauer. “Us  BMW drivers had a decent qualifying session, and especially Sheldon  did a mega job so congratulations to him. Our plan is now to make a  good start, then to keep our heads down and avoid making any mistakes.” The #10 BMW M6 GT3 car from Boutson Ginion Racing, competing in the  Pro-Am Cup, will be starting from 45th position. Jens Klingmann (GER),  Karim Ojjeh (KSA), Jens Liebhauser (GER) and Yann Zimmer (SUI) will be  sharing driving duties in this car. Right after Super Pole, BMW M Motorsport provided a glimpse of the  future as the new BMW M4 GT3 completed several demonstration laps of  the ‘Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps’. The new GT3 flagship, which will  be competing as of 2022, appeared with Glock at the wheel before  Klingmann took over. “It was so much fun driving the new BMW M4 GT3 here. Those were my  very first laps in this car, but I have to say that all the hard work  that has been put into this race car has really paid off,” explained  Glock later. “As soon as you get into the BMW M4 GT3, you feel good.  The driving position and the level of driving comfort are just as good  as everything else. The car feels very, very good right away and  delivers convincing driveability. The guys really did some outstanding  work. I am already looking forward to getting some more laps in with  the car, but that was a very positive start.” “Driving the first demo laps with the new BMW M4 GT3 was definitely  something special,” said Klingmann. “That gives you an idea of what  next year will be like, when we will hopefully be battling for overall  wins with that car. But I think that the demo laps were enough to  realise just how much potential the car has. I can now compare it  directly with the BMW M6 GT3, which I am also driving here this  weekend, and I think that the car gets a great reception in the  paddock. A lot of teams have already shown an interest, which shows  that BMW M Motorsport is on the right path with the BMW M4 GT3.” The 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps will start on Saturday, 31st July  at 16:30.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A world premiere like never before. ;BMW R 18 B and R 18 Transcontinental celebrate their debuts in The Cadillac Three’s new music video.;"Munich. The new BMW R 18 B and R 18 Transcontinental  celebrate their world premieres like no other motorcycle before: they  are starring in the music video of well-knownBig Machine Records  act The Cadillac Three and their new song “Get After  It”. After various digital world premieres, this is another completely  new approach to show a new bike for the first time.The collaboration with the band from Nashville, Tennessee (USA)  came to life just natural. “One of the most exciting things about this  partnership is being able to combine awesome music and motorcycles. It  was a truly special experience to be the first person in the USA to  ride these new bikes for the first time,” says lap-steel guitarist  Kelby Ray, who is a passionate rider himself.The video production took place just outside of Nashville in  June with director Dylan Rucker leading the high-octane clip. “This  was such an awesome experience! While recording the track we tried to  incorporate the feeling of getting on that BMW Motorrad bike for the  first time while playing a really loud guitar through huge Marshall  stacks like we do out on the road. I think we nailed it,”  Singer-guitarist Jaren Johnston adds. And the third member of the  band, drummer Neil Mason, says: “We’ve had a great relationship with  Marshall Amplifiers for a long time and when we found out they’d  recommended us to BMW to help launch their new motorcycle with a music  video for “Get After It,” it felt like a big ole hell yes for us.”Riding a motorcycle while listening to music – both fit well  together, as they promise deep emotional experiences and intense  pleasure on two wheels. It is not for nothing that generations of  artists have dedicated their songs to the experience of motorcycling.“BMW Motorrad stands for the passion for riding, but it’s also  about meeting people and being part of the community,” says Ralf  Rodepeter, Head of Marketing and Product Management BMW Motorrad.  “Both music and riding a motorcycle are just about pure emotion. I  can’t think of a better song than this awesome track from The Cadillac  Three for this project.” To ensure that beats and basses perfectly  complement the ear while riding, BMW Motorrad has long been engaged in  intensive development work on its sound systems. With its now agreed  long-term partnership with world-renowned British company Marshall  Amplification, the innovation and quality of BMW Motorrad sound  systems are set to reach new heights.With the Marshall sound system, the new R 18 Transcontinental  and R 18 B offer an intense sound experience. Already as standard both  bikes feature a sound system developed in collaboration with the  British manufacturer Marshall, featuring 2-way speakers integrated  into the front of the fairing. Black speaker grilles with white  Marshall lettering round off the classic look. The Marshall Gold  Series Stage 1 and Stage 2 sound systems are optionally ex works to  provide even more intensive listening pleasure. Up to 4 loudspeakers  and 2 subwoofers with 280 watts of total output provide incomparable  sound quality and ""good vibrations"".For 60 years, Marshall, originally from Hanwell, London, now  based in Bletchley, Milton Keynes (UK), have produced legendary guitar  amplifiers used by the world’s best musicians. Since 2012 they have  expanded their audio quality into award winning headphones and active  speakers designed for music lovers.“The legendary Marshall spirit and the development power of BMW  Motorrad just fit perfectly together. It’s the perfect match,” says  Alex Coombes, Commercial Director Marshall. “We’re already looking  forward of much more to come”.With the new R 18 Transcontinental, BMW Motorrad is adding a  Grand American Tourer to the R 18 family as well as the R 18 B  ""Bagger"", which is particularly popular in the USA. As with  the previous R 18 models, the new R 18 Transcontinental and R 18 B  combine the thrilling power of the ""Big Boxer"" with a  classic chassis concept based on historical models, exclusive  equipment and a stylish design.The two new members of the R 18 family will be presented on 6  August in Sturgis, South Dakota, USA for the first time to the public.

Not only its  impressive appearance, but also its technical specifications show its  ties to the traditional air-cooled boxer engines that have provided  inspiring riding experiences for more than seven decades since BMW  Motorrad began manufacturing motorcycles in 1923. The most powerful  2-cylinder flat twin engine ever built in motorbike series production  boasts an engine capacity of 1,802 cc. It generates an output of 67 kW  (91 hp) at 4 750 rpm. In the 2,000 to 4,000 rpm range, it delivers  more than 150 Nm of torque at all times as well as elemental pulling  power and sonorous sound.Double-loop tube frame made of steel and a backbone made of    sheet metal formed parts and rear swinging arm with enclosed axle    drive in rigid-frame design.The heart of the chassis of the new R 18 Transcontinental and R  18 B is a double-loop tube steel frame made of steel with a backbone  of sheet metal formed parts. Its design perpetuates the longstanding  BMW Motorrad tradition of this frame type. The particularly high  manufacturing quality and attention to detail are also evident in  barely perceptible details such as the welded joints between steel  tubes and cast or forged parts. Like the legendary BMW R 5, the rear  swinging arm, which is manufactured in a similar design, encloses the  rear axle drive in the same style using bolted connections.Telescopic fork with fork sleeves, cantilever suspension    strut, light alloy cast wheels and disc brakes in combination with BMW Motorrad Full Integral ABS.The suspension elements of the new R 18 Transcontinental and R  18 B deliberately dispense with any adjustment options that the rider  has to make. Instead, a telescopic fork and a directly swinging-arm  mounted cantilever suspension strut with travel-dependent damping and  automatically adjustable spring preload ensure superior light-alloy  cast wheel control and responsive suspension comfort.In order to  achieve the best possible ride response even when riding with a  pillion and fully loaded, the rear suspension strut features  travel-dependent damping andautomatic load compensation. As in  the legendary BMW R 5, the tubes of the telescopic fork are encased in  fork sleeves. The fork tube diameter is 49 mm, suspension travel is  120 mm at the front and rear. The new R 18 Transcontinental and R 18 B  are decelerated by a double disc brake at the front and a single disc  brake at the rear in conjunction with four-piston fixed callipers and  BMW Motorrad Full Integral ABS.Dynamic Cruise Control (DCC) as standard. Active Cruise Control (ACC) – cruise control with integrated    distance control for relaxed touring as an ex works option.The R 18 Transcontinental and R 18 B are already equipped as  standard with DCC electronic cruise control (Dynamic Cruise Control).  DCC automatically regulates the riding speed set by the rider. Dynamic  means that the pre-selected speed is kept constant even when riding  downhill. Active Cruise Control (ACC) allows relaxed gliding with  distance control – without the rider having to adjust the speed to the  vehicle in front. With the aid of radar sensors integrated in the  front fairing, the motorcycle is either accelerated automatically to  adjust the speed or the new, standard full integral braking system is  applied for deceleration purposes, depending on the situation on the  road. ACC also ensures particularly safe cornering. Where necessary,  the cornering control system automatically reduces the speed, giving  the rider the right speed for a comfortable and safe banking angle.Coherent ergonomics for best possible motorcycle control.The new R 18 Transcontinental and R 18 B feature a  casual,so-called ""mid-mounted footpeg"" position of the  footrests, entirely in keeping with the BMW Motorrad philosophy. This  classic position behind the cylinders is not only typical of BMW, it  also allows a relaxed and active riding position for the best possible  motorcycle control. The R 18 Transcontinental is equipped with an  especially comfortable seat and seat heating as standard to ensure  long-distance riding comfort even in two-person operation. The R 18 B  has a somewhat slimmer two-person seat bench.The new R 18  Transcontinental is fitted as standard with running boards and the  newR 18 B with wider and more comfortable footrests than the R 18.Cockpit featuring classically designed round instruments and    10.25” TFT colour screen with map navigation for convenient route    planning and extensive connectivity as standard.The  cockpit, specially designed for the new R 18 Transcontinental and R 18  B, with four analogue round instruments and a 10.25 inch TFT colour  display, blends into the classic appearance harmoniously. Featuring  the iconic ""BERLIN BUILT"" lettering, it follows the classic  style of the new R 18 Transcontinental and R 18 B on the one hand, and  on the other hand offers a perfectly readable TFT colour display  providing a maximum of functionality and information.Three riding modes as well as ASC and MSR as standard for a    high degree of riding fun and safety. Reversing aid and Hill Start    Control as an ex works option.In order to meet individual customer needs, the new R 18  Transcontinental and R 18 B also feature the three riding modes  ""Rain"", ""Roll"" and ""Rock"" as standard,  which is unusual in this segment. The standard equipment also includes  ASC(Automatic Stability Control), which ensures a high level of  riding safety.In addition, the new R 18 Transcontinental and R  18 B are equipped with an engine drag torque control (MSR) as  standard. In addition to other options, a reversing aid makes  manoeuvring a comfortable affair and the Hill Start Control function  makes starting off uphill easy.The new R 18 Transcontinental and R 18 B: Iconic streamlining    combined with rigid frame look and modern technology.The new R 18 Transcontinental stands out as a luxurious tourer  and the new R 18 B as a stylish ""Bagger"" with its  characteristic ""streamlining"", which perfectly integrates  the front fairing, cases and, in the case of the R 18  Transcontinental, the top case. They transfer the iconic style of the  great tourers and cruisers of yesteryear to the present day. The  purist design, which has been shaped by numerous BMW Motorrad  classics, lives on in many details. Functional and style-defining  elements such as the double-loop tube frame, the 24 litre pear-drop  fuel tank, the open universal shaft drive or the double-line paintwork  (ex works option) are reminiscent of legendary BMW boxer motorcycles.  The suspension also harks back splendidly to the old days. Together  with the double-sided swinging arm and a cantilever suspension strut,  the rigid frame layout of the R 5 has been perfectly transferred to  modern times.Audio system with Marshall sound system: A new digital sound    dimension as standard ex works.With the Marshall sound system, the new R 18 Transcontinental  and R 18 B offer an intense sound experience. Already as standard the  new R 18 Transcontinental and R 18 B feature a sound system developed  in collaboration with the British manufacturer Marshall, featuring  2-way speakers integrated into the front of the fairing. Black cover  grilles with white Marshall lettering round off the classic look. The  Marshall Gold Series Stage 1 and Stage 2 sound systems are optionally  ex works to provide even more intensive listening pleasure. Up to 4  loudspeakers and 2 subwoofers with 280 watts of total output provide  incomparable sound quality and ""good vibrations"". For 60  years, Marshall, originally from Hanwell, London, now based in  Bletchley, Milton Keynes (UK), have produced legendary guitar  amplifiers used by the world’s best musicians. Since 2012 they have  expanded their audio quality into award winning headphones and active  speakers designed for music lovers. The R 18 Transcontinental First Edition and R 18 B First    Edition: Exclusive look in paint and chrome.Right from the time of market launch, the new R 18  Transcontinental and R 18 B will be available worldwide as exclusive R  18 Transcontinental First Edition andR 18 B First Edition  versions. They combine the R 18 look with exclusive features in  classic black paintwork with white double-lining. Further highlights  are the specially designed surfaces (Chrome Package), high-grade  stitching on the seat and the""First Edition” lettering.Large variety of parts allow for perfect customizing and    optimum individualisation.

The BMW Group at the IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich.;Driving pleasure in a variety of forms, innovations designed to increase sustainability across the board and visions for the urban mobility of tomorrow form the core of the BMW Group’s presence at the IAA Mobility 2021 show. ;Driving pleasure in a variety of forms, innovations designed to  increase sustainability across the board and visions for the urban  mobility of tomorrow form the core of the BMW Group’s presence at the  IAA Mobility 2021 show. A presentation of the latest new models and  pioneering technological innovations gives visitors to the event –  which is taking place for the first time in the company’s home city of  Munich on 7–12 September 2021 – an overview of premium mobility in its  present-day and future forms.At an array of locations around the Bavarian capital, the BMW Group –  the largest exhibitor at the IAA – will offer visitors active driving  experiences, insights into its development work and the opportunity to  discuss the challenges of the future. At the heart of it all are the  company’s far-reaching sustainability goals. The BMW Group has  announced that it will reduce its CO2 emissions by more  than 200 million tonnes by 2030. This will be achieved by making  changes in areas such as raw materials extraction, production, the  usage phase of its vehicles and recycling. The aim is to cut  CO2 emissions from production by 80 per cent up to 2030 and  bring a total of around ten million fully electric vehicles onto the  roads over the next ten years or so. In addition, the company is  planning to reduce CO2 emissions per vehicle over the  course of its lifecycle by at least a third.Circular economy is the central theme of IAA Mobility  2021.A heightened commitment to a circular economy and  the associated lower resources consumption will have a significant  impact. This is why the BMW Group is making circular economy the  central theme of IAA Mobility 2021. With its “Re:think, Re:duce,  Re:use, Re:cycle” approach, the company is revealing an  all-encompassing view of how the use of primary raw materials can be  dramatically reduced for the vehicles of the future. In order to  reduce resources consumption per vehicle, the proportion of secondary  materials used – e.g. recycled steel, plastic or aluminium – needs to  increase significantly.The BMW Group is also taking a holistic view of sustainability, and  that means addressing social sustainability, materials procurement,  supply chains and social responsibility when it comes to both the  community as a whole and its employees. The company is aiming to put  in place the most sustainable supply chain in the whole of the  automotive industry.The BMW iX: technology flagship for sustainable  mobility.Of the new vehicles taking to the stage at the  IAA Mobility 2021, the star of the show is the BMW  iX. The BMW Group’s new technology flagship is blazing a trail for  innovations in the fields of electric mobility and digitalisation.  Fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology enables locally emission-free  driving pleasure with electric all-wheel drive and a long operating  range. The BMW iX is based on a new future toolkit covering various  development fields – the on-board network architecture, software,  digital services, connectivity and automated driving functions. The  advances achieved as a result can be seen in the latest generation of  the iDrive control/operating system, exceptionally efficient energy  management and numerous innovative driver assistance systems.The BMW iX is a modern SUV which has been designed from the inside  out and which redefines the idea of interior spaciousness and luxury.  The BMW Group has set a high bar for sustainability with the vehicle  concept, materials selection, raw materials extraction and  manufacturing of the BMW iX. The model variants available from launch  will be powered by one electric motor at the front axle and another at  the rear axle, together producing a system output of 385 kW/523 hp in  the BMW iX xDrive50 (electric power consumption combined as per WLTP:  23.0 – 19.8 kWh/100 km; CO2  emissions combined: 200 – 185 g/km as per WLTP). This performance  model from BMW M GmbH is powered by a 275 kW/374 hp six-cylinder  in-line petrol engine and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.3 seconds.The new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé: an elegant blend of dynamism    and functionality.Signature BMW driving pleasure,  sporting elegance and modern functionality come together in the new BMW    4 Series Gran Coupé. Its vehicle concept – comprising four  doors, a large tailgate, dynamically flowing lines and five full-size  seats – brings a highly distinctive character profile to the premium  reaches of the midsize class. The second generation of the BMW 4  Series Gran Coupé also makes its mark in fine style with noticeably  enhanced driving dynamics, a sharper design in the brand’s new design  language, a refined premium ambience in the cabin and a wide array of  innovations in the areas of control/operation and connectivity. Five  model variants will be available from launch, developing between  135 kW/184 hp and 275 kW/374 hp.The new BMW X3 and new BMW X4: more sporting, more modern,    more digital.Extremely sporty looks and extensively  updated technology headline the forward-looking character of the    new BMW X3 and new BMW X4. Fresh design accents and additional  equipment features enhance the appeal of the Sports Activity Vehicle  and Sports Activity Coupé for the premium midsize class, and the new  design of the front and rear ends underlines their rugged allure. The  new BMW X4 packs extra visual punch with its exclusive BMW mesh-style  kidney grille. Standard equipment for its interior now includes  Sensatec-trimmed sport seats and three-zone automatic climate control.  And also fitted as standard are BMW Live Cockpit Plus with a  10.25-inch control display, the BMW Maps navigation system and the BMW  Intelligent Personal Assistant. The 48V mild-hybrid technology now  included with all petrol engines boosts both efficiency and dynamism.The BMW CE 04: BMW Motorrad’s silent  revolution.BMW Motorrad is taking its electric mobility  strategy for urban areas to the next level. The BMW    CE 04, for example, delivers sustainable driving pleasure on two  wheels. With an electric drive system, future-focused design and  innovative connectivity solutions, the new scooter brings twin  functionality (transport and communications) together within a single  package. With maximum output of 31 kW/42 hp, the BMW CE 04 has the  power required for spirited bursts of speed. Sophisticated battery and  charging technology enables both a range of around 130 kilometres (81  miles) and rapid replenishment of power levels. Standard specification  for the BMW CE 04 includes a cockpit with a 10.25-inch colour display,  a navigation system and extensive connectivity functions.Two enormously captivating new models mark the next steps in the BMW  Group’s ongoing electrification offensive. The BMW iX, the company’s  new technology flagship, is based on a new toolkit for the future,  whose vast potential for innovations in the areas of automated  driving, control/operation, connectivity and digital services  translates into a premium mobility experience unmatched by any other  model in this segment. It combines the proportions of a modern Sports  Activity Vehicle (SAV) with exceptional levels of interior luxury and  spaciousness. The BMW i4 brings purely electric mobility to the  premium midsize segment and therefore the very heart of the BMW brand.  The sporty yet graceful gran coupé serves up locally emission-free  driving pleasure in a dynamically compelling package, with the first  ever electrified BMW M model – the BMW i4 M50 – set to deliver a  particularly exhilarating performance experience.The BMW iX will be produced at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing and the BMW  i4 at BMW Group Plant Munich. The market launch of both models gets  underway in November 2021, meaning that the BMW i4 is making its debut  around three months earlier than originally planned.The fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology fitted in both cars  comprises a drive unit that brings together the electric motor, power  electronics and transmission within a single housing, plus  high-voltage batteries featuring the very latest cell technology,  sophisticated power electronics and the innovative Combined Charging  Unit for quick and efficient charging.The BMW iX and BMW i4 are also the first models to come with the new  generation of the iDrive display and operating system, which expands  the interaction between driver and vehicle and turns it into a natural  dialogue. It is based on BMW Operating System 8 and was designed with  a clear focus on the touchscreen operation of the BMW Curved Display  and on verbal communication with the BMW Intelligent Personal  Assistant, which also benefits from an extensive upgrade.Another shared element of these two models is a holistic approach to  sustainability that is deeply ingrained in the character of the BMW i  brand and also spans the entire supply chain. The BMW Group  self-procures the cobalt and lithium required for the high-voltage  batteries from monitored sources and then supplies them to the battery  cell manufacturers. The design principle underpinning the electric  motors avoids the need to use rare earth metals for the drive unit’s  rotors. Both the cars themselves and the battery cells will be  manufactured using green power across the board. Resource-efficient  production is further aided by the use of a high proportion of  secondary raw materials and recycled materials. In addition,  FSC-certified wood, leather tanned with olive leaf extracts and other  natural materials can also be found in the cabin of the BMW iX. The  raw materials used for manufacturing the floor coverings and mats  include recycled fishing nets.BMW iX: electric all-wheel drive, well-balanced driving  characteristics.The BMW iX model variants available  from launch are equipped with an electric motor at both the front and  rear axle, creating an electric all-wheel-drive system. The motors  generate a combined output of 385 kW/523 hp in the BMW iX xDrive50,  enabling it to sprint to 100 km/h (62 mph) from rest in 4.6 seconds.  The drive system in the BMW iX xDrive40 puts maximum output of  240 kW/326 hp on tap and propels the car from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph)  in 6.1 seconds. An even more powerful BMW M model is set to join the  line-up at a later date.The efficient powertrain technology and high energy density of the  high-voltage batteries result in sufficient operating range for  long-distance journeys; the WLTP-calculated figures are up to  630 kilometres (391 miles) for the BMW iX xDrive50 and up to  425 kilometres (264 miles) for the BMW iX xDrive40.The body structure, design principle and chassis tuning of the BMW iX  are geared to providing both superb ride comfort and sporty handling.  Thanks to its well-balanced driving characteristics, the iX feels  solid and comfortable on the road, yet also exudes fleet-footed  agility. The aluminium spaceframe construction and the Carbon Cage’s  use of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) in the roof, flanks and  rear serve to minimise weight. A raft of aerodynamics measures helps  to achieve a Cd of 0.25. The electric all-wheel drive is  combined with fast-acting and precise near-actuator wheel slip  limitation. The chassis technology can be upgraded as an option by  adding two-axle air suspension, Integral Active Steering or Sport brakes.Innovative driver assistance systems, luxurious interior  ambience.The BMW iX comes with the most extensive  spread of driver assistance systems ever fitted as standard on a BMW,  along with a wealth of extra innovations. The front collision warning  system, for instance, now detects oncoming traffic when turning left  (in countries where vehicles drive on the right) as well as cyclists  and pedestrians when turning right.The BMW iX has been designed comprehensively from the inside out. Its  interior has been created to provide quality of life and personal  well-being. Vast amounts of room and newly developed seats with  integral head restraints set the tone for the luxurious ambience. The  absence of a centre tunnel creates extra legroom, plus sufficient  space for storage areas and a centre console designed in the style of  a high-quality piece of furniture.On the outside, the clearly structured, reduced design language, the  imposing body styling and the numerous precisely crafted details bring  the progressive interpretation of luxury to the fore. One of the  highlights of the body design is the almost completely blanked off BMW  kidney grille, whose surface is the product of innovative  manufacturing techniques and incorporates camera and radar sensors.BMW i4: smile-inducing driving dynamics, exceptional design  coherence.The BMW i4 is the brand’s first fully  electric model to have been expressly designed to deliver dynamic  performance from the outset. It will be launched with a choice of two  model variants. The drive system in the BMW i4 M50 comprises electric  motors at both the front and rear axle with a combined maximum output  of 400 kW/544 hp, enabling the BMW M model to race from 0 to 100 km/h  (62 mph) in 3.9 seconds. At the same time, it achieves a range of up  to 521 kilometres (324 miles) in the WLTP test cycle. In the BMW i4  eDrive40, meanwhile, a 250 kW/340 hp electric motor teams up with  classical rear-wheel drive. It completes the 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph)  sprint in 5.7 seconds and posts a WLTP-calculated range of up to  591 kilometres (367 miles).The compact drive units are mounted to their respective axle  subframes by an elastic bearing. The extremely slim high-voltage  battery with a cell height of just 110 millimetres is located low down  in the vehicle floor, where it is fixed to an aluminium shear panel  and the front axle subframe. The weight-optimised body with high  torsional rigidity, a Cd of 0.24, the long wheelbase and  wide tracks provide an ideal platform for delivering the sporting  prowess for which BMW is renowned, combined with excellent  long-distance comfort. In addition, the BMW i4 boasts a degree of  design coherence its rivals cannot match. It is far more than just a  powerful electric car capable of accelerating rapidly in a straight  line. Indeed, making effortless progress at all times, even in  extremely demanding situations, is also part of its performance  repertoire, as is precisely controllable handling. This is enabled not  only by a vehicle concept majoring in sporting flair, but also by the  integrated application of all powertrain and chassis components.The sophisticated chassis technology present in the BMW i4 as  standard includes lift-related dampers, an integrated braking system,  rear air suspension and near-actuator wheel slip limitation. The BMW  i4 M50 turns things up another notch, featuring adaptive M suspension  with bespoke tuning, variable sport steering, M Sport brakes and M  light-alloy wheels – optionally available in sizes up to 20 inches –  with mixed-size tyres.Dynamism, elegance and modern functionality.The  BMW i4 combines the hallmark sporting elegance of the brand’s coupés  with the comfort of a four-door car and modern functionality. The  tailgate opens wide to reveal a luggage compartment with a capacity of  470 – 1,290 litres. Inside, the cabin’s dominant features are the  driver-focused cockpit, luxurious premium ambience and generously  sized, variable-use space on offer. Acoustic glazing and a pre-heating  and pre-conditioning function are included as standard, along with  sport seats and a Sport leather steering wheel. A range of  customisation options beyond any segment rival further underlines the  car’s premium character.Around 40 assistance functions designed to enhance comfort and safety  are either fitted in the BMW i4 as standard or available as options.  Highlights here include Active Cruise Control with automatic Speed  Limit Assist, route monitoring and (in Germany) traffic light  recognition, as well as the Steering and Lane Control Assistant.The character of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé is rooted in a  particularly concentrated distillation of the Bavarian carmaker’s  signature driving pleasure. The new edition of the two-door model  excites with dynamic performance that comfortably outstrips that of  its predecessor and is vividly expressed by a further example of the  new and extremely clear BMW design language at work. A fresh, youthful  and extrovert aura is complemented by thoroughly engineered and  perfectly balanced driving attributes. Thanks to a vehicle concept  geared squarely to maximising sporting allure, the new BMW 2 Series  Coupé delivers an emotionally rich driving experience with  segment-leading performance. Credit here goes to both its classical  rear-wheel drive and the presence of a six-cylinder in-line engine – a  unique proposition in this segment.The new 2 Series Coupé builds on a long tradition of compact and  extremely sporty cars sharing the number 2 in the model badge. One of  its most legendary ancestors is the BMW 2002 turbo, which became the  first series-produced European car with a turbocharged engine at  launch in 1973.When the market launch of the new 2 Series Coupé gets underway at the  beginning of 2022, customers will be able to choose from three engines  with BMW TwinPower Turbo technology. The BMW M240i xDrive Coupé (fuel  consumption combined: 8.8 – 8.1 l/100 km [32.1 – 34.9 mpg imp] in WLTP  cycle, CO2 emissions combined: 200 – 185 g/km in WLTP  cycle) is powered by a 275 kW/374 hp six-cylinder in-line engine. This  will be joined by the new BMW 220i Coupé (fuel consumption combined:  6.8 – 6.3 l/100 km [41.5 – 44.8 mpg imp] in WLTP cycle; CO2  emissions combined: 155 – 144 g/km in WLTP cycle) with a 135 kW/184 hp  four-cylinder petrol unit and the new BMW 220d Coupé (fuel consumption  combined: 5.1 – 4.7 l/100 km [55.4 – 60.1 mpg imp] in WLTP cycle;  CO2 emissions combined: 132 – 122 g/km in WLTP cycle),  whose four-cylinder diesel engine develops maximum output of  140 kW/190 hp and hooks up with 48V mild-hybrid technology. All the  engines work in tandem with an eight-speed Steptronic transmission as standard.Sophisticated chassis with technology carried over from the  BMW 4 Series.Exceptionally sophisticated chassis  components originally designed for the BMW 4 Series ensure supreme  driveability. The two-joint spring strut front axle and five-link rear  axle have been engineered to reduce weight while increasing rigidity.  Lift-related dampers are fitted as standard for sportier handling and  superior ride comfort.M Sport suspension incorporating variable sport steering can be  specified as an option and also provides the basis for the  model-specific set-up of the new BMW M240i xDrive Coupé. The  range-topping model also comes as standard with an M Sport braking  system and an M Sport differential at the rear axle, while adaptive M  suspension is available as an option.Individual proportions, athletic forms.Powerful  proportions set within the classical three-box design of bonnet,  passenger compartment and boot signal the dynamic potential of the new  2 Series Coupé. Its athletically sculpted surfaces and dynamic lines  represent the visual expression of pure driving pleasure.The horizontal BMW kidney grille features vertically arranged air  flaps in place of the classical bars. The standard full-LED headlights  are positioned at the outer extremities of the front end. Inspired by  the legendary BMW 02 models, they have an individual, circular design.Sporting flair in the interior, innovative driver assistance    systems, advanced digitalisation.The driver-focused  cockpit design and the modern control panel in the centre console  heighten the pervasive sense of sporting flair in the interior of the  new BMW 2 Series Coupé. Sport seats and a Sport leather steering wheel  both come as standard.The new BMW 2 Series Coupé enhances safety and comfort with a  significantly expanded selection of driver assistance systems over the  predecessor model.

The cloud-based BMW Maps  navigation system is included as part of the BMW Live Cockpit Plus and  BMW Live Cockpit Professional options. A variety of advanced digital  services are also available, including the BMW Intelligent Personal  Assistant and Remote Software Upgrades.Signature BMW driving pleasure and sporting elegance brought together  with modern functionality: the new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé is poised  to build on the success of its predecessor with this blend of  qualities plus well-conceived enhancements to its inherent attributes  and product substance. Like its freshly updated BMW 4 Series siblings,  the third body variant in the range also makes its mark with notably  improved driving dynamics, sharper looks in keeping with the brand’s  new design language, a refined premium ambience in the cabin and a  wide array of innovations in the areas of control/operation and  connectivity. Four doors, five full-size seats, a large, wide-opening  tailgate and a versatile luggage compartment also help to ensure the  new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé retains its characteristic strengths both  in everyday driving and on longer trips.The new edition of the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé will be built at BMW  Group Plant Munich together with the all-electric BMW i4. Market  launch will get underway in November 2021 with a choice of a  high-performance model from BMW M GmbH and four other model variants.  The new BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupé (fuel consumption combined: 8.5 –  8.0 l/100 km [33.2 – 35.3 mpg imp] in WLTP cycle; CO2  emissions combined: 193 – 181 g/km in WLTP cycle) is powered by a  275 kW/374 hp six-cylinder in-line petrol engine. The launch line-up  is completed by four-cylinder petrol and diesel models producing  outputs ranging from 135 kW/184 hp up to 180 kW/245 hp. 48V  mild-hybrid technology has been employed to give a further boost to  the dynamism and efficiency of both the straight-six petrol engine and  the diesel units. All the engines channel their power via an  eight-speed Steptronic transmission as standard.Dynamically stretched coupé lines, versatile  interior.Distinctive proportions and dynamically  stretched lines combine to give the new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé its  standalone appearance in the premium midsize segment. Larger exterior  dimensions compared with its predecessor, a longer wheelbase and wider  tracks endow the car with a greater sense of presence, sportier  performance and improved ride comfort.Sport seats and a Sport leather steering wheel are fitted as  standard. The cabin’s dynamic styling is further emphasised by  features such as knee pads on the centre console in the  BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupé and models in M Sport specification. The  model-specific body concept of the new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé enables  a versatile interior offering generous amounts of space in the rear.  The luggage compartment can be increased in size from 470 to a maximum  of 1,290 litres.Bespoke chassis set-up, wide choice of driver assistance  systems.The model-specific geometry, mounting and  set-up of the chassis technology in the new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé  are key to its sublime dynamics. Lift-related dampers are included  with both the standard chassis and the optional M Sport suspension.  There is also the option of adaptive M suspension with electronically  controlled dampers. The two optional suspension variants come with the  added benefit of variable sport steering. The standard equipment  roster for the new BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupé includes 18-inch  M light-alloy wheels, bespoke suspension tuning, M Sport brakes and an  M Sport differential with electronically controlled, fully variable  locking function at the rear axle.Around 40 assistance functions designed to facilitate comfortable and  safe driving and parking are either fitted as standard in the new  BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé or included on the options list. Highlights  here include Active Cruise Control with automatic Speed Limit Assist,  route monitoring and (in Germany) traffic light recognition, as well  as the Steering and Lane Control Assistant.Both driver and passengers will benefit from the increased  possibilities opened up by BMW Operating System 7, which comes as  standard. The optional BMW Live Cockpit Professional features a fully  digital screen grouping of 12.3-inch instrument cluster and 10.25-inch  control display, as well as the cloud-based BMW Maps navigation  system. A variety of highly advanced digital services are also  available. The standard smartphone integration feature allows Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto to be accessed via the car’s operating  system. And the Remote Software Upgrades function enables improved  vehicle functions and additional digital services to be imported into  the car over the air.More sporting, more modern, more digital: the new BMW X3 and new BMW  X4 are preparing to write a new chapter in their respective success  stories. Fresh design accents, additional equipment features and a  newly structured product offering enhance the appeal of the Sports  Activity Vehicle (SAV) and Sports Activity Coupé (SAC) for the premium  midsize class.The newly designed front end and revised rear emphasise the robust  off-road appearance and sporting looks of the two models even more  clearly. Now more visually striking (in its upper section, in  particular), the BMW kidney grille is also larger than before and has  a single-piece frame. The headlights – around ten millimetres slimmer  than previously – can now also be specified as an option with BMW  Laserlight. The exclusive BMW mesh-style kidney grille brings a  distinctive flourish to the front end of the new BMW X4.A modern interior with new equipment features and an updated  infotainment offering round off the update measures. A classily  designed control panel on the centre console, a standard-fitted  10.25-inch control display, an expanded selection of driver assistance  systems and innovative digital services mark out the forward-looking  character of the two models. The substantially upgraded standard  specification now also includes sport seats with new-generation  Sensatec covers, new Ray graining, and perforated main seat surfaces,  plus three-zone automatic climate control.The newly structured product offering redoubles its focus on sporting  appeal and rugged versatility. High-quality exterior and interior  elements in the BMW X model family mould have been added to the range  of standard equipment for the new BMW X3 and new BMW X4. As an  alternative, an M Sport package is also available for both models. At  the top end of the respective model line-ups are exceptionally  powerful performance machines from BMW M GmbH with bespoke  specification and either a petrol or diesel engine under the bonnet.48V mild-hybrid technology now for all  engines.Both the new BMW X3 and new BMW X4 can be  ordered with a choice of three petrol and three diesel engines  developing between 135 kW/184 hp and 265 kW/360 hp. All the petrol  engines now also team up with 48V mild-hybrid technology, ensuring an  optimised balance between driving pleasure and fuel economy. Even more  efficient is the plug-in hybrid BMW X3 xDrive30e (combined fuel  consumption, weighted: 2.6 – 2.0 l/100 km [108.6 – 141.2 mpg imp] as  per WLTP; combined electric power consumption, weighted:  20.5 – 18.9 kWh/100 km as per WLTP; combined CO2 emissions,  weighted: 59 – 45 g/km as per WLTP) with a system output of  215 kW/292 hp. All the drive systems channel their power to the road  via an eight-speed Steptronic transmission and BMW xDrive intelligent  all-wheel drive.Extensive updates also introduced for the BMW X3 M and BMW X4 M.BMW M GmbH has also introduced a comprehensive upgrade for its  high-performance SAV and SAC in the premium midsize class. As well as  new design features, M-specific changes and a new operating concept,  the new BMW X3 M Competition (combined fuel consumption:  11.0 – 10.8 l/100 km [25.7 – 26.2 mpg imp] as per WLTP; combined  CO2 emissions: 250 – 246 g/km as per WLTP) and new  BMW X4 M Competition (combined fuel consumption: 10.8 – 10.7 l/100 km  [26.2 – 26.4 mpg imp] as per WLTP; combined CO2 emissions:  247 – 238 g/km as per WLTP) also serve up even greater pulling power.  Alongside the larger BMW kidney grille and slimmer headlights, the now  even more expressive design of the M-specific front apron represents a  particularly prominent element of the cars’ muscular appearance.The 375 kW/510 hp six-cylinder in-line engine powering the  BMW X3 M Competition and BMW X4 M Competition now uses a forged  lightweight crankshaft and generates peak torque of 650 Nm (479 lb-ft)  – an increase of 50 Nm (37 lb-ft). Optimised power delivery allows the  two models to sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.8 seconds, which  is 0.3 seconds quicker than before.BMW Motorrad is taking its electric mobility strategy for urban areas  to the next level. The BMW CE 04, for example, delivers sustainable  driving pleasure on two wheels. With an electric drive system,  future-focused design and innovative connectivity solutions, the new  scooter brings twin functionality (transport and communications)  together within a single package. And in the process it sets new  standards in its segment in terms of design and technology.Like the BMW CE 04, all new models from BMW Motorrad designed for  urban mobility will in future run on electric power alone. Here, the  brand benefits from its integration into the BMW Group;" BMW Motorrad  is unique among motorcycle manufacturers in its ability to call on  experience and knowhow from the car sector in the development of  electric models.Powerful drive system, long range.The new BMW  CE 04 has a permanent magnet electric motor mounted in the frame  between the battery and the rear wheel, as used in a similar form in  BMW cars with a plug-in hybrid system. The new BMW CE 04 has a  powerful motor developing maximum output of 31 kW/42 hp and is a lot  of fun to ride. It needs just 2.6 seconds for the classic “traffic  light start” from 0 to 50 km/h (31 mph). And even in the reduced  output L3e-A1 class it is a lively performer, with 23 kW/31 hp on tap.  The maximum speed of both versions is 120 km/h (75 mph), enabling  speedy progress not only in the city but on main roads and motorways, too.The cell capacity of the battery in the new BMW CE 04 is ample, at  60.6 Ah (8.9 kWh). This is sufficient for a range of some 130  kilometres / 81 miles (reduced output version: 100 km / 62 miles). The  lithium-ion battery is charged via the integrated charging unit at  either a regular household socket, a Wallbox or a public charging  point. When the battery is completely flat, it takes four hours and 20  minutes to replenish. The optional rapid charger – with an output of  up to 6.9 kW – cuts the charging time to just one hour and 40 minutes  from empty.Suspension providing excellent directional stability, standard    slip control, brakes with BMW Motorrad ABS, four riding  modes.The main frame of the BMW CE 04 is a tubular  steel construction. The front wheel is controlled by a telescopic fork  with a slider tube diameter of 35 millimetres. Rear wheel control  consists of a single-sided swing arm. At the rear, suspension and  damping are via a directly controlled, fully covered spring strut  located on the left-hand side.The standard Automatic Stability Control (ASC) limits engine torque  in relation to rear wheel slip. Dynamic Traction Control (DTC),  available as an option, delivers even greater riding safety. At the  front, a twin disc brake provides secure deceleration, supported by a  single-disc system at the rear. In addition, BMW Motorrad ABS ensures  a high level of active safety. ABS Pro with a banking sensor can be  specified as an option.To satisfy individual preferences for more riding fun or extra  efficiency, the new BMW CE 04 features three riding modes as standard:  “ECO”, “Rain” and “Road”. The additional “Dynamic” mode is available  as an ex-factory option, enabling the scooter to accelerate at an even  swifter pace.Cockpit with 10.25-inch colour display, trailblazing  design.Standard specification for the BMW CE 04  includes a cockpit with a 10.25-inch colour display, a navigation  system and extensive connectivity functions. Its excellent  readability, clear menu navigation and highly integrated operating  concept put the new BMW CE 04 at the top of the scooter segment.The new BMW CE 04 embodies a new, forward-looking form of urban  two-wheeled mobility in its design as well. Its innovative style  sparks positive emotions towards this new drive technology, while  instantly identifying the scooter as a member of the BMW Motorrad  family. The modern surface work, the Light White / matt black paint  finish, a “floating” seat, wheels in a disc-wheel look and a side  stand integrated into the scooter’s modern styling headline the  visually expressive and future-focused appearance of the new BMW CE 04.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Walkenhorst Motorsport sets sights on overall victory in the Ardennes – Demo laps for the new BMW M4 GT3.;Sights set on overall victory, whilst looking ahead to the future: BMW M Motorsport is focussing on two main sporting priorities at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). In the race, Walkenhorst Motorsport, armed with the BMW M6 GT3 and a host of BMW works drivers, will be out to claim the team’s second overall victory, having previously won in 2018. The new BMW M4 GT3 will complete a number of demo laps after Superpole on Friday. ;Munich. Sights set on overall victory, whilst looking ahead to    the future: BMW M Motorsport is focussing on two main sporting    priorities at the highlight of this season’s FANATEC GT World    Challenge Europe, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). In the    race, Walkenhorst Motorsport, armed with the BMW M6 GT3 and a host    of BMW works drivers, will be out to claim the team’s second overall    victory, having previously won in 2018. The new BMW M4 GT3 will    complete a number of demo laps after Superpole on Friday. Not only    will the car be presented, but also the hybrid steering wheel,    developed in collaboration with FANATEC. The flood disaster in    Germany and Belgium is another important topic. Among other things,    the BMW Group is donating 1.5 million euros to support the rescue    services in the disaster areas. As an expression of sympathy, the    BMW race cars at Spa-Francorchamps will bear the message ‘We stand together’. As in the races already completed in this season’s Endurance Cup – at  Monza (ITA) and Le Castellet (FRA) – Marco Wittmann (GER), Sheldon van  der Linde (RSA) and David Pittard (GBR) will compete in the #34 BMW M6  GT3 for Walkenhorst Motorsport. Timo Glock, Martin Tomczyk (both GER)  and Thomas Neubauer (FRA) will share the wheel of the #35 car. Both  crews recently finished in the top ten in the 1000 km of Paul Ricard.  The team receives support from BMW M Motorsport partners Akrapovič,  BMW M Performance Parts, CATL, MultiBank Group, and Shell with the  running of both cars. Spa-Francorchamps was the scene of Walkenhorst Motorsport’s greatest  success so far. The team from Melle (GER) took overall victory in  2018. Three years prior to that, Glock was among those who caused  quite a stir when he shared the driving duties in a BMW Z4 GT3,  sporting a Michel Vaillant look, with Bruno Spengler (CAN) and BMW  brand ambassador Alessandro Zanardi (ITA). Thanks to BMW M Motorsport  Team Boutsen Ginion Racing, this year’s starting grid will again  feature a BMW car with a Michel Vaillant design. In the Pro-Am Cup,  BMW works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) races alongside Karim Ojjeh  (KSA), Jens Liebhauser (GER) and Yann Zimmer (SUI) in the #10 BMW M6 GT3. Glock and Klingmann will play a main role in a joint show event, put  on by BMW M Motorsport and series partner FANATEC after Friday  evening’s Superpole. The two BMW works drivers will complete a number  of demo laps in the new BMW M4 GT3, during which they will demonstrate  the globally unique feature of the steering wheel. It was designed to  be used in both a real race car and a race simulator. To showcase  this, Glock and Klingmann will use the identical steering wheel in  both the car’s cockpit and a simulator. The BMW M4 GT3, which caused people to sit up and take notice a few  weeks ago with the best time at the official tests at  Spa-Francorchamps, will be on display in the paddock all weekend. From  2022, the BMW M Motorsport teams will do battle for victories and  titles around the world with the new GT flagship. Quotes ahead of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps: Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “This 24-hour  race is particularly poignant given the catastrophic flooding we have  experienced, some of which has been very close to the Nürburgring and  Spa-Francorchamps racetracks which we all love so much. Our thoughts  are with all those suffering as a result of the floods. From a  sporting point of view, our goal is to bid farewell to the BMW M6 GT3  by adding another success to the outstanding record it has enjoyed at  Spa-Francorchamps in the past. The car took overall victory in 2016  and 2018, and I am confident that Walkenhorst Motorsport can play a  major role again this year. Furthermore, we are heralding the era of  the new BMW M4 GT3 with a number of demonstration laps. It gave an  indication of what sort of speed it is capable of a few weeks ago, at  the official tests, even if that was without any opposition and in a  classification of its own. We are looking forward to a varied weekend.” Niclas Königbauer (Team Manager Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “This weekend, we return to the scene of the  Walkenhorst Motorsport team’s greatest success to date. We know that  the BMW M6 GT3 is strong at this circuit, and want to mix it at the  front of the field again in the car’s final race at Spa-Francorchamps.  We have fantastic drivers, who are definitely capable of challenging  for the podium, and hopefully even the win.” Sheldon van der Linde (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “I’m really looking forward to racing at Spa  together with Marco Wittmann and David Pittard and trying to win again  for Walkenhorst Motorsport, who have shown before how strong the team  and the BMW M6 GT3 are on that track. I think it would be the perfect  farewell for the car in its last year. We had strong pace in the last  race at Le Castellet but couldn’t bring it home so we have some  unfinished business. I would love to win this race, after having  finished third there in 2018 – behind two BMW M6 GT3s…” Timo Glock (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “I am really looking forward to driving in the  24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps again, having appeared alongside  Alex Zanardi and Bruno Spengler last time out at this event.  Unfortunately, on that occasion we only managed 23.5 hours instead of  24. As such, our goal for this year is obviously to finish the race –  and, if possible, in a good position. It is a very special race. The  circuit is simply outstanding, and Spa-Francorchamps always guarantees  good racing. For this reason, I am looking forward to taking on the  race together with Martin Tomczyk, Thomas Neubauer and Walkenhorst  Motorsport. I am excited to see how it plays out, and am looking  forward to the challenge of the 24 Hours of Spa.” Jens Klingmann (#10 BMW M6 GT3, Boutsen Ginion  Racing): “For me, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps is the  biggest GT3 race in the world, with more than 60 cars in the starting  line-up. Together with Boutsen Ginion Racing and my fellow drivers in  the Pro-Am class, I will be striving to finish for the family, even if  the class is a very strong one. I am also really looking forward to  the show run in the BMW M4 GT3. It is a great honour to present the  car to the fans and the other teams on this occasion.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Welt hosts One Young World Summit; More than 2,000 young professionals from over 190 countries  High-profile guests from business, politics, society, sport and culture  Participants aim to take joint responsibility and find solutions;Munich, 27 July 2021 – More than 2,000 young  professionals from over 190 countries came together over the weekend  both physically and virtually at the One Young World (OYW) Summit to  discuss global social challenges and opportunities for sustainable  business, with the goal of working together to find solutions. The theme of this year’s summit was “Innovation”, as applied to  topics such as the climate crisis, freedom and civil rights, and  education. A number of high-profile guests from the worlds of  business, politics, society, sport and culture provided the young  people with advice and inspiration, among them Nobel Peace Prize  winner Professor Muhammad Yunus, singer and activist Bob Geldof, and  former footballer Hope Solo. More than 60 BMW Group delegates from  locations around the world were selected to attend the OYW Summit in Munich. “Working at the BMW Group means taking responsibility”As a longstanding supporter of OYW, the BMW Group took advantage of  its role as this year’s co-host to encourage participants to seek  solutions and push for needed changes with their own ideas and  projects. “Each and every one of us can play a part in making the  economy more sustainable. And I have a good reason for being confident  that we can achieve this enormous transformation: namely, our  employees,” noted Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management  of BMW AG responsible for Human Resources and an OYW Counsellor, at  the big closing ceremony on Sunday at BMW Welt. “The reason for my  optimism is employees like Evelin Hartmann and Florian Kantop,”  Horstmeier added. The two talented young people from the MINI design  team and the seat development department set themselves the goal of  finding a sustainable and recyclable alternative to leather seat  covers. With the help of their colleagues, they developed a design  concept for a 100 percent recyclable seat cover that produces over 99  percent less CO2 emissions than conventional leather covers. “Along  with seats, our teams are also taking a closer look at vehicle  components such as the floor trim, trunk and headliner. There is  plenty of potential there!” promised the two when presenting their  project on the OYW stage at BMW Welt. The BMW Group’s other OYW delegates have likewise recognised this  potential – and, in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable  Development Goals, are also helping to make the world a little better  through their projects. They collect and recycle PVC scraps from  manufacturing, make backpacks and toilet bags from old factory  uniforms, and support schools in South Africa with solar energy  storage units made from used high-voltage batteries. “It’s up to us to take responsibility”“It’s up to us to take responsibility,” says Ilka Horstmeier.  Thinking hard about the future and actively shaping it today is thus  not only the guiding principle of the OYW organisation but is also  strongly anchored in the consciousness of the BMW Group.  Far-sightedness and social responsibility can even be called hallmarks  of the BMW Group. This also includes offering committed young  professionals a platform for complex and constructive discussions  about solutions for the future. “We must strive to develop a common  image of our society – as a people-centred society that balances  solutions to environmental and social problems with economic  progress,” according to Horstmeier. The four-day One Young World Summit is held in a different city each  year. The host city in 2022 will be Tokyo. Please contact us if you have any queries:Corporate CommunicationsAngela Konert, BMW Group, Spokesperson Human ResourcesPhone: +49-89-382-50591, angela.konert@bmw.deMarkus Sagemann, BMW Group, Head of Communications Human Resources,  Corporate CitizenshipPhone: +49-89-382-68796, markus.sagemann@bmw.de The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

BMW M Motorsport News, 26th July 2021.;BMW M Motorsport teams are once again in action all over the world in 2021. They are challenging for race wins and titles with the BMW M6 GT3, the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW M2 CS Racing, and other BMW M Motorsport race cars. Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you an overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams.;DTM: Pole position for the BMW M6 GT3 at the Lausitzring. Round two of the season in the new DTM: This weekend, the Lausitzring  (GER) hosted the GT3 series in glorious summery conditions. Sheldon  van der Linde (RSA) secured the first pole position in the DTM for the  BMW M6 GT3. The ROWE Racing driver set the fastest time in qualifying  on Saturday morning. Van der Linde then led for much of Saturday’s  race in the #31 BMW M6 GT3, before eventually finishing third.  However, he was subsequently handed a time penalty for a moment of  carelessness from the pit crew, which saw him relegated to ninth  place. The best-placed BMW M6 GT3 on Saturday was the #11 Walkenhorst  Motorsport car, driven by Marco Wittmann (GER), who came home seventh.  Wittmann climbed seven positions from 14th on the grid. Timo Glock  (GER) struggled with tyre wear before finishing eleventh in the #16  ROWE Racing BMW M6 GT3. Glock was then the best-placed BMW driver in Sunday’s qualifying,  securing fifth place on the grid. Van der Linde started the race from  seventh place, with Wittmann again 14th. In race two on Sunday, van  der Linde came home fifth, just ahead of Wittmann who produced another  impressive fightback to finish sixth. Glock twice ended up in the  gravel during a hectic start to the race, and fell well back down the  field as a result. He eventually crossed the finish line in 13th place. The third race weekend of the 2021 season will take place at Zolder,  Belgium, from 6th to 8th August. --DTM Trophy: Three podiums for the BMW M4 GT4 in Lusatia. There was another strong display from the BMW M Motorsport teams at  the second event of this season’s DTM Trophy at the Lausitzring (GER).  Seven BMW M4 GT4s finished in the top ten in Saturdays race, with that  figure rising to eight on Sunday. Spearheading the BMW contingent was  Ben Green (GBR) in the #10 BMW M4 GT4, who was runner-up in both races  for the FK Performance Motorsport team. In race two on Sunday, Green  was joined on the podium by Michael Schrey (GER) in the #2 BMW M4 GT4  of Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport. Green, who had started the season with a victory in the opening race  at Monza (ITA) back in June, was once again in contention for the top  step of the podium in both races. In race one, he missed out on the  win by less than half a second, crossing the finish line in second  place. Race two was even closer. Green led at times before eventually  finishing just three-tenths of a second behind the winning car. In the  championship standings, Green is currently second after four races.  Schrey, who won race two of the season at Monza and added another  podium at the Lausitzring, is third in the Drivers’ Championship. In  the Team competition, FK Performance Motorsport is currently second,  ahead of Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport. --BMW M2 Cup: New racing series makes its debut at the Lausitzring. The new BMW M2 Cup made its debut during the DTM weekend at the  Lausitzring (GER). The new series features spectacular racing with the  BMW M2 CS Racing. 17 cars were in action at the season-opener in the  Lusatia region of Germany. The dominant driver on the inaugural weekend of the BMW M2 Cup was  Tim Heinemann (GER), who secured both pole positions in the #78 BMW M2  CS Racing and went on to claim comfortable lights-to-flag victories in  both races. In Saturday’s opening race, Heinemann finished almost nine  seconds ahead of his closest rivals. In race two on Sunday, his lead  was over four seconds. Runner-up in race one was Fabian Kreim (GER /  #43). In race two, second place went to 16-year-old Salman Owega (GER  / #7). The third place on the podium in both races was occupied by  Louis Henkefend (GER) in the #17 BMW M2 CS Racing. The second event of the season takes place from 6th to 8th August at  Zolder, Belgium. More information on the BMW M2 Cup can be found on  the official website bmwm2cup.com.

The competitors in the IMSA WeatherTech  Championship and the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge had an eventful  race weekend at times. On Friday, unsettled weather presented a real  challenge for the teams. In GTD qualifying in the IMSA WeatherTech  Championship, the #96 Turner Motorsport BMW M6 GT3 finished seventh.  The only way was up for drivers Bill Auberlen and Robby Foley (both  USA) in the Saturday race, which was scheduled to last two hours and  40 minutes. However, an intense thunderstorm forced the race to be  suspended after 90 minutes, and it was never re-started. That left  Auberlen/Foley in fifth place. They currently lie second in the  Drivers’ Championship. Friday’s qualifying for the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge was  shortened following a crash. Auberlen qualified second in the #95  Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT4, which he shares with Dillon Machavern  (USA). In the two-hour race on Saturday, a technical issue resulted in  the duo dropping well down the field. They eventually finished 16th in  the GS class. Foley and Vincent Barletta (USA) were eighth in class in  the #96 BMW M4 GT4. The AutoTechnic Racing team competed with the #52  BMW M4 GT4, driven by Attilio Albani and Elivan Goulart (both USA).  They came home eleventh in the GS class. Auberlen and Machavern  continue to lead the GS standings, but are now tied at the top of the standings. --British GT Championship: Leaders Century Motorsport on the    podium at Spa-Francorchamps. The British GT Championship was in Belgium at the weekend, where  Spa-Francorchamps hosted round four of the 2021 season. It was another  successful weekend for the Century Motorsport team – despite the  additional weight the team had to bear as a result of its brace of  victories at round three at Donington (GBR). Gus Burton and Will Burns  (both GBR) in the #57 BMW M4 GT4 secured pole position in a  hard-fought qualifying session on Saturday. The two-hour race on  Sunday was an eventful one. In the end, Burton/Mills finished third  overall in the GT4 class and second in the Silver class. Their  team-mates Andrew Gordon-Coldbrooke and Chris Salkeld (both GBR) gave  a courageous fightback in the #9 BMW M4 GT4. Having dropped through  the field following a drive-through penalty, they recovered strongly  to finish fifth overall and fourth in the Silver class.    In the GT4 Drivers’ standings in the British GT Championship, Burton  and Burns still hold a commanding lead with 111.5 points. They are  followed in second place by Gordon-Coldbrooke and Salkeld with 81  points. Burton/Burns also lead the Silver class, with  Gordon-Coldbrooke/Salkeld the top pair in the Pro-Am competition. In  the GT4 Team standings, Century Motorsport are top with 196.5 points  and a seemingly-unassailable lead of 132 points. --Super GT Championship: Round four at Motegi. The Japanese Super GT Championship held its fourth round of the  season at Motegi (JPN) in mid-July. In the thick of the action was BMW  Team Studie with the #7 BMW M6 GT3, driven by Seiji Ara and Tomohide  Yamaguchi (both JPN). The summery heat, with temperatures reaching 33  degrees Celsius, made for challenging conditions. In Saturday’s  qualifying, the #7 was the fastest Pro-Am car and finished 13th  overall. However, the team then had to retire from Sunday’s race due  to a technical issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Julien Creuzet starts BMW Art Journey 2021.  Artist based in France searches for the unexpected among the familiar roots of his ancestors in Martinique.;BMW Art Journey winner 2021 Julien Creuzet, represented by High Art, Paris, started the first part of his BMW Art Journey on July 15, 2021. In Martinique, he will explore the unexpected and surprising in the familiar environment of his ancestors. ;Munich/Basel/Paris. BMW Art Journey winner 2021  Julien Creuzet, represented by High Art, Paris, started the first part  of his BMW Art Journey on July 15, 2021. In Martinique, he will  explore the unexpected and surprising in the familiar environment of  his ancestors.The BMW Art Journey is part of BMW Group’s global cultural  engagement, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.  Committed in the fields of modern and contemporary art, classical  music, jazz and sound as well as architecture and design, the BMW  Group has been an integral part of culture on a global scale.Inspired by the Martinican thinker, critic and poet Édouard Glissant  who had written about the concept of creolization, “It is a mixture of  arts, customs and languages ​​that produces the unexpected,” Creuzet  will make five trips in total to the Antillean islands Martinique and  Guadeloupe between July 2021 and Spring 2022.Creuzet himself was raised in Martinique, but never had the chance to  work there. About his BMW Art Journey he says: “I strive to make my  contribution, to give back by offering my experience and a place, a  living world, a workstation for long-term experimentation. My journey  is related to a long-time project that I had in mind, but I was never  able to realize it. It is a good opportunity for me to return and to  re-connect with my native land. I have shown and shared my practice  and perspective around the world, but never in the land of my ancestors.”During his BMW Art Journey Julien Creuzet will focus on three  artistic projects around the geographically and culturally distinct  region of the Antilleans. Filming landscapes, underwater scenes, and  local festivals such as carnival, on the ground and with drones, he  will create a video in collaboration with local contemporary artists  and musicians.A second project is an eight months-long workshop with the art  students of Beaux-Arts de Fort-de-France (Campus Caribbean des Arts),  opening a studio for their artistic work. One focus of the workshop  will be about the creation of “bwadjacks” – sculptures made of  modified cars and materials which are usually found on scrapyards, in  a gesture of circularity.Lastly, Creuzet will work on a project with the local fauna of the  Antilleans. Drawing inspiration from natural forms, he aims to create  new hybrid sculptures recycling plastic and other materials. The  results of his BMW Art Journey are expected to be shown during Art  Basel in Hong Kong in 2022.About Julien Creuzet at High Art, ParisJulien  Creuzet (b.1986) lives and works in Montreuil, France. He creates  protean artworks incorporating poetry, music, sculpture, assemblage,  film and animation. Evoking trans-oceanic postcolonial transactions in  relation to multiple temporalities, the artist places his own  inherited past, present and future at the heart of his production.  Eluding generalized narratives and cultural reductions, Creuzet’s work  often spotlights anachronisms and social realities to construct  objects of irreducibility. Recent solo exhibitions include Camden Arts  Center, London (upcoming); Musée  d’Art moderne de Paris and Centre Pompidou, Paris. Creuzet is a  nominee for the Prix Marcel Duchamp 2021.Julien Creuzet was selected for BMW Art Journey 2021 from a shortlist  of three artists represented by galleries originally accepted into  this year’s Art Basel show in Hong Kong, in an online jury process.

Stimulating ideas for urban mobility: BMW Group Research unveils innovative concepts for cargo bike and e-scooter. ; Innovative design concepts for city-centre travel  Electrified bicycle Concept DYNAMIC CARGO promises high variability, everyday usability and sheer cycling pleasure  e-scooter Concept CLEVER COMMUTE with remarkably compact de-sign thanks to folding mechanism  ;"Munich. In recent years, there has been an increase  in traffic in many city centres, and the mobility requirements of the  people who live there remain high. In its role as a premium provider  for individual mobility, the BMW Group is actively helping to create  the liveable city of the future. Here, its approach to mobility also  looks beyond the company’s core business. The BMW Group has already  presented a number of innovative micromobility solutions to the public  in the past, including the BMW Motorrad X2City, the Personal Mover Concept and the BMW Vision E³ Way elevated road concept. With  the unveiling of the electrified bicycle Concept DYNAMIC CARGO and the  e-scooter Concept CLEVER COMMUTE, the BMW Group engineers are once  again demonstrating their unrivalled ability to transfer know-how from  the automotive sector to concepts for micromobility vehicles.Concept DYNAMIC CARGO: unexpected cycling pleasure plus    exceptional variability.Bicycles offer great flexibility of use, produce zero emissions and  are one of the fastest and most efficient means of transport in urban  areas. However, rainy, cold or slippery conditions are usually all it  takes for the majority of cyclists to switch to public transport or  their car instead. The same applies when they need to carry loads that  are too large for a standard luggage rack to handle, such as a larger  food shop, or to transport children. A wide range of cargo bikes are  now available that offer an additional alternative to using the car  for urban trips. However, many cargo bike concepts are wider and,  above all, longer than normal bicycles due to the requirements for  transporting loads and/or children. In conjunction with the resulting  additional weight and the possible payload, this leads to restrictions  of varying degrees compared to normal bicycles, particularly with  regard to driving agility and handling.""Our goal was to develop a concept that retains the agility and  driving feel of a normal bicycle while adding innovative, safe  transport options"" says Jochen Karg, Head of Vehicle Concepts in  the BMW Group's New Technologies and China division. ""The  ""Concept DYNAMIC CARGO"" is the first dynamic 'pick-up' cargo  bike that combines driving pleasure with flexible use and increased  year-round suitability.""The key component of the three-wheeled Concept DYNAMIC CARGO is the  front main frame, which is connected to the rear section via a pivot  axle and tilts in corners. The rear section remains stable through all  corners without tilting towards the road. This combines with the  electrified powertrain – which is activated as soon as the rider  starts to pedal and drives the two rear wheels – to make the cargo  bike just as easy to ride as a standard bicycle. As well as producing  far greater riding stability in all weather conditions compared to  two-wheeler designs, the rear wheels with their rigid, non-pivoting  axle mounting also provide the basis for a versatile, pick-up-style  transport platform. This can be fitted with a selection of innovative  modular attachments for carrying luggage and/or children. The modular  design principle paves the way for many more use cases, too. The  non-pivoting design of the transport platform has the additional  benefit that the rider is barely aware of any extra weight being  carried, enabling safe, stable transportation of all loads while also  ensuring a pleasurable riding experience.The concept is rounded off by a facility for adding a modular system  of weather protection. Together with the superior riding safety, which  proves especially useful in adverse weather, this makes the Concept  DYNAMIC CARGO an attractive means of transport all year round.Although the BMW Group will not manufacture the Concept DYNAMIC CARGO  itself, it is already in discussions with potential licensees.Concept CLEVER COMMUTE: the perfect companion for the “last mile”.E-scooters have firmly established themselves in the urban mobility  mix, thanks to sharing schemes in particular. They offer flexible  usability, zero local emissions and the ability to get city dwellers  to their destination extremely quickly over short “last-mile” urban  journeys. The uptake of e-scooters for private ownership has been  relatively slow to date. Robust models that can be ridden safely are  difficult to take onto public transport or carry by car due to their  size, while small, more portable models suffer from poor riding stability.With its Concept CLEVER COMMUTE, the BMW Group is now presenting an  e-scooter that folds easily for carrying on public transport and/or by  car without compromising on riding stability in any way. In public  transport mode, the footboard folds up at the sides and the rear wheel  pivots into the resulting aperture from below. This mechanism shortens  the wheelbase of the CLEVER COMMUTE substantially so that it can even  be carried on an escalator without difficulty. This is an important  requirement if the journey includes underground transport routes. It  can also be rolled along on both wheels in this mode, rather like a  trolley case. And the front wheel’s integral hub motor provides an  electric impulse that makes it easier to push the CLEVER COMMUTE up  ramps. The e-scooter’s compact dimensions when folded up means it  should be possible to take it on all forms of public transport free of charge.The CLEVER COMMUTE can be folded up to a size that fits easily into  small vehicle boots, with larger boots able to accommodate several of  them for family outings. In the BMW Group range, this means that the  CLEVER COMMUTE fits into luggage compartments lengthways from the  3 Series upwards, for example, without any need to fold down the rear  backrest, and it can be carried crossways in MINI boots.With its unique product characteristics, the CLEVER COMMUTE is a  versatile companion in the city and allows any journey to be completed  quickly, safely and easily. Its transformability makes it a truly  ideal solution for multimodal travel.Although the BMW Group will not manufacture the Concept CLEVER  COMMUTE itself, it is already in discussions with potential licensees.Both micromobility concepts have been designed in such a way that the  electric range can be scaled with regard to the respective  application. One final very important feature for city use is the  battery pack, which can be removed and charged at home.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
After victory in Saturday’s race both BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers in the points in London.;In a tumultuous Sunday race, Maximilian Günther (GER) and Jake Dennis (GBR) scored valuable points in the overall ABB FIA Formula E World Championship standings. ;London. In a tumultuous Sunday race, Maximilian Günther (GER)    and Jake Dennis (GBR) scored valuable points in the overall ABB FIA    Formula E World Championship standings. Günther had started the 13th    race of the season from sixth on the grid and crossed the line in    the same position. Dennis followed up his win at the London E-Prix    (GBR) on Saturday with a courageous recovery performance, clawing    back eight places to finish ninth, having started from 17th on the    grid. A drive-through penalty just before the end of the race put    paid to his chances of a better finish. The MINI Electric Pacesetter    inspired by JCW, the official FIA Formula E Safety Car, appeared    twice after incidents had occurred. Günther drove a commanding race after a disappointing Saturday. He  had delivered proof of his pace during the morning qualifying session,  securing a place in the Super Pole competition for the seventh time  this season. He reached sixth in the battle for grid positions,  recording a time of 1:20.398 minutes. Günther was unable to steer  clear of all the incidents as the race progressed at the London  exhibition centre, but he displayed plenty of stamina to maintain his  position to the finish line. Dennis gave another strong performance in the free practice session,  ending the session in second place as he had done on the previous day.  However, his starting position in the drivers’ standings meant that he  had to compete in qualifying group one. He was the first driver out on  the track and secured third place, before being pushed back down to  17th as the session progressed. Dennis mounted a spirited chase in the  race and spent some time ahead of Günther before being knocked back to  ninth place due to a drive-through penalty for a technical infringement. Formula E rookie Dennis is now fourth in the drivers’ standings, with  81 points. Günther is in 15th place, with 62 points. BMW i Andretti  Motorsport is fifth in the team standings with 143 points. The Season 7 finale will take place in three weeks, at the former  Berlin-Tempelhof (GER) airport. After races 14 and 15 complete the  season, one driver will be crowned world champion for the first time  in the history of Formula E. Reactions to Race 13 in London. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 5th place):“The second race here in London was much more eventful. Everyone was  a little more conservative yesterday but it was much more aggressive  today. In the end, we finished with both cars in the points.

In the Superpole race, Tom Sykes (GBR) put on a thrilling    chase to move up from 18th to seventh place. In the afternoon,    Michael van der Mark (NED) overcame difficulties during race two to    improve by five places and secure another top result by finishing    sixth. After his crash on Saturday, the race doctors did not grant    clearance for Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team Bonovo    MGM Racing to compete on Sunday. After some heavy rainfall, there was still water on and around the  circuit in the morning, causing the warm-up session to be postponed by  50 minutes. The start of the morning’s Superpole race was then also  pushed back by ten minutes. The track was then dry, but conditions  still proved to be treacherous in places. Sykes once again gave a  fantastic chase. Starting from 18th on the grid, he moved up ten  positions with his BMW M 1000 RR on the first lap and secured seventh  place on lap four. That was where he finished the sprint race,  claiming seventh spot on the grid for the afternoon’s second race. Van  der Mark also made a good start from ninth only to take a fall a short  time later. This put him eleventh on the grid for race two. At the start of the second race, two riders collided at the front in  turn one – while van der Mark was able to leap forward six places to  move into fifth. Sykes claimed seventh position on lap one, but then  fell back a little. Van der Mark also lost some time. During the  second half of the race, van der Mark and Sykes were then involved in  a duel lying in eighth and ninth places, all while closing in on the  top six. Events took a dramatic turn coming into the final lap;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Jake Dennis celebrates second win of the season for BMW i Andretti Motorsport in London.;After a tactically astute and commanding driving performance in his home race in London (GBR), Jake Dennis (GBR) has celebrated his second win in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship for BMW i Andretti Motorsport. ;London. After a tactically astute and commanding driving    performance in his home race in London (GBR), Jake Dennis (GBR) has    celebrated his second win in the ABB FIA Formula E World    Championship for BMW i Andretti Motorsport. The British driver    started the London E-Prix from second on the grid in the #27 BMW    iFE.21. He moved ahead in the opening third of the race, pulled away    from his rivals before using the second attack mode and never looked    likely to surrender the lead. Having already tasted victory at    Valencia (ESP), this is the second time that Dennis has topped the    podium in his Formula E debut season. His team-mate Maximilian    Günther (GER) crossed the finish line in 20th place.  Dennis had already given an impressive performance in the morning’s  free practice session, recording the second-fastest time behind  Günther in difficult and rainy conditions. One feature of the track  layout in particular made the session a challenging one. As one  section of the 2.252-kilometre circuit runs through the surroundings  of ExCel London and another section is located inside the halls  themselves, the drivers struggled with aquaplaning on the wet outdoor  surface, while the track inside the exhibition centre was bone dry. The course gradually dried out as the qualifying session progressed.  Both BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers were chasing the best time in  group three. Günther’s session ended early after he slammed into a  wall when braking into a corner. Dennis was right behind him and was  forced to abort his fast lap. When qualifying restarted, the British  driver was able to try again. He managed to reach the Super Pole  competition, where he secured second place on the grid that proved to  be the perfect starting point for his victorious drive. This victory sees Dennis move up to third place in the drivers’  standings. He has now scored 79 points and is just two points off the  lead. Günther is in 15th place with 54 points. BMW i Andretti  Motorsport is sixth in the team standings, with 133 points. Race 13 of the season will take place on Sunday in London as well. It  starts at 15:00 CEST (14:00 local time). Reactions to Race 12 in London. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“From Jake's point of view, it was a strong qualifying session that  put him on the front row. After a sensible start from him, he settled  into a good rhythm and then we experienced some smart driving from him  and some smart strategy calls from the engineering team. We saw the  result with Jake on the podium and massive rewards towards his  championship position. On Maximilian's side of the garage it was a  different story. What was looking like a good qualifying lap really  came to nothing with the impact into the wall. It took a big team  effort to get the car rebuilt in time for the race. Both car crews got  together and worked well. That shows the strength of the team.  Unfortunately with Maximilian starting from the back, it meant it was  going to be hard work all afternoon. He made up some positions, but  after another contact he slipped back to P20. I am looking forward to  tomorrow. Let’s see what we can do again here in London.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 2nd    place, race result: 1st place, points: 79, driver    standings: 3rd place):“I am super happy. I pretty much didn't know what to expect going  into the race. It was a little bit different to normal, with really  not much energy-saving going on.

Mixed feelings for BMW Motorrad Motorsport on WorldSBK Saturday at Assen.;BMW Motorrad Motorsport gave a strong performance in Saturday’s race at Assen (NED) to confirm the upward trend in the FIM Superbike World Championship, but a serious accident for Jonas Folger (GER) overshadowed the good results.;Assen. BMW Motorrad Motorsport gave a strong performance in    Saturday’s race at Assen (NED) to confirm the upward trend in the    FIM Superbike World Championship, but a serious accident for Jonas    Folger (GER) overshadowed the good results. Running in seventh    place, the rider from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing    crashed out just before the finish. After initial examinations in    the Medical Centre, Folger was transferred to hospital for further    checks as a precautionary measure, which he was able to leave again    in the meantime. Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad    WorldSBK Team was fourth in the first race on his home circuit. His    team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR), who started from 20th on the grid, was    classified seventh. Folger had been the fastest BMW rider after a strong performance in  the morning’s Superpole. He claimed sixth spot, on the second row of  the grid. Van der Mark finished Superpole in ninth place. Sykes  endured some back luck, as a technical issue prevented him from taking  to the track until the end of the session. He chalked up the  second-fastest time but the lap was not classified as it had begun  just a few fractions of a second too late. As Sykes’ time did not  count, he had to start from 20th on the grid. All three BMW riders gave impressively strong performances in the  race itself. At the start, Folger defended his sixth place, van der  Mark fell back for a brief period and Sykes moved up five positions  straight away. However, van der Mark sprinted quickly up through the  field, reaching fifth place on lap three. One lap later, he was in  fourth and intent on closing the gap to the leading trio. Folger held  on to sixth spot before dropping down one place on lap 16. Meanwhile,  Sykes continued to work his way up through the field from the back,  reaching eighth position. Folger, however, crashed out two laps before  the end, leading to an immediate red flag. Quotes after race one at Assen. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  most important thing is that Jonas is doing pretty well after that  fall. That was a day of mixed feelings for us. We had to switch  Michael’s engine in the morning and he was unable to participate in  the third free practice session. We had a technical problem with Tom  during qualifying. We were able to fix that and he still recorded a  fast lap, which would have been good enough for second place but the  lap was not classified as he crossed the line just shortly after the  end of the session meaning that he started from 20th on the grid.  After missing out on practice, Michael put in a good lap to secure  ninth place in qualifying. Jonas was doing really well and it was  great to see him placed so high up. At the start of the race, Michael  was pushed wide on turn one and fell back to 13th place, but he  recovered from that very quickly and finished fourth in the end, 1.2  seconds away from the podium. That was a really strong performance,  which we had not expected after this morning. Tom also rode a very  good race after starting at the back. In the second half of the race,  he was the fastest rider out there with his lap times. Starting from  sixth on the grid, Jonas was able to keep pace very well and we could  see that the work had paid off. Unfortunately, he crashed out on one  of the fastest corners on this circuit and slid under the air-fence.  We were glad to get the news that he is doing well after some initial  examinations. We will start from the same positions tomorrow but if we  produce the same level of performance in the race as we did today, we  are well set to aim for a podium finish.”   Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Both riders really showed their fighting spirit. After  having missed this morning’s FP3, Michael struggled a bit in Superpole  to make best use of his tyre so he did a really good job to put it on  the third row of the grid. Tom sadly had a technical issue, and to  miss the chequered flag by so narrowly and his lap, which would have  put him second on the grid, not counting really was cruel luck for  him. So he had to start from the back but both riders did a fantastic  job in the race. Michael lost a lot of time coming together with Lucas  Mahias in a typical first corner melee but fought back very well. I  think if it wasn’t for that he could have been in the battle for the  podium positions because finishing just a bit more of a second behind  when the red flag came out showed how much progress he had made. And  equally Tom came through very well from the grid. We will take that  result and build on that. Tomorrow is another day and overall it has  been a good job in the circumstances. I am very proud of the guys and  all the hard work they have done on and off the track. We are looking  forward to tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was a tough Saturday, to be honest. This morning, I did not do any  laps as we had a mechanical problem and so we went straight into  Superpole. We thought we can do two laps with the qualifying tyre but  I could just do one so it was quite tough. P9 on the grid wasn’t  great, and also my start was not the best. I had some wheelieing and  lost some positions there, then I got a bit of wrangling with another  rider going into turn one and the first lap wasn’t really clean, but  then straight away I had a good pace and I managed to pass some riders  one by one. At the end I had a similar pace as the guys in front of me  who were fighting for the podium but I just could not get any closer.  We need to find a little bit extra grip to have the pace so I can  battle with them.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a  little bit of a character building day. We have been unlucky in  Superpole and that set the scene for the opening race today. We had a  slight technical issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Welt Jazz Award 2022 will be following the theme “Key Position”.;At the final concert of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 held on Friday evening, the Peter Gall Quintet won over the award’s renowned jury. Together with saxophonist Wanja Slavin, Dutch guitarist Reinier Baas, pianist Reiner Böhm and up-and-coming bassist Felix Henkelhausen, drummer Peter Gall prevailed against the Adam Bałdych Quartet. ;Munich. At the final concert of the BMW Welt Jazz  Award 2020 held on Friday evening, the Peter Gall Quintet won over the  award’s renowned jury. Together with saxophonist Wanja Slavin, Dutch  guitarist Reinier Baas, pianist Reiner Böhm and up-and-coming bassist  Felix Henkelhausen, drummer Peter Gall prevailed against the dam  Bałdych Quartet. Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of  BMW AG, presented the prize together with Anton Biebl, Head of the  Department of Cultural Affairs of the state capital Munich.Following the theme “The Melody at Night”, the concerts of the BMW  Welt Jazz Award 2020 were presented at BMW Welt’s double coned  structure and for the first time on Tuesday evenings. Having been  postponed for over a year due to the global pandemic, the final  concert of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 now took place at the  philharmonic hall at Gasteig, thanks to the city of Munich.The expert jury said: “Both finalists convincingly brought the motto  ‘The Melody at Night’ of this BMW Welt Jazz Award edition to life with  a personal twist of their own. Adam Bałdych has once again proven to  be a technically and stylistically unique violinist. And the drummer  Peter Gall, who has already shown his brilliance in so many ways while  participating in the projects of others, has proven to be an  outstanding composer and great band leader with his very first work of  his own. Together with his dream team, the all-star quintet starring  Rainer Böhm, Reinier Baas, Wanja Slavin and Felix Henkelhausen, Gall  generates a veritable intoxication of sound. As complex and  interconnected the song structures are, they are simultaneously  powerful, exciting and simply created to take in and enjoy. Many  elements flow into this endeavor – and everything fits together  fantastically as well as harmoniously. A real somnambulistic  ‘Dreambox’ as the album is titled. A magic box so thrilling and  inspiring that the jury would like to congratulate Peter Gall and his  quintet for winning the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020.”Peter Gall Quintet received a prize money of 10,000 Euro as well as  the trophy designed by BMW Design. The runner up Adam Bałdych Quartet  was awarded 5,000 Euro.In addition to the award and supported by the jazz award’s partner  Bayerischer Hof, the public’s favorite was also selected. Based on  audience votes at each performance, Adam Bałdych Quartet excited the  guests and will therefore receive an exclusive performance at the  Night Club of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich.Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,  Director of Hu-man Resources and Labour Relations, praised the skills  of the finalists: “I am delighted that we were now able to hold the  final concert of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 this year and celebrate  its winner. My fullest congratulations to the Peter Gall Quintet. I  would also like to thank our long-standing partners, especially the  state capital Munich. Together with them, the BMW Group stands for  reliability and takes its social and cultural responsibilities  seriously for already 50 years now.Therefore, it gives me great  pleasure that the BMW Welt Jazz Award will also be continued next  year. Following the theme ‘Key Position’, the BMW Welt Jazz Award will  focus on one of the characterizing instruments of jazz music: the  piano. It has been playing an important role and has been inspiring  audiences from the very beginning with ragtime and boogie woogie over  great bigband pianists and legends of modern jazz until now.”“I cannot think of our city’s cultural life without the BMW Welt Jazz  Award anymore. The series of concerts at BMW Welt with high-ranking  jazz ensembles gives free access to thousands of music fans for many  years now. I am very grateful to our partner BMW for their great and  continuous cultural engagement over all those years. It fills me with  joy that by providing the philharmonic hall for this year’s final  concert, a large audience could be a part of it following the  necessary COVID regulations,” said Anton Biebl, Head of the Department  of Cultural Affairs of the state capital Munich.Different from the previous years, there were only five instead of  six performances given by renowned ensembles from around the world in  the double coned structure of BMW Welt in January and February 2020.  Besides the two finalists, the musicians playing in the double cone  structure of BMW Welt were: Cecilie Grundt Quintet (Norway), the  Andrea Hermenau Quintet (Germany) and Reis/Demuth/Wiltgen  (Luxembourg). The sixth concert with the Giovanni Guidi Quintet  (Italy) had to be cancelled due to related measures taken to control  the corona virus. The Italian jazz pianist and his quintet will now  perform at BMW Welt Jazz Award 2022 following the theme “Key Position”.The winner of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 was selected by a  top-class jury of reputable jazz experts and connoisseurs. Chaired by  Oliver Hochkeppel (music and culture correspondent with Süddeutsche  Zeitung), the panel members were: Roland Spiegel (music editor and  jazz specialist with the Bavarian broadcaster BR-KLASSIK), Andreas  Kolb (editor-in-chief of JazzZeitung.de and nmz - neue musikzeitung),  Heike Lies (musicologist with the Music and Musical Theatre Division  of the City of Munich’s Department of Culture), and Christiane  Böhnke-Geisse (artistic director of the international jazz festival  Bingen swingt).This year the BMW Welt Jazz Awards benefited from the kind support of  nmz – neue musikzeitung, the Department of Cultural Affairs of the  state capital Munich, the renowned Munich luxury hotel Bayerischer Hof  and the Munich radio station egoFM. For further questions please contact:Daria  NikitinaBMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs HR,  Work Environment, Real Estate, Corporate CitizenshipCultural  Engagement Telephone: +49 89 382 60340Email: Daria.Nikitina@bmw.deProf. Dr Thomas GirstBMW Group Corporate and Governmental  AffairsHR, Work Environment, Real Estate, Corporate  CitizenshipHead of Cultural Engagement Telephone: +49 89  382 24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comwww.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.de;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The BMW Art Cars go digital. Acute Art and BMW are presenting the first ever BMW Art Cars exhibition in augmented reality. ;To celebrate 50 years of cultural commitment, BMW is joining forces with Acute Art to initiate a unique exhibition: For the first time ever the renowned BMW Art Car Collection is shown in augmented reality (AR).

To celebrate 50 years of cultural commitment,  BMW is joining forces with Acute Art to initiate a unique exhibition:  For the first time ever the renowned BMW Art Car Collection is shown  in augmented reality (AR). On July 21, the project is launched via the  free Acute Art app, marking the first time that the digital rolling  sculptures are available for everyone all around the world at any time.Initiated by French race car driver and art aficionado Hervé Poulain  and conceived in collaboration with the founder of BMW Motorsport  Jochen Neerpasch, the first BMW Art Car was commissioned when both  asked Alexander Calder to design Poulain’s BMW race car in 1975. Since  then, 19 prominent artists from throughout the world have designed BMW  automobiles of their times, all making extremely different artistic  statements and reflecting the cultural and historical development of  art, design, and technology. On the occasion of 50 years of BMW Group  Cultural Engagement, the Art Cars are finally entering the digital  realm and can virtually be staged in this wholly immersive 360°  exhibition: indoors, outdoors and in any location the user desires.On July 21, the first BMW Art Cars can be experienced via the App:  Alexander Calder (BMW 3.0 CSL, 1975), Michael Jagamara Nelson (BMW M3,  1989), Ken Done (BMW M3, 1989), Matazo Kayama (BMW 535i, 1990), Esther  Mahlangu (BMW 525i, 1991), Jeff Koons (BMW M3 GT2, 2010) and John  Baldessari (BMW M6 GTLM, 2016). From then on, further BMW Art Cars  will be integrated in the Acute Art App every two weeks. On time for  the Art Basel in Basel all Art Cars will be included in the App.To fully discover and experience the interactive BMW Art Cars, the  Acute Art app is available free of charge on the App  Store and Google Play.1.

Through  mutual respect and curiosity, BMW is connecting people through culture  across the globe – both physically and virtually. This is why BMW is  partnering up with Acute Art: to push the physical boundaries of art  by exploring the medium in a different dimension.“The BMW Art Cars are an essential part of the DNA of BMW’s  50-year-long cultural engagement. Finally, they are entering the  digital realm and can be accessible everywhere and for everyone. I am  excited about the collaboration with Acute Art as we both strive for  innovation and cutting edge technology. I can‘t wait to place the Art  Cars in my living room and get behind the wheel of these exceptional  masterpieces!”, says Pieter Nota, member of the Board of    Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. Acute Art collaborates with the world’s leading  contemporary artists, providing access to cutting-edge technologies  that allow them to translate their creative vision into new digital  mediums – including virtual, augmented and mixed realities. Today’s  immersive media give rise to new possibilities for the production and  distribution of art and the arrival of augmented reality makes  possible entirely new exhibition formats.“We are thrilled about this partnership with BMW, a company that has  demonstrated an exceptional commitment to technological innovation and  art over decades” says Jacob De Geer, CEO of Acute  Art. “Acute Art was founded on the vision of democratising  art and bringing it to places where it could not be before. In these  challenging times we have to find new solutions. The collaboration  with the BMW Group will intensify the exchange between technology,  design and art. Together we will explore future landscapes involving  today’s most innovative minds working in these fields.”Acute Art’s collaboration with the BMW Group will make the Art Cars  digitally visible anywhere in the world for the very first time.  Through the app, they can be individually displayed, or users can also  display multiple vehicles together at the same time. To this end, the  real Art Cars were carefully scanned from all angles using a  photogrammetry methodology, capturing every detail of the artists’  intervention on the car's surface. Finally, the cars were assembled  digitally to create an accurate representation of the Art Cars in AR.During Art Basel in Basel, Switzerland, the BMW Group will celebrate  50 years of cultural commitment with this unique interactive  exhibition at a private event on September 21. The BMW Art Car by  Alexander Calder will be on display and a specially created augmented  reality area will invite guests to experience the digital Art Cars in  the Acute Art App on-site. For further questions please contact:Prof. Dr  Thomas GirstBMW Group Corporate and Governmental  AffairsHead of Cultural EngagementTelephone: +49 89 382  24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comMedia website: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmwgroup.comIrene DueAcute ArtHead of CommunicationsTelephone:  +44 203 751 0563Email: irene@acuteart.com ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WorldSBK: BMW Motorrad Motorsport returns to the ‘Cathedral of Speed’.;BMW Motorrad Motorsport returns to the ‘Cathedral of Speed’. Having taken a year's break due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the FIM Superbike World Championship is returning to the TT Circuit at Assen (NED) this coming weekend (23rd to 25th July). The fifth event of the 2021 season will take place at the historic circuit in north-eastern Netherlands.;Munich. BMW Motorrad Motorsport returns to the ‘Cathedral of    Speed’. Having taken a year's break due to the Coronavirus pandemic,    the FIM Superbike World Championship is returning to the TT Circuit    at Assen (NED) this coming weekend (23rd to 25th July). The fifth    event of the 2021 season will take place at the historic circuit in    north-eastern Netherlands. The first motorbike race in the region    took place as long ago as 1925 and the permanent circuit was opened    in 1955. Racers and fans are equally enthusiastic about the    challenging course, which boasts high speeds and swift changes of direction. At Assen, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team will be aiming to build on  the successful weekend at Donington Park (GBR), where Tom Sykes (GBR)  and Michael van der Mark (NED) recorded the first WorldSBK podiums for  the new BMW M 1000 RR. The BMW satellite team MGM Racing will again be  competing with Jonas Folger (GER) at Assen. For internal reasons, the  RC Squadra Corse team will not be attending the Assen round. Quotes ahead of the Assen round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Assen is a very special circuit and you can really feel the  over 100 years of motorbike tradition in every corner. Of course, the  podiums at Donington Park have given us some extra momentum for Assen,  but we know that we still have a lot of work ahead of us. Now we need  to back up the results from Donington. The TT Circuit has a very  special character. It's a fast track layout with lots of leaning and  some high outside turns – these are the challenges that we face during  setup for our BMW M 1000 RR. We are looking forward to the Assen  weekend and also to the enthusiastic Dutch fans, who are sure to  generate a great atmosphere once again at the TT Circuit. We deeply  regret that RC Squadra Corse is unable to participate at Assen and we  hope to see them back on the track again soon.”   Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “The team came away from round four at Donington Park with a  very positive state of mind. Both Tom and Michael reached the level we  were hoping in a successful event with some podium success. But more  important for us is that the gap to the front is much reduced, which  is our target. We are going to Assen having had a strong performance  there the last time we were there in 2019. We aim to take over our  level of performance from Donington Park over to Assen. For sure,  Michael will have a home turf advantage similar to Tom at Donington,  but in general we believe the BMW M 1000 RR can performance strongly  at Assen. Overall, our expectations are that we can continue the good  work at Donington and continue to close the gap to the leading group.  If we succeed in doing so we would be very happy.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Obviously I  am very much looking forward to Assen. On the back of some strong  results for the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team at Donington I am  going to Assen trying to keep that momentum going. We have certainly  found some improvements with the new BMW M 1000 RR and Assen to me is  a circuit I really enjoy. It’s a very exciting track and my target  would be to get back on the podium. That’s what I am aiming for and  for my team-mate Michael, it’s his home race, so he will be pushing  for something extra. Overall I think we have all ingredients to try to  make it a successful weekend again. It will also be a pleasure to see  fans on the grandstands again after they already cheered us at  Donington so I am looking forward to that as well.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Assen is a special race for me, my home race, and I missed  it last year. It definitely is one of my favourite tracks, also  because I really enjoy the fast and flowing bits. Especially the last  part of the circuit is great;" good stability  """;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Track facts and key factors: BMW i Andretti Motorsport ahead of the London E-Prix.;In our preview, we present the most important facts and key factors of the London E-Prix.;Munich. After Maximilian Günther’s (GER) victory in New York    City (USA), BMW i Andretti Motorsport now heads to the team’s next    home event, the London E-Prix (GBR). The team’s headquarters in    Banbury (GBR) is less than 150 kilometres from the ‘ExCel Circuit’.    The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to London for the    first time since 2016 with races 12 and 13 of the season on Saturday    and Sunday. One of the features of the new circuit is that it is    partly outside and partly in the halls of the ExCel London    exhibition centre. Günther and Jake Dennis (GBR), for whom the    London E-Prix (GBR) is also a home outing, lie 14th and    15th in the Drivers’ Championship – each with 54 points –    ahead of the penultimate race weekend of the season. However, they    trail the championship leader by just 27 points. BMW i Andretti    Motorsport is currently sixth in the Team competition with 108    points. In our preview, we present the most important facts and key    factors of the London E-Prix. You can find detailed information in our media guide: https://b.mw/Formula_E_Media_Guide.  It provides detailed information on the technology behind the BMW i  drivetrain and the BMW iFE.21, background stories on the technology  transfer between motor racing and production development, the BMW i  Andretti Motorsport Team and the drivers as well as the BMW Group  safety car fleet.

It is fantastic to be back in  London after such a long absence. A new and very unique venue for all.  It’s the first time that the track will feature an indoor section as  well as the conventional outdoor surfaces. At this stage, we know  little of the track surface and how this will evolve with cars running  on it. Fortunately, we have a practice session on the Friday afternoon  which will give us overnight to review and consider how we might adapt  to the new circuit. For the first time as well, the FIA has decided to  reduce the amount of available energy to us for the race by just under  ten percent. The nature of the track with the full amount of energy  would likely have led to flat out racing but the reduced amount will  bring back an element of energy saving. Both drivers now have a win a  piece and I am sure both will be vying for more success. There is a  lot to play for in both the team’s and driver’s championships.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21):“I am extremely excited about my home race in London. Nobody knows  the circuit, which suits me as a rookie. I hope we come out of the  blocks quickly in the first practice session and qualify well. It  looks as though it is going to be difficult to overtake, which makes  it all the more important to secure a good grid position.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21):“London is an outstanding place to go racing. It’s a really cool  element to be racing indoor and outdoor. The track looks very  technical and I definitely can’t wait to drive my first proper laps  there. We are heading into the last four races of the season and  everything is possible. So as always, we just focus on a good  performance from our side.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

The main topics of the IAA MOBILITY 2021 will be circular  economy, sustainability and urban mobility.The IAA is looking to strike up dialogue with visitors at various  locations in the Bavarian regional capital – both the traditional  exhibition halls and the Open Space made up of Munich’s most  attractive city squares. Visitors who can’t be there in person can  live-stream the IAA or catch up with events using recorded coverage.With its Open Space stage for new mobility concepts, the IAA will  create an easily accessible format for visitors and take the personal  mobility of the future to where it will take place – in the heart of  the city. On city squares in the centre of Munich, such as  Marienplatz, Odeonsplatz or Max-Joseph-Platz, visitors will be able to  explore the latest vehicles and innovations from well-known carmakers,  and get involved in live discussions and an extensive entertainment  and cultural programme.The BMW Group will be the largest exhibitor at the IAA and will  welcome visitors to the halls at the exhibition grounds, to BMW’s  “four-cylinder building” headquarters, BMW Welt and the BMW Museum,  and to the BMW Hubs exploring the themes of sustainability and  circular economy at Max-Josef-Platz in front of the Bavarian State Opera.“The IAA is exploring the challenges of mobility in the future and  offers an important forum for the ideas and concepts that carmakers  are coming up with,” says Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President Customer  and Brand BMW. “BMW wants to be part of the discussion and is keen to  actively offer solutions. To this end, we are using the IAA to give  insights into our visions of increased sustainability, a coherently  devised circular economy and urban mobility. We are inviting show  attendees to take part in an open discussion – in person at the BMW  Hubs in Munich and digitally around the world.”“Climate protection and personal mobility are not a contradiction in  terms,” emphasises Maximilian Schöberl, General Representative of BMW  AG and Head of Group Communications and Politics at the BMW Group.  “Our company is using new technologies, innovations and our  cutting-edge vehicles to meet the demands of society for greater  sustainability – without taking personal mobility away from people.”Open Space: a forum for information and  discussionThe new Open Space event concept sees the IAA  branching out beyond the show halls for the first time and opening up  to a wider audience. Across a network of hip, modern Labs in Munich,  exhibitors will discuss future mobility with members of the public.  The BMW Group is seeking to hold an open discussion with trade  professionals and the public at two locations in the city.BMW Sustainability LabThe BMW Group has set  itself the twin goals of cutting CO2 emissions from  production by 80 per cent up to 2030 and bringing a total of around  ten million fully electric vehicles onto the roads over the next ten  years or so. In addition, the aim is to reduce CO2  emissions per vehicle over the course of their lifecycle by at least a  third. The BMW Group is also committed to putting in place the most  sustainable supply chain in the whole of the automotive industry.How these aims can be achieved is the focus of the BMW Sustainability  Lab. The spotlight here extends beyond the development of locally  emission-free vehicles; CO2 emissions: 0  g/km. *Estimated figures, not yet officially confirmed.)Like the i4, the iX is also due to come onto the market in November  this year. The IAA gives visitors their first chance to explore the  two electric vehicles in person.The BMW Hub also focuses on the further development of vehicles  powered by a hydrogen fuel-cell drive system. The BMW Group is  piloting the second generation of this drive system type with the BMW  i Hydrogen NEXT. This all-electric vehicle – which is currently  undergoing testing in everyday conditions – uses hydrogen as an energy  source, converting it into power in a fuel cell. At the IAA, the  vehicle (based on the BMW X5) will be on show at the BMW Hub and BMW  Welt, and in action as a shuttle in the Blue Lane connecting the show locations.BMW Motorrad: an established component of the urban mobility  concept.As well as the two new electric BMW models,  visitors to the company’s stand will also find the latest highlights  from BMW Motorrad. These play an established role in the BMW Group’s  approach to developing innovative mobility solutions in the future.BMW Motorrad will have a total of three pioneering models on display  at this year’s IAA. These include the BMW CE 04 electric scooter with  its completely re-thought design. The CE 04 celebrated its world  premiere on 7 July 2021, and the IAA will now give the wider public  the chance to view and come into contact with it.In addition to the emission-free BMW CE 04 scooter, BMW Motorrad is  also unveiling two other exciting concept studies at the IAA. These  fully electric mobility concepts for the future have been developed  specifically for use in urban spaces and to meet the preferences and  requirements of the people who live there.MINI HUBThe main attraction of the MINI HUB at  the IAA is the MINI Urbanaut, an innovative vision of space for future  mobility. First presented at #NEXTGen 2020, the Urbanaut will appear  at the MINI HUB in the Open Space in model form and so give visitors  their first physical experience of the car. The signature MINI  characteristics are transported into the future of mobility in  distinctively re-interpreted form. The MINI Vision Urbanaut epitomises  the “Clever Use of Space” and provides an answer to the needs of  future cities and lifestyles.The electrically powered MINI Vision Urbanaut offers the user a host  of MINI moments: “Chill” gives them a kind of retreat and urban oasis;  “Wanderlust” provides a road-trip companion;" and “Vibe” creates a  meeting place for friends and family.To this end, the interior has been completely reimagined and given an  extremely warm and cosy ambience through the use of sustainable  materials such as cork for the flooring and steering wheel and  recycled textiles for the seats. The reduction in the number of  component parts included and the lack of leather and chrome underscore  the Vision’s focus on sustainability.Visitors to the Open Space can sample the highlights of the MINI  Vision Urbanaut at close quarters. Among them are the rotating  driver’s seat, a dashboard that lowers and can turn into a daybed, and  a steering wheel that extends when the relevant MINI moment is  initiated. Another impressive feature is the opening/closing  functionality of the windscreen, which combines with the daybed to  create a “Street Balcony”.BMW Startup Garage HubVisitors can get up to  speed on the BMW Startup Garage at the BMW Startup Garage Hub. An  exhibition showcases a selection of innovative startups which are now  part of the BMW Startup Garage scheme and already play a major role in  increasing sustainability.A live pitch event – one of the highlights of the programme – will  take place on 9 September. This one-hour show will see innovative  young companies from around the world presenting their standout  technologies in the area of sustainability.The startups were selected and assessed as part of the Open Call 360°  Sustainability Challenge. The finalists are given access to the BMW  Startup Garage’s venture client programme, opening up the opportunity  for a long-term supplier relationship.The BMW Group launched the BMW Startup Garage as a venture client  unit in 2015. Since then, more than 100 young technology companies  have passed through the programme, with investment volumes exceeding  2.8 billion US dollars.The aim of the BMW Startup Garage is to provide early access to new  technologies and innovations focusing on future mobility. Recently  founded companies worldwide can sign up to take part in the programme  at the BMW Startup Garage site www.bmwstartupgarage.com.BMW “four-cylinder” building and BMW WeltOther  go-to locations for IAA visitors this year include the illuminated BMW  “four-cylinder” building and nearby BMW Welt and BMW Museum.The futuristic exhibition, experience, and event space of BMW Welt  will provide the largest showroom at the IAA. Here at the BMW Group’s  experience world, visitors can admire most of the current models from  the BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad brands.A new exhibition on sustainability at the BMW Museum is opening for  the IAA. Covering a 1,000-square-metre area, it will give visitors the  chance to learn more about electric vehicles and how a coherent  circular economy approach can reduce CO2 emissions from  production. The exhibition will stay open beyond the IAA and run for  17 months in total.Blue Lane: low-emission link between the IAA  venuesVisitors can reach the exhibitors’ various event  locations via the Blue Lane. Just under 12 kilometres in length, this  route through the centre of Munich links all the BMW locations, from  the IAA show halls with the various BMW Hubs, to BMW Welt and the Open  Space areas including BMW’s Sustainability Lab and RE: BMW Circular  Lab located at the Bavarian State Opera.In the test area for electric, hybrid and hydrogen-powered vehicles,  visitors can experience for themselves trailblazing innovations  focusing on mobility and emission-free driving. The Blue Lane links  car traffic and local public transport.The BMW Group digital world at the IAAMobility  fans unable to attend the IAA in person can follow the world’s largest  motor show live via IAA Mobility Virtual or stream the recorded  coverage later on. The BMW Group has set up a dedicated digital  channel for this service which will allow it to guide online visitors  around all the BMW locations and themes.People attending BMW’s Summit events digitally will witness the  presentation of the latest vehicles, can find out more about  sustainability and circular economy in the Hubs and Labs, attend  presentations and discussions on the future of mobility and learn more  about innovations.

Third place on the podium for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team in dramatic 12-hour race at Estoril.;Second race and a second podium finish for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team and the new #37 BMW M 1000 RR in the FIM Endurance World Championship 2021 (FIM EWC). In the, at times, dramatic 12-hour race at Estoril (POR), Xavi Forés (ESP), Markus Reiterberger (GER) and Kenny Foray (FRA) secured third place on the podium as at the Le Mans (FRA) season opener.;Estoril. Second race and a second podium finish for the BMW    Motorrad World Endurance Team and the new #37 BMW M 1000 RR in the    FIM Endurance World Championship 2021 (FIM EWC). In the, at times,    dramatic 12-hour race at Estoril (POR), Xavi Forés (ESP), Markus    Reiterberger (GER) and Kenny Foray (FRA) secured third place on the    podium as at the Le Mans (FRA) season opener. Once again they    battled their way back up the field impressively after a fall in the    opening stage forced the team right down the field to start with.    The podium finish was a fitting present for Team Manager Werner    Daemen’s 50th birthday. Everything was going perfectly for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team to begin with. Starting from second on the grid, Forés took the  lead after just a few minutes. The #37 M RR dropped back into second  place briefly after about 50 minutes, but was soon back in front.  Reiterberger then extended the lead but after almost two and a half  hours of racing Foray skidded while in the lead and fell. He returned  the #37 M RR to the pits and after a repair break lasting four and a  half minutes it was back to the race. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team was temporarily in 20th place and trailing by four laps, but from  there the only way was up. The rest of the race was turbulent at times, with various race  leaders dropping right down the field after falls or issues, but went  without a hitch for Forés, Reiterberger and Foray and they made up  place after place with fast lap times. Forés held the fastest lap time  of the whole field for quite some time. After five hours of racing  they had worked their way into the top ten. The trio was in sixth  place after seven hours, and moved up into fourth place soon after,  when two motorbikes in the leading pack collided. That was when the  BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team set about reducing the margin to the  top three. In the final stage the race became something of a real sprint  thriller. Ninety minutes before the end the team leading at that time  developed a problem which put the podium within realistic reach of the  #37 M RR. When all the teams had completed their final pit stops 30  minutes before the chequered flag, Reiterberger, the closing rider,  was just ten seconds off the podium. He really went for it and set the  team’s fastest race lap in the final stint (just six-thousandths of a  second behind the fastest lap overall). Reiterberger closed the gap to  two seconds – and just a few minutes before the end of the race, the  rider in third place ended up in the gravel. That cleared the path to  third place and the second podium finish in a row. After 416 laps,  Reiterberger crossed the finish line in third place with the #37 M RR,  just 0.976 seconds behind second place. The privateer BMW squad Team LRP Poland finished in 16th place. The  riders of the #90 BMW S 1000 RR were Nigel Walraven (NED), Stefan  Kerschbaumer (AUT) and Thomas Gradinger (AUT). Quotes after the ‘12 Hours of Estoril’. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Congratulations to the whole team on another fantastic  performance. It was a real thriller and history repeated itself. It  was similar to Le Mans: leading shortly after the start, then a  setback, then moving up the field to finish on the podium. We weren’t  quite able to race at our pace in the first stint with the cool track  temperatures. Things went really well from the second stint and our  pace was definitely good enough to win. Unfortunately, Kenny fell and  we dropped down to P20. Everyone did a magnificent job in the ensuing  race to catch up. Our pace was really good down to the wire, but  realistically we wouldn’t have done better than P4 or P5. But the  other teams also experienced a few dramas, so the battle for P2 to P4  was really close in the end. We had to change the brakes, which was  planned, but the final two stints from Xavi and Markus were incredibly  strong so we really piled the pressure on the rider in third place. To  end up finishing in P3 less than one second behind second place –  after the fall at the beginning – we have to be pleased with that  result. We saw that we had the pace required to win. Now we are in a  very good starting position for the rest of the season, and our motto  for the Bol d’Or in September is ‘full attack’. After all, we are  still in with a chance of winning the world championship. We still  have some work to do, but have a very good team, a very good bike, and  the potential to become even better. I’d like to thank the team, they  did a fantastic job, were great in the pit stops, and I’m happy that  we could mark Werner Daemen’s 50th birthday by gifting him this podium.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “What a big day. It was a very exciting day, to be honest.  I’m really enjoying my present now. It also was a very difficult day  with the crash and some small issues but in the end we got the podium  and I am really, really happy. I think the team again did a great job  and except for the crash, everything was perfect and we showed again  that we are among the top runners in the World Championship. I am sure  that soon we can reach the highest step of the podium.” Markus Reiterberger: “Xavi did a great opening stint.  I took over being in the lead, was able to extend the gap again and  hand over the bike in the lead, too. Unfortunately, Kenny then fell.  Initially, that was a setback for us all but we kept our focus and  always said that we try to get the best out of it. 12 hours is not as  long as 24 hours but we still can achieve something. Xavi did really  strong lap times and I then was able, especially in my last stint, to  give my everything. The bike worked perfectly for me in cooler  conditions. I really pushed and if the race had lasted one lap more,  even second place would have been possible. But we made it to the  podium and that is the main thing. We are still in the mix in the  World Championship.” Xavi Forés: “It was a very tough race. Honestly,  after the crash we could not expect to finish on the podium. But we  had a really good pace, the bike was working really well, so credit to  all the team that worked amazingly to fix the bike in a way that I  could get 1:39 times in all my stints. I am really happy with the  performance we had all weekend. We have shown that we are really  strong and as soon as we can complete the race with no mistakes or  issues we will be on the top step. Thank you to the entire team and to  Markus and Kenny;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
With traditional sporting spirit in the name of John Cooper: The MINI Anniversary Edition. ;MINI celebrates 60 years of collaboration with the Cooper Family. Joint commitment for maximum driving pleasure on the road and legendary success in racing. Edition vehicles are produced in a limited edition of 740 units worldwide as MINI Cooper, MINI Cooper S and MINI John Cooper Works.;Munich. The name John Cooper, born 98 years ago  today, stands not only for great successes in Formula 1, but also for  the traditional sporting spirit of the MINI brand. 60 years ago, John  Cooper laid the foundations for a legendary racing victory in the  classic Mini. It was the beginning of the collaboration between MINI  and the Cooper Family that continues today.  The shared tradition  stretches from the very first Mini Cooper, launched in September 1961,  to the sporty John Cooper Works models in the current model range.To mark the anniversary, the British premium brand is presenting a  special edition of the MINI 3-door that combines a return to history  with state-of-the-art technology. The MINI Anniversary Edition is a  tribute to John Cooper, who passed away in 2000, and a testament to  how maximum driving pleasure is enjoyed in his name today, in the  premium small car segment.Exclusive design and equipment features make the Anniversary Edition   an attractive proposition for MINI fans around the world who are  passionate about the brand's sporting history, closely associated with  the John Cooper name. The special edition will be available as MINI  Cooper 3-door (fuel consumption combined: 6.1 - 5.5 l/100 km according  to WLTP, 5.5 - 5.3 l/100 km according to NEDC;"  CO2 emissions combined: 161 - 155 g/km according to WLTP, 163 - 158  g/km according to NEDC). Production is limited globally to just 740  units. The number of units available in this edition refers to the  starting number 74, which the classic Mini Cooper wore on its first  successful race track appearance.John Cooper earned his status as a racing pioneer as early as the  1950s and with his mid-engine sports cars, he revolutionised Formula  1. His idea, which is still used today, of placing the engine behind  the driver instead of in front of him, helped Jack Brabham to secure  two world championship titles in 1959 and 1960 in Formula 1 Cooper  racing cars. With his penchant for unorthodox solutions, Cooper was  similar to his friend and fellow designer Alec Issigonis, who in turn  had caused a revolution in the small car segment with the classic  Mini. John Cooper immediately recognised the sporting potential of the  compact four-seater and initiated the construction of a small series  of vehicles with larger brakes and an increased engine output from 34  to 55 hp. The Mini Cooper was born and became an instant success. The  Cooper brand and the name lettering surrounded by a red ring now  became famous. Two years later, the even more powerful Mini Cooper S  followed, which laid the foundation for three overall victories at the  Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965 and 1967.From then on, Cooper tuning kits for the brand's production vehicles  enjoyed growing popularity. And even before the market launch of the  modern MINI in 2001, the John Cooper Works brand was created. With  this brand, John Michael """"Mike"""" Cooper, the son of the  Formula 1 team boss, continued the cooperation with MINI.Since 2008, John Cooper Works models have been at the top of the MINI  range as top athletes - now with up to 225 kW/306 hp and suspension  technology developed with racing know-how. The joint sporting career  of MINI and John Cooper Works has been obvious in recent times by six  overall successes in the Dakar Rally. In the latest generation,  Charlie Cooper contributes, as a racing driver and brand ambassador,  to continue the collaboration between his family and MINI.Nuances of the shared history of MINI and the Cooper Family can be  found both on the exterior and in the interior of the new edition  vehicles. As early racing cars designed by John Cooper were  recognisable by their green paintwork with white accents, the MINI  Anniversary Editions are offered in British Racing Green metallic.  Alternatively, Midnight Black metallic variant is available, and for  MINI John Cooper Works the Rebel Green body colour is also offered.  All paint finishes are combined with a roof, exterior mirror caps,  door handles and surrounds for the headlights and rear lights in  white. Other exterior trim elements are offered in Piano Black high gloss.These exterior features are complemented by white bonnet stripes and  a red accent line, a number 74 on the bonnet and doors of the edition  vehicles, is reminiscent of the start of a sporting career, as the  classic Mini Cooper once wore the starting number 74 when it won its  first class on the racetrack.The MINI Anniversary Edition combines the contents of the John Cooper  Works Trim with model exclusive features that emphasise the sporty  character and the awareness of the historical roots. For example, the  suspension with frequency-selective damping is supplemented by 18-inch  John Cooper Works light-alloy wheels in Circuit Spoke 2-tone design.  The """"COOPER"""" name logo can be found on the door sill trims,  on the side scuttles, on the C-pillars and on the center spoke of the  Nappa sports leather steering wheel.The interior equipment of the edition includes John Cooper Works  sports seats in Dinamica/leather Carbon Black finish, an  anthracite-coloured headliner, stainless steel pedal set and interior  trim in  Piano Black high-gloss. The red ring from the original John  Cooper logo adorns the luggage compartment lid and the interior  surface on the passenger side. On the driver's side, the interior  surface features the signatures of John, Mike and Charlie Cooper. As a  further indication of the exclusive character of the edition, the  inside of the driver's door frame features an emblem with John  Cooper's signature, the handwritten note """"1 of 740"""" and the  words """"60 YEARS OF MINI COOPER - THE UNEXPECTED UNDERDOG"""".The exclusive and sporty look of the edition vehicles can be rounded  off with selected retrofit options from the Original MINI Accessories  range. The MINI Waistline Finisher in Piano Black completes the  attractive contrast between black and white trim elements on the  exterior. Other options include a MINI Sport aerial and tailpipe trims  in carbon finish. Punched and slotted John Cooper Works brake discs  are also available for the MINI John Cooper Works in the Anniversary Edition. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product  Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com Fuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption were    measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC)    2007/715 as amended.

All three riders did a  very good job. Xavi and Markus both rode 1:38 times, which was very  strong, and also Kenny did a very good job. He went out in the end  when there was oil on the track, but still bettered his lap time. I am  especially very happy about the race pace, and that is most important.  We are among the frontrunners, all looks good, the team atmosphere is  good. I expect an interesting fight for the first three places.” Markus Reiterberger: “We can be pleased with the  qualifying sessions. We all rode on the same set of tyres yesterday.  Xavi got a fantastic time, and then Kenny and I were on used tyres,  but still did well. It was cooler this morning and everyone was using  new tyres. All three of us improved on our times. Second place is  incredibly important for the start. Now we will come up with a good  strategy for tomorrow. No doubt it will be a tough, long, hot race.  But we are all feeling good and are happy with the lap times and the  feeling on the bike. Thanks go to the team, and now it’s time to go  full throttle in the race.” Xavi Forés: “It was a positive qualifying for us  because all three of us riders have been more or less on the same  pace, which is quite good for the race. Starting from second position  is actually quite good because we have a good pace for the entire race  distance and the tyre life also has been quite good. We will try to  push hard, to fight for the win, to achieve a strong result for the  team and to collect important points for the championship.” Kenny Foray: “It was a good qualifying, even if I was  not totally satisfied with my second session. It was difficult to  manage the tyre and I didn’t have a clear lap. But overall we are  happy with the race pace and the feeling with the race tyre. So for  me, I am confident for tomorrow. As we always say: The race is  tomorrow, but it is good to secure second place in qualifying.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20 years ago: BMW Group chooses Leipzig as site for new plant; Leipzig is chosen from among 250 applicants  Announcement at a press conference in Munich  Plant Leipzig is the production network’s pioneer in electromobility  Total investment of over €3 billion  More than 3 million vehicles made  Further investments in the future of the plant ;Leipzig. Of the 250-plus applications that came in,  only five made it onto the shortlist – but ultimately it was Leipzig  that won. Twenty years ago, on 18 July 2001, the BMW Group announced  at a press conference in Munich that it would build a new plant in  Leipzig. “Here you can see the location that best meets our needs  overall,” said Prof. Joachim Milberg, Chairman of the BMW AG Board of  Management at the time.Leipzig as a base and the over 200-hectare site near the city’s  exhibition centre won on the basis of the following criteria:1. Ideal conditions and location for a future plant2. Availability of qualified personnel3. Use of existing supplies and logistics structures4. Very good infrastructure for traffic, supplies and waste5. Links to the BMW production network6. Fast implementation process7. Economic efficiency and flexibilityAt the time, the BMW Group expected… 5,500halfat in the new plant  Daily output from 2005 was projected to be 650 units, at an investment  of around €1 billion. When production was finally launched, the plant  employed about 2,500 people. Today, twenty years later, daily output  stands at more than 1,100 units, made by a plant workforce of over  8,000 employees. Investments have so far totalled more than €3 billion  and are still ongoing. Since March 2005 Leipzig has produced more than  three million vehicles in total. Speaking about the positive  development of Leipzig, Works Council Chairman Jens Köhler expressed  his delight: “Ever since the decision was made, the management and  Works Council have cooperated to increase the workforce considerably  and make us an integral part of the region.”The choice of Leipzig received an enthusiastic welcome, and support  in the region was huge. There was also a vast number of job  applicants: the day after the announcement, the dedicated call centre  received more than 4,000 calls, and boxes and boxes of mail came in in  a matter of days. In September 2001, a first cohort of 35 trainees  began work at BMW Group Plant Leipzig. Since then Plant Leipzig has  welcomed 900 apprentices, almost all of whom continue to work there.The BMW Group laid the foundation in Leipzig for one of the most  sustainable, state-of-the-art vehicle plants in the world. Its  particularly well thought-out, flexible structures are an outstanding  feature and include the ‘finger’ layout of the assembly hall – a world  first that enables ideal logistics solutions and offers plenty of  scope for flexibility. Specially developed for Plant Leipzig, the  ‘finger’ layout allows trucks to deliver purchased parts and  pre-assemblies straight to the lineside. In addition, new production  stages can be integrated into the process and lines can be extended  without requiring new buildings.Since 2005 Plant Leipzig has consistently demonstrated its  adaptability, integrating new products, processes and technologies and  often playing a pioneering role within the BMW Group production  network. As the birthplace of electromobility at the BMW Group, for  example, Leipzig has manufactured over 200,000 fully electric BMW i3  cars and was the first car plant in the world to use CFRP (carbon  fibre-reinforced plastic) in series production. The BMW Group  continues to benefit from the plant’s collective skills in the field  of electromobility, and Leipzig has been part of the international  production network for high-voltage batteries since May of this year.In 2023 Leipzig will demonstrate its flexibility once again, when it  becomes the first German facility to produce both BMW and MINI  vehicles, all on the same production line. Contracted to manufacture  the all-new successor to the current MINI Countryman, the plant will  make both the combustion-powered and the fully electric versions.  “Over the last few years, we have worked constantly to lead our plant  into a successful future. The contract to manufacture the MINI  Countryman successor is taking us towards a further milestone,” said  Hans-Peter Kemser, Plant Director at BMW Group Plant Leipzig. And  that’s not the only goal Leipzig has set itself: “As a green plant, we  want not only to be carbon-neutral but also to manufacture with zero  CO2 emissions,” said Hans-Peter Kemser, announcing plans for the near  future of the plant.Burkhard Jung, Lord Mayor of Leipzig, also sees the BMW Group’s  choice of Leipzig as a major milestone for the city and region:  “Leipzig is an industrial base again. This development – which has  been so important for us in economic terms – would have been almost  unimaginable without the decision that was made in Munich 20 years  ago. Over the last two decades, the north of Leipzig has evolved to  become an industry heartland for the entire region. It’s a  technological and industrial development that is benefitting people  from Leipzig and far beyond. BMW in Leipzig not only produces cars but  also works on the vehicles and production methods of the future. That  fills me with confidence: Leipzig will remain particularly important,  both for the transformation of transport and in the development of new technologies.”Key events, past and future, at BMW Group Plant Leipzig:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Berlin Brawl: Esports stars go back in time to the 1980s at LVL World of Gaming – FNATIC defends its title.;The second edition of the Berlin Brawl took the United in Rivalry teams supported by BMW and their fans back in time. On Monday, players from G2 Esports, FNATIC, OG Esports and FunPlus Phoenix met at LVL World of Gaming in Berlin (GER) and duelled each other in three cult classics from the 1980s. In keeping with the ethos of the Berlin Brawl, BMW showcased a real cult car, the Ken Done BMW M3 Art Car from 1989.;Munich. The second edition of the Berlin Brawl took the United    in Rivalry teams supported by BMW and their fans back in time. On    Monday, players from G2 Esports, FNATIC, OG Esports and FunPlus    Phoenix met at LVL World of Gaming in Berlin (GER) and entered    unfamiliar territory. Instead of showing off their skills in League    of Legends, Dota 2 or Valorant, they entered the world of arcade    games and duelled each other in three cult classics from the 1980s:    Vulgus, Strider and Street Fighter II Turbo. Victory went to FNATIC,    as it did last year. In keeping with the ethos of the Berlin Brawl,    hosted by Eefje Depoortere, as Official Automotive Partner at LVL    World of Gaming, BMW showcased a real cult car, the Ken Done BMW M3    Art Car from 1989. “This Berlin Brawl with a retro look reminded us once again that the  obsession with Esports and gaming is not a new phenomenon, it has  decades of tradition,” said Ingmar Johannsen, Head of BMW Esports.  “Congratulations to Bwipo and FNATIC, who had also edged it against G2  Esports at the Brawl premiere in 2020. Once again LVL World of Gaming  was a fantastic stage for our United in Rivalry derby. It’s fantastic  that this event got our collaboration as Official Automotive Partner  off to a spectacular start. At times there were more than 12,000  viewers following the Berlin Brawl at the same time on Twitch. The  response from the community was very positive. Thank you to all teams  who got involved in this journey to the 1980s.” BMW Esports teams were represented by the players Caps, Mikyx (both  G2 Esports), Bean, Bwipo (both FNATIC), N0tail (OG Esports) and ANGE1  (FunPlus Phoenix) in Berlin. The challenge was to modify their skills  perfected for modern games to suit three cult classics. Bwipo was the  most successful, beating Caps in the final. To celebrate both the arcade game era in the 1980s and the new  partnership between BMW and LVL World of Gaming, the BMW M3 Art Car of  artist Ken Done from 1989 was on display in Berlin. There is a long  tradition of BMW Art Cars. From the 1970s to today, world-famous  artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Jeff Koons have  immortalized themselves with their designs on BMW racing and road  cars. The BMW M3 made its debut in 1987, the same year that the Vulgus  game was released, and the first Street Fighter. Street Fighter II  Turbo followed in 1992, the same year in which the second-generation  BMW M3 was launched. As part of the Berlin Brawl, BMW also gave fans the opportunity to  get further acquainted with The Rival Rig, which had made its debut at  the BMW Esports Boost at the end of June. This visionary Esports  hardware is the first product from the virtual RIVALWORKS technology  factory. The Berlin Brawl was also the first event made available for  the community to follow on the new BMW Esports Discord server. BMW  will now also present itself to fans on this communication platform  used by gamers around the world at www.discord.gg/bmwesports. About BMW Esports.BMW has been collaborating with five of the world’s best teams as a  partner in the classic League of Legends game since 2020. Cloud 9,  FNATIC, FunPlus Phoenix, G2 Esports and T1 fly the BMW colours in the  biggest events in the industry. The highlight of the first  collaborative season in 2020 was the Worlds, in which G2 esports and  FNATIC made it to the knock-out stage of the finals in the battle of  the world’s best teams. G2 Esports even made it to the semi-final. The  Dota 2 specialists OG Esport are a new addition to the ‘United in  Rivalry’ squad as of 2021. The involvement in Esports gives BMW  completely new touch points with a dynamic, rapidly growing community;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bidirectional Charging Management (BCM) pilot project enters key phase: customer test vehicles with the ability to give back green energy.; As announced: 50 BMW i3 handed over to customers with new technology  Vehicle handover at BMW Welt in Munich  Strong interest from customers ; ### Start of the joint press release from all partners mentioned  herein ###Munich. The first vehicles for the customer pilot  phase were handed over to their users at BMW Welt on 9 July. This  means that customers are now in possession of 20 BMW i3 cars equipped  with the new technology, with a further 30 due to be delivered to  business users in the coming weeks.The “Bidirectional Charging Management – BCM” consortium research  project launched in May 2019 brings together companies and  institutions from the automotive, charging infrastructure, energy and  scientific sectors. They have teamed up to develop technological  solutions for making electric mobility even easier and cheaper for  users, with even lower emissions. By adopting a holistic approach, the project aims to interlink  vehicles, charging infrastructure and power grids for the first time  in a way that facilitates the use of renewable energy – and at the  same time increases power supply reliability. The research project  will run for three years under the aegis of the German Aero-space  Centre and with funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic  Affairs and Energy. Start of testing under everyday conditions.Not only will electric vehicles with bidirectional charging  capability be able to draw electrical power for their high-voltage  battery when plugged into a compatible charging station or wallbox,  they will also have the ability to reverse the process and feed energy  back into the distribution network operator’s power grid. This will  effectively turn the electric vehicles’ batteries into mobile energy  storage devices that can also supply electricity when required.  Integrating as many electric vehicles as possible into the power grid  in this way calls for myriad innovations in terms of vehicle  technology, charging hardware, charging management, communication  interfaces with energy sector stakeholders and legal parameters.  Bringing about these advances is the task of the research  project, in which the BMW Group is acting as consortium leader. It is  joined by KOSTAL Industrie Elektrik GmbH (development of charging  hardware), KEO GmbH (software provider for connecting the customers  systems with energy suppliers), transmission network operator TenneT  and distribution network operator Bayernwerk Netz GmbH (both energy  system services), the Research Institute for Energy and Research  Association for Energy e.V. (both FfE research into energy system and  grid repercussions as well as measurement data evaluation), the  Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

After third place on the podium at the season opener, the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) in June, Werner Daemen’s team is confident ahead of the second endurance race with the new #37 BMW M 1000 RR.;Estoril. The stage is set for the second round of the FIM Endurance    World Championship 2021 (FIM EWC): This Saturday (17th July) BMW    Motorrad World Endurance Team will take on the 12-hour race at    Estoril, Portugal. After third place on the podium at the season    opener, the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) in June, Werner Daemen’s team    is confident ahead of the second endurance race with the new #37 BMW    M 1000 RR. The #37 M RR will be ridden by Markus Reiterberger (GER), Xavi Forés  (ESP) and Kenny Foray (FRA), the fourth rider of the BMW Motorrad  World Endurance Team, at Estoril. Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) will be in  action in the International German Motorcycle Championship (IDM) at  the Nürburgring (GER) at the same time. Forés was recently forced to  sit out races after injuring his wrist in the British Superbike  Championship (BSB) but was able to take part in the Estoril test rides  without any restrictions on Tuesday, and was given the go-ahead to  race at the weekend by the official FIM race doctors on late Tuesday  afternoon. Eugene Laverty (IRL) was on hand just in case Forés was  unable to ride, which is why he also completed test laps on the #37  BMW M 1000 RR on Tuesday. Last year the 12-hour race in Estoril was held as the season finale  in September. From third on the grid, BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team took an early lead and broke away from the pack. After a fall and  ensuing repair break, the team battled its way back up the field from  19th place to finish the race in seventh place. In addition to BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, privateers BMW Team  LRP Poland will also be in action at Estoril with the #90 BMW S 1000 RR. Quotes ahead of the ‘12 Hours Estoril’. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Our  goal at Estoril is to carry on where we left off with the strong  performance at Le Mans. We proved the potential of our new BMW M 1000  RR in endurance racing. We were initially pushed back down the field  due to a technical issue, but the team resolved it quickly. The test  on Tuesday was promising once again, so we are optimistic going into  the race weekend. All three of our riders, Markus, Xavi and Kenny,  were riding at the same very high level once again so we are  well-prepared and hope to be as strong as we were at Le Mans. Thanks  also go to Eugene for coming to Estoril at short notice to jump in as  reserve rider if necessary.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “If you see the result from Le Mans where we finished third  despite some setbacks, I expect that we will aim for the podium again  as a minimum. If we stay on two wheels and if we don’t have any  technical problems, which I’m not expecting, I think we will be among  the frontrunners, going for the podium or maybe more.” Markus Reiterberger: “We’re very confident and highly  motivated going into the second race of the FIM EWC season at Estoril.  We have good memories of last year’s event, and it’s a fantastic track  that should suit our motorbike and the tyres should perform well again  there. I expect that it will be really hot, which will be a big  challenge for everyone but we are well-prepared. The team has been  working on the motorbike intensively since Le Mans, and I hope that we  will be able to take the next step and do battle for the win with our  package. We’re hoping for a great, accident-free, successful weekend.  I’m really looking forward to Estoril.” Xavi Forés: “I am really focused on the Estoril race.  It is going to be a very important race for us because we had a good  finish at Le Mans, so the feeling we have from the bike and the tyres  is quite good. I hope that Estoril will suit us all. Last year, the  team did a great job there and I was also fast in World Superbikes  there so hopefully we can do a very good job. The target definitely  has to be to go out and try to fight for the win.” Kenny Foray: “I am really looking forward to being  part of the #37 BMW M 1000 RR line-up in the second round of the FIM  EWC season. It is great to be back on the bike and to ride with Reiti  and Xavi. I think it is possible to secure a strong result. I will  give it my all to help the team to be successful, I will definitely  enjoy this week and I am sure that we will be strong.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW M Motorsport News, 13th July 2021;BMW M Motorsport teams are once again in action all over the world in 2021. They are challenging for race wins and titles with the BMW M6 GT3, the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW M2 CS Racing, and other BMW M Motorsport race cars. Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you an overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. ;Nürburgring Endurance Series: BMW Junior Team and Walkenhorst    Motorsport win at the Nordschleife double header. In a packed racing programme at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER)  races five and six of the Nürburgring Endurance Series 2021 (NLS) were  held as a double header on Saturday and Sunday and the overall win  went to the BMW M6 GT3 on both days. In the fourth NLS race two weeks ago, BMW Juniors Dan Harper (GBR),  Neil Verhagen (USA) and Max Hesse (GER) celebrated their first overall  win in the series, making them the youngest team to date to win an NLS  race. They followed on from this seamlessly on Saturday in NLS5, and  took their second win in a row in the #44 BMW M6 GT3. Starting from  fifth on the grid, Hesse quickly worked his way up through the field  and took the lead during his stint, which his colleagues Verhagen and  Harper brought home successfully. “It’s further evidence of just how quickly our BMW Juniors learn,”  said mentor Jochen Neerpasch. “It wasn’t an easy race, and the race  definitely wasn’t gifted to them, and they handled every situation  well. Hats off to them, they made it to the front.” Hesse said: “I got  off to a good start and it wasn’t long before we were in P2. From then  on we had great pace with fantastic duels, and we were already leading  by twelve seconds when we pitted for the first time. We’re still  learning, but it’s always great to win.” Harper added: “The first win  in NLS4 was really special, but the second win feels just as good. All  three of us had a smooth race with fantastic stints. Huge thanks to  BMW M Motorsport and BMW Team RMG, and everyone supporting us. All the  hard work is starting to pay off with results now.” “It feels amazing  to be on the top step of the podium once again,” said Verhagen. “It  was a fantastic team performance, and we couldn’t have done it without  this hard teamwork.” However, unfortunately the trio was unable to  take part in the sixth race of the season on Sunday after an accident  in the morning’s qualifying session. Harper, driving, was unharmed,  but it wasn’t possible to repair the car in time for the start of the race. It was another BMW M6 GT3 that dominated proceedings on Sunday with  car #34 of Walkenhorst Motorsport with Christian Krognes (NOR), David  Pittard and Ben Tuck (both GBR) at the wheel. In the morning’s  qualifying session, Krognes set a new qualifying record with a time of  7:51.807 minutes. Starting from pole position, he and his two  team-mates went on to bring home Walkenhorst Motorsport’s first NLS  win of the season in the afternoon’s four-hour race. In addition to the two overall wins, Saturday and Sunday saw a total  of ten class wins for the BMW M Motorsport teams. Four of them were  secured by Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive. In the strong  field of the VT2 class, the team won both races with the #481 BMW  330i, driven by Christopher Rink, Philipp Stahlschmidt and Daniel Zils  (all GER). In the V4 class, it was the team’s #1 BMW 325i that was  victorious on both days. Rink shared the car with Danny Brink and  Philipp Leisen (both GER).

In conditions that were treacherous at times, IMSA record winners Bill  Auberlen and Dillon Machavern (both USA) were unbeatable in the #95  BMW M4 GT4. This was already the case in qualifying, when Machavern  put car #95 in pole position. In the actual race, starting driver Machavern kept the Turner  Motorsport BMW M4 GT4 at the front and was in the lead when he handed  the car over to his team-mate Auberlen. The 52-year-old seasoned  driver wowed viewers once again with a magnificent performance. First,  he rapidly broke away from the pack, but wasn’t put off his stride  when yellow flags brought the field back together and it then started  to rain during the final laps. With all his skills he fought off  attacks from behind and got the maximum out of the slicks on the wet track. After two hours, Auberlen crossed the finish line as the winner with  the #95 BMW M4 GT4. After three podium finishes, it was the first win  of the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge season for Auberlen/Machavern.  This success saw the duo take the lead in the GS drivers’ standings.  Their team-mates Vincent Barletta and Robby Foley (both USA) finished  the race in a strong fifth place in the #96 BMW M4 GT4, which saw them  move up into third place in the drivers’ standings. However, Turner Motorsport was unlucky in the following IMSA  WeatherTech SportsCar Championship race at Watkins Glen. They had a  technical issue at the start, and the ensuing repair pushed the #96  BMW M6 GT3, with Auberlen and Foley, right down the field. After two  hours and 40 minutes they crossed the finish line in twelfth place in  the GTD class. Auberlen and Foley still lead the GTD drivers’  standings of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. --ADAC GT Masters: Podium for Schubert Motorsport at Zandvoort. The ADAC GT Masters headed to Zandvoort in the Netherlands at the  weekend, where the Schubert Motorsport team clinched another podium  finish.

On Sunday, the duo finished the second race in P2 with the  #2 BMW M4 GT4 of Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport. The two drivers  finished in seventh place in race one on Saturday. After three events  of the season so far, Piana/Schrey still have a clear lead in the  drivers’ standings. --British GT Championship: Century Motorsport celebrates one-two    result at Donington. It was the perfect racing Sunday for the Century Motorsport team in  the British GT Championship. At Donington Park (GBR), the team  celebrated a one-two result in the GT4 class with their two BMW M4  GT4s. The iconic track in the heart of England hosted the third round  of the 2021 season last weekend. Gus Burton and Will Burns (both GBR) started the two-hour race from  ninth on the grid in the #57 BMW M4 GT4. The duo were unperturbed by  the turbulent race with several safety car periods, and secured the  win with a clear lead. Their team-mates Andrew Gordon-Colebrook and  Chris Salkled (both GBR) rounded off the fantastic result for Century  Motorsport in the #9 BMW M4 GT4. They finished in second place in the  GT4 class, which also saw them clinch the win in the Pro-Am classification. --BMW M2 CS Racing Cup NLS: FK Performance Motorsport with two    wins at the Nordschleife. As part of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS), races five and six  of the season in the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup NLS were held at the  Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) this weekend and one team was  unbeatable.

(AWS), the Challenge encourages entrants to  come up with innovative quantum algorithms and test their solutions on  real quantum computing technologies. Quantum computing holds potential  to address challenging problems in the automotive sector in complex  optimisation, materials research, and – in the form of quantum machine  learning – automated driving in tomorrow’s world. Peter Lehnert, Vice President BMW Group Research, New  Technologies: “The technological landscape in the field of  quantum computing is only just starting to take shape. Different firms  and research institutes are pursuing a variety of approaches. By  launching our crowd innovation initiative, we are hoping to tap into  additional innovative power that would be beyond the reach of a  standard tendering process.” Specific challenges for quantum computing.Experts from the BMW Group have identified over 50 challenges at  various stages of the value chain where quantum computing could  provide a potential benefit in the future. This requires innovative  algorithms and a significant improvement of the hardware. The BMW  Group has decided to engage the global quantum computing community to  help find the best solutions for the immediate future and beyond. The  Quantum Computing Challenge will focus on four specific challenges  where quantum computing could deliver an advantage over classical  computing methods: Registration begins today, and the deadline for submissions is 24  September 2021, after which they will be examined and judged by a  panel of experts. A final event will take place in December 2021,  where the top entrants will have the opportunity to pitch their  solutions to the panel of expert judges. The winners will gain the BMW  Group as a client and will also be involved in the implementation of  the respective pilot projects. AWS is supporting the BMW Group via the Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab,  an expert group of professionals that helped outline the challenge use  cases and who will be on the panel that selects the winners. AWS will  provide credits for entrants to use Amazon Braket to encourage  development and testing of the quantum algorithms submitted. Amazon  Braket provides a development environment for users to explore and  build quantum algorithms, test them on quantum circuit simulators, and  run them on a variety of quantum hardware technologies. “Quantum computing is in its early stages but its long-term impact  promises to be transformational for many industries,” said Bill Vass,  Vice President of Engineering, AWS. “Indeed, enabling cutting edge  research in quantum computing and helping businesses prepare for the  quantum future is why we launched Amazon Braket and built out our team  of experts at the Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab. We’re thrilled to  support BMW and the quantum community in this innovation challenge. We  applaud BMW’s leadership in tackling real industrial challenges where  quantum computers may one day provide an advantage.” BMW Group is driving the creation of a quantum ecosystem.The Quantum Computing Challenge once again underscores how the BMW  Group is playing a leading role in efforts to establish a quantum  ecosystem. As recently as June, the company joined forces with nine  other major corporations to found the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium  (QUTAC). The consortium’s goal is to produce a high quantity of  use cases for industry and, in so doing, create demand for quantum  computing. QUTAC will speed up development of the technology in  Germany and Europe. On 16 June, the BMW Group, together with the Technical University of  Munich (TUM), also announced the creation of an endowed chair in “Quantum Algorithms    and Applications.” Over a period of six years, the BMW Group  will make a fund of €5.1 million available to TUM for a professorship,  equipment and personnel. By taking this step, the BMW Group and TUM  are seeking to bridge the gap between the outstanding basic research  carried out in Germany and its specific application in industry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Saturday’s winner Maximilian Günther fights back strongly after bad luck in qualifying.;One day after his first win of the season in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, Maximilian Günther (GER) made an impressive recovery in the Sunday race at the New York City E-Prix (USA). ;New York. One day after his first win of the season in the ABB    FIA Formula E World Championship, Maximilian Günther (GER) made an    impressive recovery in the Sunday race at the New York City E-Prix    (USA). Rain in qualifying meant he had to start from 23rd    on the grid. However, clever strategy and good energy management    allowed him to gradually work his way through the field until he    eventually climbed into tenth place on the final lap. He was    rewarded for his fighting spirit with one point in the Drivers’    Championship. Like Günther, Jake Dennis (GBR) also suffered from the    fact that it started to rain lightly during qualifying group two,    preventing him from setting a fast time. As a result, he also had to    start from near the back of the grid and ultimately crossed the    finish line in 16th place. Starting his recovery from the back of the field, Günther initially  saved energy to use it later on in the race. That worked out well for  him, and he climbed into the top ten on the final lap, as a number of  drivers were powerless to stop him passing them, thanks to the fact  that he had more energy at his disposal. Dennis started the race from  19th and quickly improved to 13th. However, he  fell back down the field because he missed the activation zone for the  attack mode, costing him a lot of time. He eventually had to settle  for 16th place. Günther and Dennis are now 14th  and 15th in the Drivers’ Championship, each with 54 points.  BMW i Andretti Motorsport lies sixth in the Team competition with 108 points. Races 12 and 13 of the season take place in London (GBR) on  24th and 25th July. Reactions to Race 11 in New York. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“After yesterday’s success this was a disappointing day for us. It  all resulted from the misfortune we had in qualifying with the rain.  Anyway, we tried to make the best of it. With Jake we had a slightly  more aggressive strategy than we had with Maximilian’s car. That was  paying off when he had a good start and passed a couple of drivers  ahead of him. Unfortunately, after he had missed the loops of the  attack zone we were on the backfoot. With Maximilian it was more of a  game of patience. We slowly made our way through the field saving a  lot of energy. Then we took our chances where we could and ended up  finishing in P10. A great recovery drive from Maximilian – and who  knows? This one point can make a huge difference at the end of the season.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    19th place, race result: 16th place, points:    54, driver standings: 15th place):“A difficult race after an unfortunate qualifying with the rain  coming down just as we went on track. In the race I was looking strong  and made up a few places at the start. But then I missed the attack  zone, which basically compromised our whole race. Nothing more I could  do. After that, the race was more or less finished. Now I focus on my  home races in London.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    23rd place, race result: 10th place, points:    54, driver standings: 14th place):“It was fun to race my way into the points from the back of the  field. Given the circumstances, I think we had an ideal race with a  very good strategy. We saved a lot of energy at the start and then  gradually worked our way towards the front. It is obviously very  pleasing to have come away with a point. Thank you to the team for a  great weekend.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

First win of the season: Maximilian Günther triumphs in Saturday’s race in New York.;The spell has been broken: Maximilian Günther (GER) claimed his first win of the season in race ten of this year’s ABB FIA Formula E World Championship in New York City (USA). ;New York. The spell has been broken: Maximilian Günther (GER)    claimed his first win of the season in race ten of this year’s ABB    FIA Formula E World Championship in New York City (USA). Starting    from fourth place on the grid, he managed his energy extremely well    and was then able to climb from third place into the lead in the    closing laps. This was the third win of Günther’s Formula E career    and his first podium this season. Following Jake Dennis’ (GBR)    triumph at Valencia (ESP), this was win number two of Season 7 for    BMW i Andretti Motorsport. Dennis also had a strong race on his    debut in New York, but unfortunately dropped well down the field    after suffering a puncture, before ultimately retiring. Under the watchful eye of Andretti team owner Michael Andretti (USA),  who was attending a Formula E event for the first time this season at  the home round for his team, Günther drove a very clever and strategic  race. He took the attack modes at exactly the right time and had more  energy at his disposal in the closing stages than his closest rivals.  When Jean-Éric Vergne (FRA, DS Techeetah) attacked the leader Nick  Cassidy (NZL, Envision Virgin Racing) in front of Günther, resulting  in both of them straying from the ideal racing line, the Andretti  driver seized the opportunity to pass both cars on the inside and take  the lead. He then did a great job of guiding the car home to take an  impressive victory. In the Driver’s Championship, Günther has climbed  from 18th to 12th place, courtesy of the 25  points for the win. With 53 points, he now trails Dennis in eleventh  place by just one point. BMW i Andretti Motorsport is now sixth in the  Team standings with 107 points. Dennis started the race from 15th place and battled his  way into the points with some impressive racing. Unfortunately, he  suffered a puncture during a courageous overtaking manoeuvre and had  to come into the pits. That initially dropped him well back through  the field, before he eventually had to retire completely. The eleventh race of the season takes place on Sunday at the same venue. Reactions to Race 10 in New York. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“We couldn’t ask for any more today – a great result for the team.  Super happy for a win here in New York at the home race for BMW i  Andretti Motorsport. Seeing team owner Michael Andretti receive the  trophy on the podium and listen to the US anthem was just great.  Maximilian drove a very strong race from P4 on the grid after yet  another Super Pole appearance. Then he managed a great pass against  Jean-Éric Vergne and Nick Cassidy. I’m very pleased for him. He was on  it today from the first practice session. Jake had an unfortunate day,  first with the red flag that ruined his qualifying. He then drove a  smart race with great overtaking and good use of attack mode and made  it into the points, only to have his race ruined by a cut tyre  following contact.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    15th place, race result: DNF, points: 54, driver    standings: 11th place):“A pretty disappointing day, to be honest. In qualifying we were a  bit out of position with the red flag, but I felt like we could move  forward in the race. Everything was going well, we managed to go up to  ninth and maybe were looking for a top-8 or top-7. But then  unfortunately a car from behind made contact and gave me a puncture.  That’s a shame, but it’s encouraging for tomorrow that we have  definitely one of the fastest cars out there. As a team, we can be  happy with the win today. Well done to Maximilian.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    4th place, race result: 1st place, points: 53,    driver standings: 12th place):“Winning here in New York at the team’s home race is very special,  but it’s also a special victory because of the season we had so far.  Many times things didn’t go our way and we couldn’t score as many  points as we wanted to, but we always kept going and focused on  ourselves. We know what we are capable of. Today we did a good job  managing the race. I had the most energy of all frontrunners left in  the end. That is an advantage, but overtaking still is very difficult  here. Jean-Éric made the move into the hairpin, both race leaders ran  wide and for me that was the perfect opportunity to overtake both.  After that I was in a comfortable situation with the amount of energy  I had left.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

Antitrust investigation against automotive manufacturers: European Commission drops most charges against BMW Group;No suspicion of unlawful defeat devices against BMW Group  European Commission enters uncharted territory for antitrust law  Settlement agreed after most allegations dropped  Applying for leniency was not an option for the BMW Group  Talks had no influence on company's product decisions and therefore did not disadvantage customers at all  BMW Group took own approach to exhaust gas treatment from the start +;Munich. After reviewing an extensive statement  submitted by the BMW Group, the European Commission has dropped most  of its charges of antitrust violations. With the withdrawal of most of  the original allegations, the Board of Management of BMW AG has agreed  to a settlement proposed by the European Commission that will bring  these proceedings to an end. No suspicion of unlawful defeat devices against the BMW GroupThe following aspect is particularly important to the BMW Group: The  European Commission has once again confirmed that the investigation  concluded with this settlement solely concerned possible infringements  of competition law. The fine notice issued by the European Commission  also states that there is no indication of collusion between the  parties relating to the use of prohibited defeat devices to manipulate  exhaust gas tests. This underlines that there has never been any  allegation of unlawful manipulation of emission control systems by the  BMW Group. Unlike some of its competitors, the BMW Group never considered  reduced, illegal emission control. Discussions had no influence on product decisionsThe fine now issued by the European Commission pertains to  discussions between automotive manufacturers that took place around  ten years ago. From the BMW Group perspective, the talks were aimed at  creating a customer-friendly AdBlue filling infrastructure to support  an effective exhaust gas treatment system. These discussions had no  influence whatsoever on the company’s product decisions. In a Statement of Objections issued in April 2019 in connection with  this antitrust investigation, the European Commission made very  serious allegations against the BMW Group and others. These  allegations mainly centred on two key issues: First, the accusation of  alleged joint development of a software to restrict AdBlue dosing.  Second, the allegation of delaying and/or preventing development and  rollout of a particle filter for direct-injection petrol engines. In  response to the very serious allegations made at that time, the  company implemented appropriate risk provisioning in April 2019,  recognising a provision of around 1.4 billion euros. Based on a review  of the BMW Group statement, the European Commission dropped the above  allegations relating to AdBlue dosing and the particle filter for  petrol engines. As a consequence, the BMW Group already re-evaluated  its provision on 20 May of this year. This resulted in a positive  effect on earnings of around one billion euros. European Commission enters uncharted territory for antitrust lawThe European Commission acknowledges that the proceedings now  concluded by settlement represent uncharted territory for antitrust  law. Price and territorial agreements were not the subject of this  investigation. The European Commission nevertheless used the standards  generally applied to “classic” cartels of this kind to calculate the  fine – with merely a certain reduction to reflect the unique nature of  the case.Despite the Commission dropping most of its charges, this approach  resulted in a fine of 372.8 million euros. The Board of Management of BMW AG has now accepted this fine in the  current settlement, which acknowledges the excessive transparency  provided in the context of the discussions in question – with regard  to the necessary size of AdBlue tanks, the range that can be achieved  with them and the presumed average AdBlue consumption. From the BMW Group perspective, these discussions were aimed at  creating a customer-friendly AdBlue filling infrastructure, to be  built by the petroleum industry. A marketable filling solution was  crucial to enabling wide-scale use of the highly efficient SCR system for exhaust gas treatment. The discussions were clearly  not held in secret. On the contrary, the aims pursued were openly  communicated to the petroleum industry and within the VDA and ACEA  associations. This was also confirmed by the European Commission. However, excessive transparency, like that during the discussions  between the manufacturers, may also be prohibited under competition  law – even though this transparency did not disadvantage customers in  any way. BMW Group took own approach to exhaust gas treatmentIt became clear during the discussions with the petroleum industry  that the AdBlue filling infrastructure, which was considered necessary  under the conditions at the time, would not be available within the  near future. To avoid any disadvantages this might create for  customers, the BMW Group consistently designed the tank sizes and  ranges of its vehicles to be well above the dimensions agreed in the  working groups. For this purpose, the BMW Group even installed complex  two-tank systems in most vehicles. The European Commission explicitly  recognised this in its decision. The exhaust gas treatment technology used by the BMW Group was  significantly different to its competitors’ solutions from the very  beginning. The BMW Group adopted its own approach, using a combination  of several systems in its diesel vehicles. This included supplementing the SCR emission control systems with an  NOx storage catalytic converter. The result was excellent emissions  performance in real driving conditions and lower AdBlue consumption  than competitor models. In fact, in rolling out its emission control technologies, the BMW  Group was once again fulfilling its aspiration to be an innovation  leader and occupy a leading position among its competitors worldwide  in this area. Applying for leniency not an option for the BMW GroupThe BMW Group made it clear from the start of the antitrust  proceedings that it considered the allegations made at that time to be  exaggerated and unjustified. For this reason, unlike the other  competitors involved, the company did not prematurely admit its guilt  by applying for leniency. Instead, after careful internal preparation  and examination of the substance of the case, a comprehensive  statement was submitted to the European Commission. As a result, the  Commission dropped most of its original allegations against the BMW Group. Comprehensive Compliance Management System ensures responsible    and lawful conductThe BMW Group considers responsible and lawful conduct to be key  elements of its company values and guiding principles worldwide. To  ensure this, the BMW Group relies on a comprehensive Compliance  Management System that is also constantly further developed to reflect  tighter regulatory requirements.    If you have any questions, please contact: Corporate Communications Michael Rebstock, Communications Corporate, Finance, Sales  Email:  michael.rebstock@bmwgroup.com, Telephone: +49 89 382-20470 Eckhard Wannieck, head of Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesEmail: eckhard.wannieck@bmw.de,  Telephone: +49 89 382-24544  Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail: presse@bmwgroup.com  The BMW Group With its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

The new BMW CE 04.;The new BMW CE 04 – the silent revolution: A new chapter in electrically powered urban two-wheel mobility.;Urban freedom“It's early in the morning. The city is awakening. On  the way to my garage I breathe in the still cool air. I wear a  casually cut parka that’s both fashionable and functional at the same  time. The protectors are inconspicuous but give me a sense of  security. I’m ready for the day to start.My BMW CE 04 is in the garage. I am thrilled by its futuristic  design style. The low position of the battery gives the scooter an  entirely new geometry – a complete departure from previous  conventions. I’m glad to see it again. It’s a great feeling – every day.For me, it’s the symbol of a new era – the era of the silent revolution.The first birds are chirping, the urban jungle is  awakening. The sounds of the city begin to swell. Everything is set in  motion. People move – with each other and in parallel. Paths cross.What will the new day bring? Tapas with friends at the little  bar by the river? Or the exhibition at the modern art museum? First of  all there are appointments at the office. Workshops, meetings,  customer visits. This is what life feels like.I pair my smartphone with the scooter, and with a flick of my  wrist I activate the parka. Its LEDs light up. I’m quiet, but I want  to be seen. It’s all so simple and smooth.We’re off again at last. Even when I was having my breakfast, I  couldn’t wait. Not even the birds notice me. I glide almost silently  through my neighbourhood. I’m a part of the city again.People start to look at me at the traffic lights. My sitting  position is upright, relaxed. A new message flashes on the display, my  smartphone is charging in the storage compartment.Green light. With the scooter’s torque, I can float away ahead  of the rest. I’m a rocket. But a silent one.I feel as if I was on the Bonanza bike back in the day – cool  and superior, but now connected to the world and one step ahead.  Technology and style. Is this freedom? Yes – only better. No traffic  jams, no having to search for a parking space. For me, it’s all time I save.Acceleration, speed, bends – the BMW CE 04 doesn’t just master  them, it redefines them. I glide through the traffic – the seat itself  seems to float. It feels just right. Surfing bends is superbly  enjoyable. Pure fun, from wave to wave.The evening was beautiful, down by the river. We laughed a lot.  The city motorway doesn’t forgive mistakes – my scooter sprints away  and my parka glows in the dark of night. I’m clearly visible and  arrive safely at my destination. Quietly, I glide into the driveway to  my garage, again almost unnoticed by the birds. Good night, my city.  We’ll be in touch.”“The BMW CE 04 is our new electric star for the city. It    combines an e-drive with emotion and motorcycling fun. The latest    technology, and the best battery cells, which also provide power in    the BMW iX. Just like the CE 04, all future new BMW Motorrad models    for urban mobility will be pure electric.”Oliver Zipse, CEO of BMW AG.The new BMW CE 04 – the silent revolution: A new chapter in    electrically powered urban two-wheel mobility.With the new BMW CE 04, BMW Motorrad continues to consistently  pursue its electromobility strategy for urban conurbations. As the  final series production vehicle of the BMW Motorrad Concept Link  originally showcased in 2017 and the near-series BMW Motorrad  Definition CE 04 unveiled in 2020, the BMW CE 04 opens up a whole new  chapter in two-wheel urban mobility. With its electric drive,  forward-looking design and innovative connectivity solutions, the new  scooter merges transport and communication functions for a new brand  of mobility in the urban environment.Plenty of power and ample range for supreme riding in the city    and in urban areas.With a maximum output of 31 kW (42 hp), the new BMW  CE 04 has a powerful motor and offers outstanding riding pleasure. For  the classic “traffic light start” discipline from 0 to 50 km/h, it  takes just fast 2.6 seconds. Even in the reduced output L3e-A1 vehicle  class, 23 kW (31 hp) drive power is available. The maximum speed of  both versions is 120 km/h – for speedy progress not just in the city  but on main roads and motorway sections, too.The new BMW CE 04 has an ample battery cell capacity of 60.6 Ah  (8.9 kWh), providing a range of some 130 kilometres (reduced output  version: 100 km). This enables day-to-day emission-free riding in the  city, in an urban setting and for smaller-scale fun tours after work  or at the weekend – with complete peace of mind.Innovative electric drive with liquid-cooled electric motor.The new BMW CE 04 has a permanent magnet electric  motor mounted in the frame between the battery and the rear wheel, as  used in a similar form in BMW cars such as the 225xe Active Tourer.  BMW Motorrad conducted extensive riding tests to develop a specific  type of recuperation for each riding mode, giving the rider a  high-level convenience. This means that optimum performance and riding  characteristics are available in every situation on the road.Short charging times and charging technology based on the    system used in cars.The lithium-ion battery is charged using the integrated charging  device either at a regular household socket, a wallbox or a public  charging station. When the battery is completely flat, charging time  ideally lasts 4 hours and 20 minutes. With the quick charger available  as an optional extra with an output of up to 6.9 kW (2.3 kW is the  standard level), charging time is reduced to just 1 hour and 40  minutes when the battery is completely flat. If the battery level is  only 20 per cent and the battery is charged to 80 per cent, the  charging time is reduced to just 45 minutes with the optional quick  charger. Depending on the market, the standard charging cable with a  charging capacity of 2.3 kW comes as standard with the BMW CE 04.A Mode 3 charging cable is required for fast charging at the  wallbox at home or at a public charging station. In the same way as  with BMW automobiles, BMW Charging solutions are available for the BMW  CE 04, too – for maximum flexibility based on numerous customised  programmes for charging at home, on the road and at work.Increased riding stability through slip control by means of    ASC (Automatic Stability Control). DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) as    an ex works option.This traction control system is available on the new  BMW CE 04, comparable to the Automatic Stability Control in BMW  motorcycles with combustion engine. ASC limits engine torque in  relation to rear wheel slip. Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), available  as an optional extra, provides even greater riding safety. DTC enables  even more safe acceleration, especially in banking position.Three riding modes “ECO”, “Rain” and “Road” for efficient,    day-to-day use as standard. “Dynamic” riding mode for further    enhanced riding pleasure as an ex works option.In developing the BMW CE 04, BMW Motorrad attached particular  importance to providing opportunities for the rider to make an  individual choice between maximum efficiency and maximum riding fun.  Accordingly, the new BMW CE 04 features the three riding modes “ECO”,  “Rain” and “Road” as standard. The additional “Dynamic” riding mode is  also available as an ex works option, enabling the scooter to  accelerate at an even swifter pace.Directionally stable suspension with one-piece tubular steel    main frame for smooth handling and a high level of ride comfort.The main frame is a tubular steel construction. The front wheel  is controlled by a telescopic fork with a slider tube diameter of 35  mm. Rear wheel control consists of a single-sided swing arm. At the  rear, suspension and damping are performed by a directly controlled,  fully covered spring strut. The new BMW CE 04 is fitted with  generously sized tyres, with 120/70 R15 67H at the front and 160/60  R15 56H at the rear.Powerful brake system with latest-generation ABS. ABS Pro with    banking capability as an ex works option.At the front, a twin disc brake ensures secure  deceleration, supported by a single-disc system at the rear. In  addition, BMW Motorrad ABS ensures a high level of active safety. ABS  Pro, available as an optional extra, goes even further: By means of a  banking sensor, ABS Pro also controls braking on bends, thereby  offering the greatest possible safety.10.25” TFT colour screen with integrated map navigation for    convenient route planning and extensive connectivity as standard.The new BMW CE 04 comes fitted as standard with a  10.25-inch TFT colour screen with integrated map navigation and  connectivity. Its excellent readability, clear menu navigation and  highly integrated operating concept put the new BMW CE 04 at the top  of the scooter segment. For the first time, the new 10.25-inch colour  screen makes it possible to display a navigation map in the instrument  cluster, so no additional display is needed.Powerful LED lighting units all round. Adaptive Headlight Pro    and light functions as ex works options.The lighting units on the new BMW CE 04 are based on  state-of-the-art LED technology. They include a headlamp for high beam  and low beam at the front. In addition to a rear light featuring LED  technology, there are also LED turn indicators. The indicator lamps  likewise use LED technology. Even greater safety at night is offered  by the adaptive turning light Headlight Pro, available as an ex works  option. Here, the rider benefits from further improved illumination of  the road when cornering for even safer riding at night. Special light  functions such as “Welcome” and “Good Bye” are also available as ex  works options.Future-oriented design and colour scheme.The new BMW CE 04 embodies a new, forward-looking  form of urban two-wheeled mobility in its design as well, featuring an  innovative style that arouses emotions for this new drive technology  while instantly identifying the scooter as a member of the BMW  Motorrad family. The modern surface finish is in a striking Light  White, complemented by matt black sections in the front and side areas  as well as the “floating” seat. In addition, there are trend-setting  wheels (solid wheels) featuring a disc-wheel look and a side stand  that is integrated in the design styling. The new BMW CE 04 in  Avantgarde Style (ex works option) is a striking, colourful statement  of contemporary urban mobility. In this style, the colour Magellan  Grey metallic is supplemented with a black/orange seat, an orange wind  deflector and various graphics.“The new BMW CE 04 is the logical and at the same time    rethought continuation of BMW Motorrad’s electromobility strategy.    Urban conurbations are its element. This is where it sets a new    benchmark – in terms of both technology and visual style.” Florian    Roemhild, Project Manager BMW CE 04.The highlights of the new BMW CE 04:;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Three colours, three roofs, endless individualisation: the MINI Multitone Roof.;New design feature, unique in the competitive environment, is offered for the MINI 3-door, the MINI 5-door and the MINI Clubman. Innovative painting process at the MINI plant in Oxford enables a three-colour design of the roof, which sets visual accents in the typical style of the British premium brand.;Munich. MINI has a long tradition of colour  diversity. A contrasting paint finish for the roof once helped the  classic Mini to achieve a particularly expressive appearance and has  continued to set attractive visual accents in various colour tones  since the launch of the modern MINI 20 years ago. With the exclusive  Multitone Roof, the individualisation of the MINI exterior achievable  by means of paintwork now reaches a whole new dimension. For the first  time, an innovative wet-on-wet painting process is being used at the  MINI plant in Oxford, UK, to create a three-colour design for the  vehicle roof.The pioneer for the innovative form of roof design is the MINI Cooper  SE (power consumption combined: 17.6 - 15.2 kWh/100 km according to  WLTP, 16.9 - 14.9 kWh/100 km according to NEDC). For the first time,  the Multitone Roof was offered as part of the MINI Electric Collection  for the British premium brand's all-electric model, which was  presented alongside the world premiere of the latest new edition of  MINI's small car models. In the meantime, the Multitone Roof, which is  unique worldwide in the mass production of automobiles, is available  as an optional extra for both the premium small cars MINI 3-door and  MINI 5-door as well as for the MINI Clubman, which is successful in  the premium compact segment.The visual highlight of the new design feature is the flowing  gradient between the three colour tones selected for the Multitone  Roof. From the dark San Marino Blue in the front section of the  vehicle's roof, the colour scheme gently transitions to the lighter  shade of Pearly Aqua, then just as smoothly to Jet Black in the rear  section. The unique aesthetic created by this colour gradient is also  easily recognisable in conjunction with the optional panoramic glass  roof as well as the optional roof rails. The colour scheme of the  Multitone Roof forms an interplay that is as appealing as it is  harmonious with almost all the body paint finishes available for the  MINI 3-door, the MINI 5-door and the MINI Clubman. It is therefore  available in combination with all exterior colours with the exception  of the Chili Red uni and British Racing Green metallic variants as  well as the Indian Summer Red metallic available for the MINI Clubman.With the contrasting paint for the roof, the characteristic  three-part division of the MINI body is emphasised particularly  intensively. The horizontal structure of vehicle body, glass passenger  cell and roof is a design principle typical of the brand. The design  of the roof becomes an expression of personal style. Depending on the  model variant, contrasting paint finishes in white, black and silver  are offered as optional equipment ex works. A red-painted roof is also  available for the John Cooper Works models. In addition, the MINI  Original Accessories range includes roof decors in various designs -  from the Union Jack to the Checkered Flag design - for retrofitting.The expansion of the range of contrasting paint finishes to include  the Multitone Roof is made possible by the introduction of a new type  of painting technique at the British MINI plant in Oxford. There, the  light colour Pearly Aqua is first applied to the roof of the  correspondingly configured vehicles. In further steps, San Marino Blue  is applied to the front of the roof and Jet Black to the rear,  creating the flowing colour gradients characteristic of the Multitone  Roof. The innovative painting process is fully integrated into the  automated production process at the MINI plant in Oxford.  Nevertheless, slight deviations in the colour pattern occur due to  changing environmental conditions, so that each MINI with a Multitone  Roof is already given the character of a unique specimen by the  painting process at the factory . In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product  Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com Fuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption were    measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC)    2007/715 as amended.

Jubilant scenes at Donington Park: BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team celebrates first three WorldSBK podiums for the new BMW M 1000 RR.;A good Saturday was followed by a great Sunday at Donington Park. BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team celebrated the first three podiums in the FIM Superbike World Championship for the new BMW M 1000 RR. In the morning’s Superpole race, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) finished second and third to record a double podium, while Sykes finished third in the afternoon’s second main race to reach the rostrum once again.;Donington Park. A good Saturday was followed by a great Sunday    at Donington Park (GBR). BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team celebrated the first three podiums in the FIM    Superbike World Championship for the new BMW M 1000 RR. In the    morning’s Superpole race, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark    (NED) finished second and third to record a double podium, while    Sykes finished third in the afternoon’s second main race to reach    the rostrum once again. Van der Mark crossed the finish line in a    good fifth place. Donington Park hosted round four of the 2021    WorldSBK season.  The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had laid the foundations for Sunday’s  success in Superpole qualifying on Saturday, as van der Mark and Sykes  began the Superpole race in the morning from second and third places  on the grid. Rain showers made a brief appearance before the sprint  race but the circuit dried out quickly. In common with much of the  field, both BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team riders went with intermediate  tyres. They both initially dropped back by one place on the first lap  but regained those positions on lap two and did not surrender them  thereafter. After ten laps, Sykes finished second and van der Mark  third to secure not just the first WorldSBK podium for the new M RR,  but a double podium finish. As the Superpole race decided the grid for race two that afternoon,  they had a great start position with both riders back on the front row  again, Sykes in second and van der Mark in third. Sykes exited the  first turns in third place, staying in touch with leading duo Jonathan  Rea (GBR / Kawasaki) and Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR / Yamaha). Sykes  dropped back to fourth place for a short while around the halfway  point of the race, but the BMW rider moved back to third after a fall  for leader Rea. He then defended until the chequered flag was waved  after 23 laps - celebrating his second podium finish of the day. Van  der Mark lost ground at the start but moved back into fifth place on  lap 16 to secure another top five finish. Eugene Laverty (IRL) crossed the finish line in twelfth place in the  Superpole race on the BMW M 1000 RR of BMW satellite team RC Squadra  Corse. He finished 15th in race two, scoring another world  championship point. Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team  Bonovo MGM Racing claimed 16th place in the morning’s sprint race. He  then retired early from the afternoon race as the quickshifter did not  work properly. Quotes after race two at Donington Park. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  are very happy. It’s very good to get this under the belt, it takes  away a bit of the pressure when we focus on the next rounds. As I said  yesterday, there is still some work to do. I was hoping for some rain  today but it didn’t come in the afternoon. So it was very, very good  to confirm our performance in a full dry race on slicks as we were  definitely not as competitive in such conditions in the last race and  also at the beginning of this weekend. Overall, to come away with  three podiums is of course very, very pleasing. This is something we  can build on. Crucial for this weekend was definitely our Superpole  qualifying because if you look at the pace of the others you know that  you could easily be sixth, seventh or eighth if you are not in that  front row. Now it’s time to settle down, look at the data, gather our  thoughts and make the next step.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It was a fantastic day. It’s our home track, the home round  for Tom and us, so it was a sensational day for all. I think we  stepped up. We’ve come back from a really disappointing Misano round,  we have reacted. In the sprint race, there were changeable conditions  and almost everyone went for intermediate tyres which was the right  decision. Then in race two, with dry conditions, all started on slicks  and it shows the step we have made with the BMW M 1000 RR. We were  literally a few seconds off the win. We always were in contention for  the podium and Tom did a fantastic race and Michael was not far behind  him. He withstood the pressure from Alex Lowes on the Kawasaki and  brought the bike home in a strong fifth. Now we all are looking  forward to Michael’s home round at Assen.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Credit to the  whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. We have come here, tried to just  assess the situation after the Navarra test and really, I am happy. I  was training at the beginning of the week and when I came to my house  and got off my pushbike, I knew: this is the weekend. Considering what  we learned at Navarra I would be going to drag the thing around  Donington Park if I have to. On Friday, I was pushing the boundaries  and went to the deck twice. Normally I ride to the limit and stop just  like I did today in the race. The guys did an incredible job, giving  me a perfect bike in terms of what we had available in our tool box so  I think we got the best from our package this weekend. Still, we need  to improve but this is a whole confidence boost for the team and me.  It gives everyone what they deserve. And what’s really nice is that we  had two BMWs, myself and Michael, on the front row in wet conditions  and then with the intermediates in tricky conditions, we were on the  podium again - both BMWs, second and third. Then in that last race, it  was tricky in the beginning but ultimately a dry race on a different  rear tyre. I am not really sure if I am happy with the tyre I chose  but we dug deep and the tyre gave us a podium so for this I am happy.  Hopefully now we can continue with the information we have and try to  keep improving.”                                                          Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We  had a really good Sunday. It was nice this morning in the Superpole  race. The track was a little bit tricky so early everyone went on  intermediates and it was the right choice. I really enjoyed it. It was  good to finish on the podium together with Tom. Then in race two I had  quite a good feeling but I just struggled too much in changing  directions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Saturday at Donington Park: the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team secures two front row positions and records two top-five finishes.;The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team gave a strong performance to start off the fourth event of the season in the 2021 WorldSBK at Donington Park (GBR). In Superpole on Saturday morning, Michael van der Mark (NED) and Tom Sykes (GBR) claimed second and third places on their BMW M 1000 RRs to secure spots on the front row of the grid. Both riders crossed the finish line in the top five in the afternoon’s first race. Sykes was in fourth and van der Mark in fifth.;Donington Park. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team gave a strong    performance to start off the fourth event of the season in the 2021    FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Donington Park (GBR).    In Superpole on Saturday morning, Michael van der Mark (NED) and Tom    Sykes (GBR) claimed second and third places on their BMW M 1000 RRs    to secure spots on the front row of the grid. Both riders crossed    the finish line in the top five in the afternoon’s first race. Sykes    was in fourth and van der Mark in fifth. The weather at Donington Park took a typically British turn on  Saturday morning. Rain set in for the second free practice session in  the morning and the circuit was still moist for Superpole. That did  not prevent van der Mark and Sykes from recording some impressive  times to keep pace with the leaders, putting both BMW Motorrad  WorldSBK Team BMW M 1000 RRs on the front row of the grid. The rain had stopped by the time the race started in the afternoon  and the circuit was gradually drying. Van der Mark and Sykes were able  to defend second and third positions after the start lights went out.  They swapped places twice in the opening stage, before settling into  third (van der Mark) and fourth (Sykes) until the halfway point of the  race. Both were part of a group battling for the lead on lap twelve,  but then van der Mark had light contact with Alex Lowes (GBR /  Kawasaki), ran wide and fell back to sixth place. Sykes initially  moved into third place before crossing the line in fourth, immediately  ahead of fifth-placed van der Mark, after 23 laps. Eugene Laverty (IRL), competing for the BMW satellite team RC Squadra  Corse, secured 15th place on the grid in Superpole. Laverty had moved  up to twelfth by the halfway point of the race. He then dropped down  one place in the closing stage and took the chequered flag in 13th  position. Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM  Racing endured a difficult Saturday. He started from 20th place and  then problems when changing gear forced him to head for the pits and  retire just before the end of the race. Quotes after race one at Donington Park. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Overall, we are very happy after an extremely difficult  Misano weekend. At the same time, we need to keep our feet on the  ground as there is still quite a big gap to the very front. But for  sure, second and third places in qualifying were well deserved with  strong performances of both Michael and Tom in the wet. Of course, we  would have hoped for a podium as the first half of the race looked  like it but we just couldn’t keep that. To bring home fourth and fifth  is definitely satisfying. Tomorrow is another day and we start again  from the front row of the grid. It looks like it will rain tomorrow  but if we can repeat what we did today I would be very pleased with  the weekend.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We were glad first of all that it was a slick race for  everybody. We would rather be it be totally wet or totally dry. We  were at a good level, and we could show the progress we have made with  the new BMW M 1000 RR. We can’t be disappointed with fourth and fifth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

“Chef of the Century” Eckart Witzigmann turns 80.;BMW Group congratulates Eckart Witzigmann on his birthday  Symposium  “What does sustainability taste like?“ online available  ECKART 2021 awarded to a pioneering project ;Munich. The BMW Group and „Chef of the Century”  Eckart Witzigmann have been allied in their shared commitment to the  art of cooking, deliberate consumption and social responsibility for a  long time. This year, the BMW Group will honour its companion of many  years on the occasion of his important anniversary and present the  jubilarian with a unusual gift – a ECKART Symposium. Following the  theme “What does sustainability taste like?“ a series of several panel  debates featuring first-class experts will focus on important  questions of our time. Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management at BMW AG, Human  Resources and Labour Relations Director, commented on the special  anniversary, „Happy birthday, dear Mr Witzigmann! Our symposium is  just a little token of our appreciation to mark our long-standing  partnership. From its inception, we have kept in mind our common goal,  namely the promotion of healthy eating, sustainable culinary art and  responsible use of resources and continue to work towards it to this  day. Good, healthy food that is produced and prepared in a sustainable  manner is one of the greatest challenges of our time. A challenge that  reflects how we at the BMW Group understand and live sustainability.  New impulses are key to company catering and fine dining alike. Hand  in hand, we are developing and promoting ideas to ensure real change.  I would like to express my most sincere gratitude to Mr Witzigmann for  his continued commitment to the cause.” Hosted by Dr Christoph Wirtz, editor in chief at restaurant guide  Gault&Millau Germany, the very first interdisciplinary round table  on quality and sustainability will be a platform for debate welcoming  participants head of human resources Ilka Horstmeier, Norbert  Niederkofler, winner of the ECKART 2020 for innovation and Steffi  Czerny, CEO DLD Media GmbH. “Quality” has an interesting double  meaning. Used in its literal sense, the term denotes the sum of all  qualities of any given product. As users, however, we tend to  interpret the term as having a value and attach it to upmarket and  premium products. If we furthermore combine the term “quality” with  the idea of sustainability, we also bring into question its origin,  the way it was produced and the social conditions surrounding its  production, its transport and sale as well as its final use and  processing. The same is true for food products and vehicles and even  digital products. At the roundtable, the participants will explore at  what point food and other products can be considered sustainable and  what exactly that implies. And if sustainability is to be understood  as the basis of new, circular business activities, there is a need to  develop new business models. In the next panel Martin Straubinger, head of BMW Group Company  Catering, Barbara Jung-Arntz, journalist, and Jürgen Mäder, CEO Edeka  Südwest, will debate a range of issues including transport routes,  distribution, quality and cost of our food. Mr Straubinger said, “In  line with our overall strategy regarding sustainability at the BMW  Group, the department of company catering is a proactive agent in the  process and continuously improves its relevant practices. To that end,  we routinely examine all processes such as the local sourcing of  products, animal welfare, the optimisation of delivery routes and the  use of sustainable materials as well as the reduction and prevention  of waste. No small feat, keeping in mind the enormous number of meals  – 42,000 – that cross our counters every day at the various BMW  locations in both Germany and Austria.” The third panel will feature Jürgen Molter, head of catering at the  BMW sites in Dingolfing, Regensburg, Landshut and Steyr, Nathalie  Leblond, head chef at restaurant “Les Deux”, Dr Stefan Hartmann,  president of the German Institute of Company Catering (DIG) and  Patrick Auer, head of company catering at the Bavarian Association of  Insurers debating the similarities and differences of fine dining and  company catering. What expectations do they need to meet respectively  and what can the two disciplines learn from each other? At the end of  the day, fine dining is most appreciated where people make the choice  of eating both healthy and well and where most meals cross the counter  – at staff canteens. In the final panel, Maximilian Schöberl,  Head of BMW Group Corporate and Intergovernmental Affairs, and Eckart  Witzigmann will talk about a future collaboration close to their heart  launched on the occasion of the 80th birthday of the “Chef  of the Century”. Donated by the ECKART Academy, named after the  century chef Eckart Witzigmann, and endowed with a prize money of  50,000 Euro by the BMW Group, the ECKART 2021 will be awarded to a  pioneering project. The project was co-founded by the oncological  center of excellence Klinik Bad Trissl, a major partner of Munich’s  universities as well as Bavaria’s leading treatment center for tumor  patients and Munich’s most awarded chef Jan Hartwig. Together, they  harness their expertise in fine dining to develop healthy diets for  both patients and staff. To give an initial boost to the project, Prof Dr Volkmar Nüssler  (MD), Executive Coordinator at Munich Tumor Centre (TMZ), responsible  for the medical side of “Proof of Concept”, will provide scientific  support while the business side of the project will be headed by  Prof Dr Nicole Graf, Chancellor of DHBW university. The symposium will be recorded prior to the  80th anniversary of Eckart Witzigmann and made available  online at https://eckart-foodlab.com. The ECKARTThe BMW Group and ECKART Academy have been partners since 2012 and  together they award the Eckart Witzigmann Prize for outstanding  achievements in the field of gastronomy. Based on their shared  commitment to healthy eating, sustainable cuisine and the responsible  use of resources, the partnership supports social and sustainable  projects. Previous winners of the award include Daniel Boulud, HRH  Charles Prince of Wales, Elena Arzak, Anne-Sophie Pic, Harald  Wohlfahrt, Dieter Kosslick, Ferran Adrià, Marc Haeberlin, Joël  Robuchon, Alex Atala, Jon Rose, Mick Hucknall, Massimo Bottura,  Dominique Crenn, Andreas Caminada, Tiffany Persons, María Marte and  Alain Ducasse.

Series production of BMW iX* gets underway at Plant Dingolfing;Highest standards of flexibility: All drive train variants on one line  Successful transformation of BMW Group plants towards e-mobility and digitalisation  Half of Dingolfing's production volume will be electrified by mid-decade  Nedeljković: “setting ourselves ambitious goals for the most sustainable production”;Highest standards of flexibility: All drive train variants on one  line  Successful transformation of BMW Group plants towards  e-mobility and digitalisation  Half of Dingolfing's production  volume will be electrified by mid-decade  Nedeljković: “setting  ourselves ambitious goals for the most sustainable production” Dingolfing. Standard production of the fully-electric  BMW iX* began today in Dingolfing. The plant in Lower Bavaria now  produces vehicles with all drive train variants, i.e.  combustion-engine vehicles, plug-in hybrids and fully-electric models,  on a single line. Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management  of BMW AG, responsible for Production: “The launch of the BMW iX*  marks another milestone in our expansion of electrification and  demonstrates our production network's successful transformation  towards electromobility and digitalisation.” The BMW iX* is being manufactured at the BMW Group’s largest European  production plant on an assembly line with the flexibility to build a  mix of BMW 5 Series, 7 Series and 8 Series models. To handle this  flexibility and variety of drive trains, vehicle assembly in  Dingolfing has been expanded and refurbished. The BMW Group has  invested a total of more than 400 million euros in producing the BMW  iX* at the Dingolfing vehicle plant. Many of the remodelling and  structural measures required for the BMW iX* are already benefiting  future generations of the BMW 7 Series and 5 Series that will come off  the production line in Dingolfing in the coming years. Fully-electric  variants have also been announced for both model ranges. Half of production volume already electrified by mid-decadeWith the BMW iX* and other PHEV models at Plant Dingolfing alone, the  BMW Group plans to double the percentage of electrified vehicles  produced this year compared to 2020. By the middle of the decade, half  the vehicles produced in Dingolfing will be electrified. The new model  will play an important part in this. “The BMW iX* will already be one  of the highest-volume model at the location by next year,” according  to Nedeljković. The BMW iX* will be followed in the autumn by the BMW  i4*, which will be built in Munich. At the end of next year, all  German plants will be producing at least one fully-electric vehicle. Broad know-how: Vehicle and e-drive production on siteProduction of the BMW iX* in Dingolfing benefits from broad know-how  and expertise in the technologies located at the site. Close  interaction between these different areas enables a high level of  in-house activity and short lines of communication, as well as  ensuring optimum production technology overall. The fully-electric  heart of the BMW iX* – the highly integrated e-drive and  fifth-generation battery, as well as the complete electric axle are  produced on site, together with the Dingolfing component plants.  Production capacity will be systematically expanded and, from 2022,  Dingolfing will be able to produce e-drives for more than half a  million electrified vehicles. BMW iX* as trailblazer The BMW iX* introduces a multitude of innovations to the product and  production processes at the plant – especially in the vehicle’s  electrical system architecture, software, digital services,  connectivity and automated driving functions. As a result, the vehicle  plays an important role as a trailblazer and is making Dingolfing  “e-car” and “smart-car ready” as the BMW Group’s primary plant for the  luxury class. The BMW iX* is also an important trailblazer in production, bringing  future technologies into the production system – such as digital  methods for employee training, automation of logistics processes,  virtual commissioning and validation of driver assistance systems. Christoph Schröder, head of BMW Group Plant Dingolfing: “As the  primary plant for the luxury class, our location produces the BMW  Group’s technology flagship. It is once again proving itself as a  pioneer for the mobility of tomorrow and as the industry leader in key  future areas of automotive activity, such as electrification,  digitalisation and sustainability. In this way, the BMW iX* is  continuing the successful transformation of the BMW Group location in  Dingolfing that began long ago.” Special focus on sustainabilityThe topic of sustainability is firmly anchored throughout the  company. A particular focus is on improving our carbon footprint –  especially in production of electric vehicles. Independent auditors  have confirmed that the greenhouse gas potential of the BMW iX  xDrive40* is around 45 percent lower than that of a comparable Sports  Activity Vehicle with an internal combustion engine. “We are already  the sustainability benchmark for our industry. But we will continue to  invest in resource-saving technologies and set ourselves ambitious  goals for the most sustainable production,” underlined head of  Production Milan Nedeljković. The BMW Group takes a holistic approach  to reducing CO2 emissions and minimising resource  consumption that covers the entire value chain, including production  as well as the supply chain and use phase. The BMW Group has already succeeded in lowering resource consumption  per vehicle produced by more than half between 2006 and 2020.  CO2 emissions have been reduced even more significantly –  by as much as 78 percent. The aim is to reduce CO2  emissions per vehicle produced by another 80 percent by 2030. “To  achieve this, we have made some changes at Plant Dingolfing and  implemented a series of new measures,” says plant director Christoph  Schröder. For example, the BMW iX* is produced exclusively using  regional and directly sourced green power from two hydroelectric power  plants located on the Isar and Lech rivers. The entire plant, like all  BMW Group locations, will also be net carbon neutral from this year,  through the use of corresponding offsets and certificates. Other aspects of sustainability range from energy-efficient  installations to packaging planning, through transport logistics and  recycling, up to and including topics such as biodiversity and water  management. Plant Dingolfing is therefore able to achieve a recycling  rate of more than 90 percent and an even higher recoverability rate of  over 99 percent. The plant’s own wells meet over 40 percent of its  water needs, thereby helping conserve the region’s drinking water  reserves. The BMW Group has already reduced its water consumption by  more than 30 percent overall since 2006. BMW iX* as catalyst for change: Active shift in competence. The BMW iX* creates a need for additional training beyond the  extensive experience and expertise that is already available. It is  accelerating the shift in competence already taking place within the  production network and helping prepare the workforce for the demands  of a new era. In this way, employee development across the entire  company is being geared towards digitalisation and e-mobility. As part  of the biggest training offensive in the company’s history, 75,000  staff are being trained in future areas of activity. In Dingolfing alone, more than 4,000 employees have moved to jobs  with strong future prospects since 2012. A current example of this is  the creation and expansion of the Competence Centre for E-Drive  Production at the location, which doubled its staff numbers last year  from 600 to 1,200. This number is likely to increase to over 1,900 by  the end of the year.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Alessandro Zanardi: The recovery process of a real fighter.;One year has passed since Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) suffered severe injuries in a handbike accident in Italy in June 2020. It has been a year in which the BMW brand ambassador is once more showing his fighting spirit and is working his way back, even if it is a long way. In this interview, his wife Daniela Zanardi reports on his recovery process.;Munich. One year has passed since Alessandro Zanardi (ITA)    suffered severe injuries in a handbike accident in Italy in June    2020. It has been a year in which the BMW brand ambassador is once    more showing his fighting spirit and is working his way back, even    if it is a long way. In this interview, his wife Daniela Zanardi    reports on his recovery process.  Daniela, how is Alex these days? Daniela Zanardi: “One year after the accident, Alex’s condition is  essentially stable. He is currently in a special clinic, where he is  undergoing a rehabilitation programme. This includes multimodal and  pharmacological stimulations under the guidance of doctors,  physiotherapists, neuropsychologists and speech therapists to try to  facilitate his recovery.” A long time has passed since the last update on Alex’s health.    Is there a specific reason for this release? Zanardi: “We have received so many best wishes for his recovery, and  I would like to take this opportunity to say a big thank you, on  behalf of Alex, for every single message. Following consultations with  the doctors, now appears to be an appropriate time to offer this small  insight into Alex’s recovery process with this interview. I would like  to tell all those people who are thinking of and praying for Alex that  he is fighting – as he always has done. The affection we have received  from friends, fans, acquaintances, athletes and those involved in  motorsport over the past year has been nothing short of touching and  overwhelming and has been of enormous support for us in dealing with  all this. However, a very special thank you goes to the medical personnel.” How can you describe Alex’s development since the accident? Zanardi: “It has been a very complex process that has required more  neurosurgery and been characterised by a number of setbacks. Alex is  in a stable condition, which means he is able to undergo training  programmes for both his brain and his body. He can communicate with  us, but he is still unable to speak. After a long time in a coma, the  vocal cords must regain their elasticity. This is only possible  through practice and therapy. He still has a lot of strength in his  arms and hands, and is training intensively on the equipment.” What are your expectations for the future? Zanardi: “It is certainly another huge challenge. It is a very long  journey and at the moment no predictions are made on when he will be  able to return home. We put all our energy in Alex’s recovery.  Therefore we decided to use this interview as a unique opportunity to  inform the public on his recovery status and answer some frequently  asked questions. We appreciate everyone’s understanding that we will  leave it at that for the moment.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I am very much looking forward to experiencing the  open-air concert again and seeing Sir Simon Rattle and all the  musicians back on stage.”“I’m delighted that Sir Simon Rattle and the London Symphony  Orchestra will return to Trafalgar Square this August to put on a free  concert alongside young London musicians. Outdoor classical concerts  are a great way to enjoy music, and this performance will be a real  treat. It’s a highlight of my Let’s Do London domestic tourism  campaign, which is welcoming people back to safely enjoy the amazing  culture on offer in London”, said the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.Composer Ayanna Witter-Johnson: “’DreamCity’ was a  fantastic collaborative project for me;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MINI Vision Urbanaut. The virtual vision becomes a tangible reality.;With the presentation of the MINI Vision Urbanaut virtual vision vehicle in November 2020, the MINI brand revealed an all-new interpretation of mobility through an innovative vision of space. And now the BMW Group is set to unveil a physical model of the vehicle which will allow audiences to engage more extensively with the spatial concept and sustainable materials at work. The model will be given its world premiere on 1 July 2021 at the DLD Summer.;Munich. With the presentation of the MINI Vision  Urbanaut virtual vision vehicle in November 2020, the MINI brand  revealed an all-new interpretation of mobility through an innovative  vision of space. And now the BMW Group is set to unveil a physical  model of the vehicle which will allow audiences to engage more  extensively with the spatial concept and sustainable materials at  work. The model will be given its world premiere on 1 July 2021 at the  DLD Summer conference in Munich.“At MINI we see it as our responsibility to preserve and develop the  unique characteristics of our brand over the upcoming years and those  further ahead,” explains Bernd Körber, Head of MINI. “With our eyes  fixed on the future, we have developed an idea, with the MINI Vision  Urbanaut, of how we can take the MINI attributes – as here, with the  focus on the ‘Clever Use of Space’ – into the future of mobility and  interpret them in a typically MINI way. It brings the user’s personal  space into the car and opens up various possibilities for them, from  creating an urban oasis to experiencing freedom in the ‘Wanderlust’  moment. The MINI Vision Urbanaut represents our image of how MINI’s  ‘Clever Use of Space’ could provide an answer to the needs of future  cities and lifestyles.”Oliver Heilmer, Head of MINI Design adds: “At MINI Design we believe  that the best way to understand the overall concept behind the MINI  Vision Urbanaut is to experience it. The feeling of space and the  innovative materials are just asking to be explored. That is why it  was very important for us from the outset to also make a physical  model of the MINI Vision Urbanaut. And now that moment has come. We  have planned and built every aspect of the model – which allows people  to experience all of the facets of the MINI Vision Urbanaut – at our  MINI Design Studio in Munich.“ Extending the idea of mobility beyond driving – the MINI moments.MINI sees its future self primarily as an enabler of and companion  for unforgettable times, what we’re calling “MINI moments”. Inspired  by the question “What kind of experiences do I want to have with my  vehicle?”, they provide the conceptual platform for the MINI Vision  Urbanaut – for times when you’re travelling and others when you’re  not. What this means more specifically is encapsulated up by the MINI  moments “Chill”, “Wanderlust” and “Vibe”. The exterior and interior of  the vehicle change to reflect the MINI moment at hand and so give the  on-board experience the best possible stage and spatial environment.  Fragrance, sound and ambient lighting continue to enrich the baseline  mood initiated by the chosen MINI moment. The transformation of the  vehicle through the different moments can now also be experienced in  stunning reality thanks to the creation of a physical model of the  MINI Vision Urbanaut.The Chill moment invites you to catch a breath and pause in the here  and now. The car becomes a kind of retreat, a haven where you can  relax or work with full concentration. While the rear seat bench (Cosy  Corner) invites various seating and lying positions, the backlit Loop  above it takes on an appearance inspired by a green forest canopy and  can also be dimmed. In the central area, the circular instrument folds  down to become a table lamp, eliminating displays or switches that  might remind the customer of their automotive surroundings.Wanderlust is the only MINI moment where the MINI Vision Urbanaut is  being driven or driving with automated driving functions. In this  moment, the interior becomes the ideal place for driving the car, or  being driven by it, and enables those on board to rediscover the  romance of travel. When the customer wants to drive themselves, a tap  of a finger on the MINI logo brings out the steering wheel and pedals.  And the user interface on the central circular instrument also adapts  its visuals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Donington Park is the next stop for BMW Motorrad Motorsport in the WorldSBK.;Donington Park (GBR) is the next stop for BMW Motorrad Motorsport in the FIM Superbike World Championship. The fourth round of the 2021 WorldSBK season will take place this coming weekend (2nd to 4th July) at the historic circuit in the heart of England.;Munich. Donington Park (GBR) is the next stop for BMW Motorrad    Motorsport in the FIM Superbike World Championship. The fourth round    of the 2021 WorldSBK season will take place this coming weekend (2nd    to 4th July) at the historic circuit in the heart of England. The    BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team will once again be competing with riders    Michael van der Mark (NED) and Tom Sykes (GBR), as well as Eugene    Laverty (IRL) and Jonas Folger (GER) for the BMW satellite teams RC    Squadra Corse and Bonovo MGM Racing.  After the third round at Misano (ITA), WorldSBK took a short break  with no races taking place over two weekends. BMW Motorrad Motorsport  used that time for two days of testing at Navarra (ESP). The Spanish  circuit has been added to the calendar this year and will host the  seventh race event of the season from 20th to 22nd August. The tests  provided an opportunity to continue development of the new BMW M 1000  RR, while simultaneously becoming familiar with the characteristics of  the circuit. The focus now switches to the upcoming weekend at Donington Park. The  very first WorldSBK race took place on this track in April 1988.  Donington has been a fixture on the calendar since then, even though  the event had to be cancelled last year due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Quotes ahead of the Donington round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  first three events of the season showed us what areas we need to work  on with our new BMW M 1000 RR, and we did that during testing at  Navarra, among other things. We tried out and evaluated a few new  parts in the chassis area, for example. Now we are looking forward to  the race weekend at Donington Park. That is a traditional, old-school  circuit and the layout has a really challenging mix of everything.  There are fast, fluid sections as well as hairpin bends, climbs and  slopes. We will see how well our M RR copes with this track. We are  excited to see what the weather will be like at the weekend, as that  can always be an unpredictable factor at Donington.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We’re looking forward to coming to the UK round of the World  Superbike Championship. The Navarra test was quite conclusive for us.  We have a better direction with the chassis after the chassis work  both Tom and Michael have done. Hopefully we can transfer some of that  into the Donington event. The forecast for the Donington event is  quite changeable. Friday is fair weather but Saturday and Sunday it  looks like we have some wet weather appearing just right during the  mid-days. So we could be racing in changeable conditions with  potential pit stops so we need to be ready for that eventuality.  Overall as a team, we are in a good position, disappointed from Misano  for sure, but we need to put things right for Donington and hopefully  we can do just this.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was good to have a test at Navarra, not only as we race there later  this year, but also as we had faced some problems at Misano and BMW  responded very quick so we had some new parts to Navarra test. I was  happy with the test; it is fast and  flowing and a really exciting section of the track. The last part does  not really fit to that but there you have some really good overtaking  opportunities so the circuit is exciting in two very different ways.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “For me, the  Navarra test was good for a number of reasons. First and foremost it  was to continue the development of the new BMW M 1000 RR. We had some  items that we needed to confirm there and we were able to do that.  Then it was great to learn the circuit and get some data there for  when we go back in August for the races. Now I am obviously looking  forward to my home race at Donington. I’ve had a lot of success there  in the past and I really hope that we can find the set-up to enable me  to be more consistent and stronger over the race weekend. We need to  work on finding those last little items now to put us in that  position. The new M RR has had a big step in terms of engine and  braking performance and quite a number of other things so we just need  to find the last part of the jigsaw so we can use all of this. I am  looking forward to going there and fingers crossed we can have some  good British weather. But we take what we get and try to get a strong result.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “The three-week  break has given me a chance to recover fully from my Misano crash. I  feel fit and ready to get back in the mix. The majority of the  Donington circuit has a flowing nature and that suits the BMW M 1000  RR well. That said, we will continue to work on our weak area of  braking because that’s where the races are often decided at Donington  Park. Three hard braking areas finish the lap and that will be the  main focus of our work during Friday practice in order to be ready for  the races.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I am already  looking forward to Donington, even though it has been a while since I  was there last – 13 years. As far as I can remember, it is a cool  track. Donington is a real classic on the racing calendar. I hope that  we can take another step forward after testing at Navarra and that we  can improve.”  Track Facts Donington Park.Circuit        length4.023          km – clockwiseCorners12 – 7 right-handers, 5 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight550          metres (start-finish straight)Grip levelMediumTrack        layoutFluid, fast turns; hard braking zones;" climbs          and descentsStrain on        brakesMediumAmount at full        throttle38 %Top speed / lowest        speed277          km/h / 45 km/hBest overtaking        opportunityT1, T9, T11Key        factorsHigh          speeds through the turns, stability and feel on brakes when          leaning, courage """;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Julien Creuzet selected for BMW Art Journey 2021.  Multimedia artist returns to his roots in Martinique working together with artists, musicians, and filmmakers. ;Art Basel and BMW are delighted to present Julien Creuzet as the BMW Art Journey winner 2021. An international jury selected him unanimously from a shortlist of three artists represented by galleries who were originally selected for this year’s Art Basel in Hong Kong. Julien Creuzet is represented by the gallery High Art, Paris. ;Munich/Basel. Art Basel and BMW are delighted to  present Julien Creuzet as the BMW Art Journey winner  2021. An international jury selected him unanimously from a shortlist  of three artists represented by galleries who were originally selected  for this year’s Art Basel in Hong Kong. Julien Creuzet is represented  by the gallery High Art, Paris. The BMW Art Journey is part of BMW  Group’s global cultural engagement celebrating its 50th  anniversary this year. Committed in the fields of modern and  contemporary art, classical music, jazz and sound as well as  architecture and design, the BMW Group has been an integral part of  culture on a global scale.For Julien Creuzet, a member of the Caribbean diaspora in Paris, the  BMW Art Journey – the tenth in the series – will mark a return to his  ancestral home, a place he calls “the heart of my imagination.” In a  poetic journey that intertwines personal discovery with profound  environmental concern and a generous spirit of sharing, he will center  his travels around a geographically and culturally distinct region. In  Martinique, he will work closely with a community of  art students from Fort-de-France, as well as musicians and filmmakers.  His plans include creating hybrid sculptures of Antillean fauna as  well as plastic and industrial objects, in a gesture of circularity.  In Guadeloupe, he will film underwater scenes as well  as obtain aerial visuals with drones. Often neglected in the  metropolitan imagination, the Antilles are not just homeland for  Creuzet but a site inviting consideration of the legacies of  colonialism, conflict, and marginalization. During his journey,  Creuzet will meet with cultural actors and collect visual materials  and music for a “Caribbean road movie” that merges fiction and  documentary, augmented by poetry and 3-D art.“I am really excited to be the winner of the BMW Art Journey:  It is  a great chance to reconnect with the heart of my imagination and my  Native land. This journey will allow me to collaborate with local  artists, writers, poets, musicians, students and then setting up a  real environment in Martinique,” says Julien Creuzet.Members of the international expert jury are Claire  Hsu, Director, Asia Art  Archive, Hong Kong; Philip Tinari, Director, UCCA Center for Contemporary  Art, Beijing; and Samson Young, artist and winner of the  first BMW Art Journey. “Julien Creuzet’s journey is not a trip to a distant and unknown  destination, but rather a return to a familiar place – a place of  family, youth, and education,” the jury noted, reaching its unanimous  decision. “The project rethinks mobility, the climate crisis, and  societal shifts in the wake of Covid-19. Focusing on a single  location, Creuzet underscores the importance of the local and of  reconnecting with one’s roots. His journey combines histories with  fantasies, and ancestral connections with cosmopolitanism. We were  impressed by the generosity of his project, how it makes space for  other artists – a gesture of care and humility that’s in keeping with  our healing moment.”In addition to Julien Creuzet, the shortlisted artists for the BMW  Art Journey 2021 were: Kelvin Kyun Kun Park  (represented by Vanguard Gallery, Shanghai) and Alice  Wang (represented by Capsule Shanghai).Launched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a  collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and  support emerging artists worldwide. Since 2020, the circle of eligible  artists has broadened and includes not only emerging and mid-career  artists from the Discoveries sector, but also artists represented by  galleries founded no more than ten years ago at Art Basel’s show in  Hong Kong. In recognition of the ongoing exceptional circumstances  caused by the pandemic, the international expert jury conducted its  selection process online. The selected artists were then invited to  submit proposals for a journey aimed to further develop their artistic  work. Based on these proposals the winner was selected. Julien Creuzet  plans to start his BMW Art Journey in summer 2021.Past winners of the BMW Art Journey include sound and performance  artist Samson Young (presented by a.m. Space, Hong  Kong at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2015); video artists    Henning Fehr and Philipp Rühr (presented by Galerie  Max Mayer, Dusseldorf at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2015);"    Abigail Reynolds (presented by Rokeby, London at  Art Basel's show in Hong Kong in 2016) as well as Max Hooper  Schneider (presented by High Art, Paris at Art Basel's Miami  Beach show in 2016), Astha Butail (represented by  GALLERYSKE, New Dehli, Bangalore at Art Basel´s Hong Kong show in  2017), Jamal Cyrus (represented by Inman Gallery,  Houston at Art Basel’s Miami Beach show in 2017), Zac  Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland at Art  Basel’s Hong Kong show in 2018), Lu Yang (represented  by the gallery Société, Berlin at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2019)  and Leelee Chan (represented by Capsule Shanghai at  Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2021).BMW has supported Art Basel’s shows in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong  Kong for many years.For further information about the artists and their projects, please  visit: www.bmw-art-journey.com For further questions please contact:Prof. Dr  Thomas Girst BMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Head of Cultural Engagement Telephone: +49 89 382    24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comwww.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.deSarah DegenArt BaselSenior Media Relations  ManagerTelephone: +41 58 206 2706Email: press@artbasel.com""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Live from BMW Welt: The Esports industry assembles virtually at BMW Esports Boost – Premiere for “The Rival Rig” from RIVALWORKS.;BMW Welt was the epicentre of the Esports industry on Monday, as it hosted the first BMW Esports Boost. ;Munich. BMW Welt was the epicentre of the Esports industry on    Monday, as it hosted the first BMW Esports Boost. In a series of    talks and panel discussions, the many participants from around the    world were given exclusive insights into the world of Esports. Some    of the industry’s most important protagonists – from industry    experts and publishers to the CEOs of prestigious Esports    organisations – also looked at some of the most exciting future    trends. Highlights included the world premiere of “The Rival Rig”.    This visionary Esports hardware is the first product from the    RIVALWORKS virtual technology factory. “Today, the eyes of the Esports community were on BMW Welt and our  Esports Boost festival,” said Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand  Experience BMW. “A big thank you goes to all our speakers, who  provided a vast array of insights and inspirations in their talks and  panel discussions – and, of course, to our cooperation partner  Seven.One Sports. With the BMW Esports Boost, we are entering another  level of our involvement in Esports: RIVALWORKS. This sees BMW immerse  itself in the virtual world, with totally new target groups. With ‘The  Rival Rig’, we have launched the first product from our virtual  technology factory. For us, this represents the logical link between  reality as a tech company and totally new digital experiences. BMW  Group Designworks has turned a bold vision into reality in an  impressive manner. BMW Esports Boost, RIVALWORKS and ‘The Rival Rig’:  Today has shown once again what a strong catalyst BMW is for Esports.” RIVALWORKS made its first appearance in the fictitious Manga series  “Heroes of Rivalry”, with which BMW, together with its partner teams,  offered Esports fans a totally new storytelling format in recent  months. RIVALWORKS was portrayed as a technology factory, in which BMW  engineers researched ideas and hardware components. The goal is always  to use innovative technology to promote competition between players  and teams in Esports, and to take this to a new level. This has now  produced its first (real) product: “The Rival Rig”. In the real world, BMW engineers developed the ground-breaking  concept for this multifunctional gaming hardware, supported by the BMW  Group’s innovation studio Designworks. The focus was on “Gaming  Performance”, “Players’ Health” and “Open Source”. As a result, “The  Rival Rig” offers many unique features to support players’  performance, whilst at the same time integrating health aspects. “The  Rival Rig” is also designed as an open platform, which, in the future,  will incorporate ideas and stimulus from the community, as well as  from gaming platforms and third-party hardware and software providers.  The many stand-out features of “The Rival Rig” include the  “Microclimate Control System” and “Adaptive Seating”. AI-controlled  interaction between integrated sensors, pneumatic air pads and  electro-mechanical actuators ensure that the whole platform is  perfectly geared towards the players. As well as the presentation of “The Rival Rig”, a host of top  international speakers at the BMW Esports Boost used fascinating panel  discussions and presentations to provide new ideas and give exclusive  insights into the world of Esports. In his talk, Christopher Hana from  “The Esports Observer” highlighted the characteristics of Esports as  part of the gaming culture. In the panel discussion “Advertising to a  community that hates advertising”, participants learned the golden  rules for advertising in an Esports and gaming environment. Under the  heading “Boost your Esports”, speakers discussed growth trends and the  growing importance of mobile Esports, virtual influencers and virtual  reality in Esports and gaming. Furthermore, the increasing relevance  of mainstream media like esports.com as key growth drivers for Esports  was emphasised. Experts identified the shooter “Valorant” from Riot  Games as the title with the biggest growth potential, as confirmed by  the involvement of BMW. Three questions for … Holger Hampf, President of Designworks. Mr. Hampf, Designworks meets RIVALWORKS: How did you and your    team approach the challenge? Holger Hampf: “The Rival Rig by BMW and RIVALWORKS, more than any  other project before, was about pushing the boundaries of human  capabilities. What we wanted to achieve is a gaming rig design that  takes both technology and aesthetics in this field to the next level.  Our goal was to create the most comfortable seating, hand posture and  head movement situation, that allow the gamer to fully immerse herself  or himself and experience a sense of weightlessness. It’s a once in a  lifetime opportunity for a designer to work on a project like this as  we were able to play to extremes in terms of technology.” What were your sources of inspiration for this extraordinary    excursion into the world of Esports?  Hampf: “We searched for inspiration in fields where humans have to  take decisions in split seconds. Our design was influenced by the  characteristics of spaceships and Formula 1 cars. If you think of  spacecraft design and human spaceflight, you understand that  astronauts have to operate very complex systems, and that they have to  make decisions super quickly, often beyond what we call ‘normal human  capacities’. The same observations we made in Formula 1 where the  physical capabilities of drivers are developed to an extreme level. We  applied our learnings from these fields in a new context, all down to  a microscopic level. This project really was about millimeters rather  than centimeters.” For Esports enthusiasts “The Rival Rig” is the gateway between    the real and virtual world. How is this reflected in the design?  Hampf: “First of all, we developed the gaming rig in very close  collaboration with gamers. Only if you understand the physicality of a  potential user, his or her size, weight, arm length, hand size etc.  you’re able to create a design that allows the gamer to fully immerse  himself or herself into the digital world. Secondly, major design  choices we made for the rig were influenced by the aesthetics you  typically find in games. These visual worlds also influenced the  ambience we wanted to create: The gaming rig can mirror what’s  happening at that very moment in a game through LED lighting effects  that utilize the entire light spectrum – from calming moods to a  brightly lit activity scenes. This means the design of the gaming rig  does not only have the gamer but also the audience in mind. Esports is  a dynamically growing field with an immense public audience, both  online and via live staged events.

Both MOTUL BMW M8 GTEs on the GTLM podium at Watkins Glen – Turner Motorsport wins the GTD class.;Three BMWs made it onto the podium in race three of this season’s Michelin Endurance Cup, which forms part of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. ;Watkins Glen. Three BMWs made it onto the podium in race three    of this season’s Michelin Endurance Cup, which forms part of the    IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. In the GTLM class, John    Edwards (USA), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Augusto Farfus (BRA) finished    second in the #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE at the ‘Six Hours of the Glen’ at    Watkins Glen (USA). They were followed over the finish line by    fellow BMW Team RLL drivers Connor De Phillippi (USA), Bruno    Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT) in third place in the team’s    second car. Turner Motorsport took victory in the GTD class. Bill    Auberlen, Robby Foley (both USA) and Aidan Read (AUS) took victory    in the #96 BMW M6 GT3. With roughly one hour of the race remaining, a yellow phase saw the  whole field group together again, making for an exciting finish. In  the GTLM class, the two MOTUL BMW M8 GTEs were hunting down the  leading Corvettes. Edwards pulled off a brave overtaking manoeuvre to  take second place, which he held to finish runner-up behind the  victorious #3 Corvette. De Phillippi got the upper hand over the  second Corvette shortly before the flag and finished third to join his  team-mates on the podium. Turner Motorsport took victory thanks to a perfectly-timed final pit  stop. The final yellow phase came shortly after Auberlen had taken  over at the wheel. As a result, the #96 BMW M6 GT3 found itself at the  head of the GTD field. Auberlen set about extending his lead, which he  defended comfortably through to the finish. The win sees Auberlen and  Foley maintain their overall lead in the GTD class of the IMSA series. Reactions to the race at Watkins Glen: John Edwards (#24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    2nd place GTLM class): “That was really close in  the end. I gave it everything and managed to overtake one Corvette. I  was also able to put pressure on the other, but it managed to find a  bit more speed when I was right behind it. So second place it is. The  battle was fun, but the result is a little bittersweet. However, to be  honest, at the halfway point of the race I did not think we had any  chance at all against the Corvettes.” Jesse Krohn (#24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    2nd place GTLM class): “A flawless race from the  entire team was rewarded with two podiums. Unfortunately, it was not  quite enough for the win. The Corvette had a little more speed than we  did, so we made the most of what was possible for us. An awesome job  from the team.” Augusto Farfus (#24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    2nd place GTLM class): “We have every reason to  celebrate. Our two podiums and the class win for Turner Motorsport are  fantastic results for BMW M Motorsport. BMW Team RLL did a perfect  job. We leave Watkins Glen with a smile on our face.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    3rd place GTLM class): “Third place for us and  two cars on the podium – that is a good result for BMW M Motorsport,  even if I would obviously have preferred to win. Unfortunately, our  opponents were very quick, but we got the most out of our strategy. I  fought hard for the podium at the end, and basically passed the #4  Corvette on the last lap. These are important points for us in the  overall standings.” Bruno Spengler (#25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    3rd place GTLM class): “I am pleased that the  team was rewarded for its fantastic performance with two podium  finishes. We obviously wanted to win, but we were just lacking a  little pace. We were able to compensate for this disadvantage in the  traffic. In the end, however, I think second and third place were the  best we could have hoped for.” Philipp Eng (#25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    3rd place GTLM class): “The race was hectic but  a lot of fun. It was fantastic to drive alongside Connor and Bruno for  BMW Team RLL and to celebrate two podiums. I can hardly wait to return  for ‘Petit Le Mans’.” Bill Auberlen (#96 BMW M6 GT3, Turner Motorsport,    1st place GTD class):“Today was simply our day. We were actually no longer in our planned  fuelling rhythm after a problem during refuelling. However, the yellow  phase began exactly at the moment in which we had come in for our  final stop. We came out, and all the GTD cars in front of us still had  to come into the pits. That put me in front and I just had to keep it  clean through to the finish. It worked out superbly.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW International Open: Heavenly Hovland, Comeback Kaymer!;Viktor Hovland carded rounds of 68, 67, 64 and 70 (269) to win the 2021 BMW International Open with a final score of -19. This was the Norwegian’s maiden victory on the European Tour at the 17th attempt and sees him climb to 13th place in the world rankings. ; Munich. Viktor Hovland carded rounds of 68, 67, 64 and 70    (269) to win the 2021 BMW International Open with a final score of    -19. This was the Norwegian’s maiden victory on the European Tour at    the 17th attempt and sees him climb to 13th    place in the world rankings. 2008 winner Martin Kaymer (271 shots,    -17), who remains the only German champion and youngest winner in    the history of the tournament, had to settle for second place, just    two shots back. Amateur Matthias Schmid (277, -11) impressed with an    excellent 14th place.“Congratulations to Viktor Hovland on an impressive and deserved  victory at the 32nd BMW International Open, which sees him  make history as the first European Tour winner from Norway,” said Ilka  Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human  Resources, Labour Relations Director. “This tournament has been a  feast of top-class golf, but there was one thing missing. We missed  the many fans lining the fairways and greens, whose enthusiasm usually  creates such a fantastic flair and atmosphere. We are very much  looking forward to experiencing that together with all the visitors  again next year.”After three rounds, in which Hovland produced a display of excellent  golf, as well as an impressive composure and calm, the young  Norwegian’s three-shot lead looked set to make Sunday a formality.  However, he struggled with a cold putter on his final round, despite  continuing to take a very aggressive approach. On several occasions,  Hovland found himself in a tie for the lead. However, strong nerves at  the end of a round that included four birdies and two bogeys helped  him to a historic victory.“I am very happy to be sat here with the trophy. When you lead after  three rounds, you can’t help thinking about what might be. That was  not a good round today, but in the end I decided to play simple golf  and stay true to myself,” said Hovland. “I really enjoyed being back  in Europe. I keep hearing from colleagues what a fantastic tournament  BMW puts on here. That was one of the reasons for coming to Munich. It  was great to experience that for myself. I will definitely be back  next year.”Despite trailing Hovland by eight shots after three rounds, Kaymer  came very close to claiming a second victory at the BMW International  Open on Sunday. An outstanding performance – the two-time major winner  carded ten birdies and just two bogeys – twice brought him into a  share of the lead. In the end, a very satisfied Kaymer had to settle  for second place: “I took a lot from today, particularly the birdie  putt on the 18th. Whether or not it is ultimately enough for the win  does not really matter. I gave myself chances. That is important. It  was a wonderful tournament, and I feel sorry for the whole BMW team,  which has invested a lot of work, that we were not allowed to have  more spectators. I would have liked that.”Schmid was presented with the trophy for the best amateur. Although  the 22-year-old German was the only non-professional in the field, he  more than deserved the recognition following four under-par rounds  that saw him finish tied in 14th place. “It was very tidy  from tee to green, but my short game and putting were nothing special.  I only made a few birdies from promising positions,” he said after his  final round. On the whole, however, he was happy. “It has been a  fantastic week for me against a home backdrop!”23-year-old Norrman made history in the third round, when he hit an  extremely rare hole-in-one on a par 4 hole. Using a 3-wood, he drove  his tee shot straight into the hole on the 247-metre 16th. This was  only the third albatross in the 32-year history of the tournament –  following in the footsteps of José Maria Olazábal (ESP, 2001, hole 11,  par 5) and Rafa Echenique (ARG, 2009, hole 18, par 5) – and the first  on a par 4.Unfortunately, nobody was able to produce the perfect shot on the  17th to win this week’s BMW Hole-in-One Award. Neither the  pros nor amateur Paul Neumann, whose trick shot won the “Steal the  Car” competition on the BMW Golfsport social media channels. Neumann  was rewarded on Tuesday with 50 attempts to hit a hole-in-one that  would have won him the BMW iX, the BMW Group’s new fully-electric flagship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW International Open: Hovland surges ahead on Moving Day – Norrman makes history with the shot of the tournament.;It was a brilliant Saturday at the BMW International Open. Viktor Hovland, one of the top favourites coming into the tournament, lived up to his billing in style and starts Sunday’s final round with a three-shot lead at the top of the leaderboard. Vincent Norrman holed his tee shot on the 16th hole (247.8 metres, par 4) to card only the third albatross in the 32-year tournament history – and the first on a par 4 hole.; Munich. It was a brilliant Saturday at the BMW International    Open. Viktor Hovland, one of the top favourites coming into the    tournament, lived up to his billing in style and starts Sunday’s    final round with a three-shot lead at the top of the leaderboard.    Vincent Norrman holed his tee shot on the 16th hole (247.8 metres,    par 4) to card only the third albatross in the 32-year tournament    history – and the first on a par 4 hole.Hovland, who tomorrow could become the very first Norwegian ever to  win a tournament on the European Tour, carded a bogey-free third round  – despite driving into the water on the fourth hole – and hit eight  birdies as he pulled clear of the field. The 23-year-old holds a  healthy three-shot lead over the man in second place, Jorge Campillo  (-14). The rest of the chasing pack are led by Darren Fichardt (RSA,  -13, 3), and Bernd Wiesberger (AUT) and Niall Kearney (IRL, both -11, T4).“I just try to stay within myself. Obviously, I look at leaderboards  to see where I’m at, but instead of trying to force things, I just  tell myself at the start of the day just to take control of my own  game,” said Hovland, describing the secret to his success. “If I don’t  waste shots here and there, just play smart, trust that I’m doing the  right things, I think I should have a really good shot tomorrow.”Meanwhile, 23-year-old Norrman made tournament history when he hit an  extremely rare hole-in-one on a par 4. Using a 3 wood, he drove his  ball 270 yards into the hole. This was only the third albatross in the  history of the tournament, following in the footsteps of José Maria  Olazábal (ESP, 2001, hole 11, par 5) and Rafa Echenique (ARG, 2009,  hole 18, par 5). “It is incredible. Unfortunately, that shot came one  hole too early,” said the Swede, referring to the BMW iX on offer for  an ace on the 17th hole. “I think BMW should put the  Hole-in-One Award on the 16th hole in the future. The hole  is harder to hit – you deserve a BMW for that.”Kaymer was in touch with the leaders at the start of his round, but a  double-bogey on the 16th, after a poor third shot landed in  the water, cost him a better position. Despite this, the two-time  major winner was still satisfied and said: “It was very solid for 17  holes. I just dropped two or three shots on the rest of the field on  one hole. With a par, I would have been right in the tournament.  However, I am focussing on the big picture. I have played three solid  rounds and given myself a lot of chances. I will need a 7 or 8 under  to be up there challenging tomorrow. That is possible, but you have to  avoid making those odd errors here and there.”The positive surprise of the tournament remains the only amateur in  the field. Matthias Schmid hit another impressive round of 69. The  22-year-old is at one with himself and has a healthy self-confidence.  “I am playing the same game as everyone else, so I believe I can  achieve something tomorrow. I will try to play a good round, then  we’ll see what happens,” said Schmid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Youngest overall winners ever: BMW Junior Team claims its first victory on the Nordschleife with the BMW M6 GT3.;After four extremely exciting hours of racing, a dream came true for the BMW Junior Team, its first overall victory on the Nordschleife with the BMW M6 GT3. Neil Verhagen (USA), Max Hesse (GER) and Dan Harper (GBR) won race four of the 2021 Nürburgring Endurance Series. A brilliant performance saw them prevail against stiff opposition, making them the youngest team in the history of endurances races to win at the Nürburgring (GER).;Nürburg. After four extremely exciting hours of racing, a    dream came true for the BMW Junior Team, its first overall victory    on the Nordschleife with the BMW M6 GT3. Neil Verhagen (USA), Max    Hesse (GER) and Dan Harper (GBR) won race four of the 2021    Nürburgring Endurance Series. A brilliant performance saw them    prevail against stiff opposition, making them the youngest team in    the history of endurances races to win at the Nürburgring (GER). Harper laid the foundation for this success in morning qualifying  when he secured second place on the grid for the #44 BMW M6 GT3.  Verhagen was first behind the wheel in the race, and kept the trio on  course for a podium finish from the opening lap. During Hesse’s stint,  some of the lap times he set were five seconds quicker than his  closest rivals. A drive-through penalty, which the team received two  hours into the race following a collision at the start, initially saw  the team drop back through the field. However, this was to be just a  brief setback. With a good one and a half hours remaining, Harper moved to the head  of the field in the #44 BMW M6 GT3. He then defended his lead superbly  in a thrilling duel with the second-placed Audi. When both cars came  in for their final pit stop at the same time, roughly 40 minutes from  the end of the race, the Audi briefly took the lead. However, it only  took Harper a few corners to retake the lead, as the team cheered on.  After four hours of racing, the #44 BMW M6 GT3 crossed the finish line  in first place. The car was run by BMW Team RMG. “That was a fantastic race,” said mentor Jochen Neerpasch, who was  spellbound as he followed the action in the garage. “In the 24-hour  race the boys showed that they belong in the top class. However, they  graduated in style here today. It was an outstanding performance. It  was not gifted to them, but was a very tough race. The way they  withstood the pressure was impressive. That is by no means a matter of  course at this young age. The BMW Juniors have shown once again how  well they work together as a team.” “I am just super, super happy. This is a dream come true for us all,”  said Hesse. “We worked hard all year and, unfortunately, were not  rewarded with the result our effort deserved. I believe we have now  paid the team back a little. The guys really put their foot down. A  big thank you also goes to Augusto Farfus, without whom we certainly  would not be here now. We are just happy and want to continue this way.” “Max and Dan did an amazing job;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Race debut of the new BMW M4 GT3 on the Nordschleife postponed.;The race debut of the BMW M4 GT3 has had to be postponed. The plan was for the new race car to take part in round four of the 2021 Nürburgring Endurance Series, on Saturday on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), but this has had to be cancelled at short notice.;Nürburg. The race debut of the BMW M4 GT3 has had to be    postponed. The plan was for the new race car to take part in round    four of the 2021 Nürburgring Endurance Series, on Saturday on the    Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), but this has had to be cancelled at    short notice. The car suffered damage in a crash during the closing    stages of the test and set-up session on Friday evening and could    not be repaired overnight. BMW M Motorsport is currently analysing    the cause of the crash in detail. Up to this point, the intense week of testing with the BMW M4 GT3 had  run smoothly. On Monday and Tuesday, BMW M Motorsport had the  opportunity to take part in the official SRO tests ahead of the  24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). After the new car’s first  outing at the Belgian circuit, BMW M Motorsport drew an extremely  positive conclusion in all areas. Augusto Farfus (BRA), Marco Wittmann  (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) alternated behind the wheel at Spa-Francorchamps. From the Ardennes, the BMW M4 GT3 headed straight to the Eifel region  of Germany, where Jens Klingmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)  took over in the cockpit. Friday’s test and set-up drives on the Grand  Prix Circuit and Nürburgring-Nordschleife were also going very well  until the crash, which occurred shortly before the end of the session.  A technical issue resulted in Van der Linde losing control of the car  and crashing into the barriers. “It is a great shame that our test week with the BMW M4 GT3, which  had been very successful up until that point, ended prematurely – and  that we have had to postpone the car’s race debut, to which we were  all very much looking forward,” said Mike Krack, Head of BMW M  Motorsport. “The impact caused damage to the car and so we decided to  withdraw from the NLS race on Saturday. We did not take this decision  lightly. However, our priority now is to find out exactly what caused  the crash. It is not uncommon to have a technical issue in the  development phase of a new car. That is precisely what these intensive  tests are for: to identify potential weaknesses during the development  phase, and to eliminate these for the future. That is what we will do now.” Generally speaking, the BMW M4 GT3, the new flagship in the BMW M  Motorsport range, once again impressed in terms of driveability and  handling at Spa-Francorchamps and on the Nordschleife. “Friday was our  second outing with the BMW M4 GT3 on the Nordschleife, and I felt very  comfortable in the car from the first lap,” said Klingmann. “It  definitely confirmed the positive impression I got last time, and the  further development since then has certainly made the car even better.  Clear progress has been made with the BMW M4 GT3 in the sections, in  which the BMW M6 GT3 was weaker. At the same time, it has retained the  strengths of the M6. I am feeling very positive: the car feels good  and gives you a lot of confidence from the first lap.” Yelloly, who set the fastest time with the BMW M4 GT3 during the test  at Spa-Francorchamps, agreed: “We did a lot of driving in the rain on  day one, while the second day was dry. That gave us the opportunity to  complete a lot of laps with the BMW M4 GT3 in all conditions. The car  felt fantastic, ran like clockwork, and the balance is outstanding. We  completed a lot of test work in a wide range of areas at  Spa-Francorchamps. The fact that we set the fastest time was obviously  a nice bonus.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW International Open: Top stars move into position.;Viktor Hovland’s display at the BMW International Open today showed emphatically why he has been tipped for a glittering career. Norway’s popular rising star, the current number 14 in the world rankings, climbed into a share for second place, courtesy of a round that included eight birdies and three bogeys. Two-time major winner Martin Kaymer also worked his way up the leaderboard and is still very much in contention.; Munich. Viktor Hovland’s display at the BMW International Open    today showed emphatically why he has been tipped for a glittering    career. Norway’s popular rising star, the current number 14 in the    world rankings, climbed into a share for second place, courtesy of a    round that included eight birdies and three bogeys. Two-time major    winner Martin Kaymer also worked his way up the leaderboard and is    still very much in contention to win the most prestigious golf    tournament in Germany for a second time, having previously triumphed    in 2008. Amateur Matthias Schmid made the cut for the first time at    a European Tour event, after which he said confidently: “You play to win”.After rounds of 68 and 67, Hovland is one of the chasing pack just  two shots behind leader Kearney and is visibly enjoying himself at his  first BMW International Open. “It’s still a little wet out there, but  the course is holding up great. Even playing in the afternoon, the  greens are still great. You can make a lot of putts, which I did  today. I just have to continue playing this way at the weekend.”Kaymer made a dream start to his second round and was five under par  for the day after nine holes. He carded three bogeys on the back nine,  but bounced back each time with a birdie on the following hole. The  36-year-old has his trainer Günter Kessler at his side this week, and  said: “My trainer must have earned me four or five shots this week. I  hit a lot of good tee shots, which had been an issue in recent weeks.  We have done a lot of practice on the driving range. That is why I hit  a lot of fairways and reached the green on some par-four holes in one.”Louis Oosthuizen is another top-class player who has moved into a  promising position ahead of the weekend. The South African, who  narrowly missed out on his second major title at the US Open last  Sunday, carded a round of 67 on Friday. Oosthuizen put his change in  fortunes since yesterday (70) down to the fact that he has recovered  from the jet lag he was suffering.Schmid goes into the weekend tied with the two major winners. The man  from Germany made the cut for the first time on the European Tour and  is looking to go on the offensive at the weekend. “I am in a good  position and not far off the lead. I am looking up the leaderboard at  the weekend. I don’t need to defend 20th place, as I won’t  receive the money anyway. You play to win.”The leader at the halfway point is 33-year-old Niall Kearney (-11),  who took 68 shots today after a brilliant opening round of 65 and is  enjoying the week in Eichenried. “The course is fantastic. It suits my  eye – old fashioned avenues, and it’s quite tight off the tee. I’ve  really enjoyed it.”Despite being tied for second place, Wiesberger was not entirely  satisfied: “Today’s score is okay.  Little spells of giving away shots  today at the end and in the middle of the round yesterday, which I  felt was unnecessary. I was kind of in control, but I didn’t feel like  I was firing on all cylinders.”As well as Kaymer and Schmid, fellow Germans Nicolai von  Dellingshausen, Marcel Schneider, Philipp Mejow and Freddy Schott,  (all -2, T57) also made the cut.Defending champion Andrea Pavan (ITA) was disqualified after he  signed for an incorrect scorecard. European Ryder Cup captain Pádraig  Harrington (IRL) will no longer be playing at the weekend. He and  Germans Stephan Jäger, Alex Cejka, Max Kieffer – on his  31st birthday –, Bernd Ritthammer, Benedict Staben, Max  Schmitt and Thomas Rosenmüller all failed to make the cut. Sebastian  Heisele (GER) retired with an injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
As realistic as it gets: iRacing and BMW works driver Bruno Spengler advance the BMW M4 GT3.;Sim racers have been able to contest races with the development model of the new BMW M4 GT3 on iRacing since the start of the year. Now, the simulation platform has released an upgrade of the car with the latest BMW M Motorsport design. ;Munich. Sim racers have been able to contest races with the    development model of the new BMW M4 GT3 on iRacing since the start    of the year. Now, the simulation platform has released an upgrade of    the car with the latest BMW M Motorsport design. This version of the    BMW M4 GT3 comes very close to the handling of the real car which is    set to make its race debut next Saturday. This is the result of very    close, intensive collaboration between BMW works driver Bruno    Spengler (CAN) and the iRacing developers during the further    development in recent months. About six months after the virtual BMW M4 GT3 made its debut on  iRacing the upgrade of the car is due to be launched. This was worked  on by Spengler in collaboration with Chris Lerch (USA), the head  Vehicle Dynamics Engineer for the simulation platform, and an internal  iRacing test driver. The team focussed primarily on working on the  driving physics, chassis and optimisations in selected aerodynamic  areas. “The aim was to make the handling as similar to that of the  real car as possible,” explained Spengler. The BMW works driver was the perfect point of contact for this as he  has already tested the real-world BMW M4 GT3 himself and is also an  experienced sim racer who has already brought home countless wins and  titles on iRacing. “Bruno’s input was invaluable to this project,“  said Lerch. “His test drives and his feedback advanced the development  from start to finish. We are extremely grateful to him for his input.” The basis for the further development of the virtual BMW M4 GT3 in  recent months was first and foremost Spengler’s subjective driving  experience. The iRacing developers used the comprehensive vehicle data  that they received from BMW M Motorsport last year to convert  Spengler’s very detailed feedback into actual numbers for the upgrade.  That is how the team went from one version of the BMW M4 GT3 to the  next, until it was as realistic as possible from Spengler’s  perspective. The iRacing test driver was tasked with collecting his  impressions, which help classify the car correctly in the balance of  performance that is crucial for GT3 races. And Lerch contributed the  perspective of a hobby sim racer, as the aim is for the BMW M4 GT3 to  be very drivable for that level as well. “It was a cool challenge bringing sim racing and real-world racing  together like this,” summed up Spengler. “The collaboration with  iRacing was fantastic and was a lot of fun. From my perspective, the  virtual BMW M4 GT3 is now very like the real thing. I’m excited to  hear what the sim racers have to say.” The real-world BMW M4 GT3 is set to make its race debut in the new  BMW M Motorsport design next Saturday, in the Nürburgring Endurance  Series. The same design is now available to all sim racers on iRacing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Leading the way: Wade Ormsby (AUS), Sam Horsfield (ENG),    Masahiro Kawamura (JPN) and Sebastian García Rodriguez (ESP), who    lead Germany’s iconic tournament after the opening day.Ormsby, whose only victory on the European Tour came at the 2018 Hong  Kong Open, did not drop a shot on the opening round as he moved to the  top of the leaderboard at midday on Thursday. He was later joined  there by afternoon starters Horsfield, Kawamura and García Rodriguez.  One of the most popular players on the Tour, Andrew “Beef” Johnson,  also remained bogey-free. He and Pablo Larrazábal, who won in Munich  in 2011 and 2015, are among the chasing pack on 6 under.Martin Kaymer is another man who knows how it feels to lift the  coveted trophy at the BMW International Open, having won in a play-off  in Eichenried in 2008. The two-time major winner carded a solid  opening round, with four birdies and two bogeys. However, Kaymer feels  there is still room for improvement, particularly on the greens. “I  had a lot of chances today, but struggled to get the ball in the hole.  I felt like I was reading the greens well, but had problems with the  pace. Generally speaking, I am happy and I know what I need to work on.”A large group of players on 4 under includes Mattias Schmid, the only  amateur in the field, and one of the most exciting young pros in the  world, Norway’s Viktor Hovland. 22-year-old Schmid, who teed off at  the US Open last week and will turn pro after the British Open, played  a bogey-free round, after which he said: “I played nicely,  particularly off the tee, and hit a lot of greens. Unfortunately, I  missed the odd putt here and there. However, I am satisfied. It was a  solid performance.”Hovland returned to the clubhouse with a more colourful scorecard,  which featured an eagle but also two bogeys. “On the whole, it was  good, but a hit a few poor shots – unfortunately, on the par 5 and the  short par 4, where I found the water. There are a lot of birdie  opportunities on this course, but I have to stop hitting it in the water.”Bernd Wiesberger (AUT, -5) ended the round in tenth place, setting  himself up nicely for the next three days. Major winners Louis  Oosthuizen (RSA, -2, T49) and Pádraig Harrington (Even Par, T82) are  also still in it with three rounds still to play.Alex Cejka (GER, -2), who recently won two majors on the US Champions  Tour, lies tied with Kaymer in 49th place, while local  favourite Stephan Jäger (GER, +3) endured a disappointing start to his  home tournament, with six bogeys and just three birdies. He is tied  for 139th place in a group that includes Max Kieffer (GER)  and defending champion Andrea Pavan (ITA). Sergio García (ESP, +1,  T104) also has work to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

From the Rambla to the race track: with the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman on Mallorca.;Tourism is picking up again on the largest island of the Balearic Islands. The possibilities for active leisure activities are as varied as the landscape and beach life. They make the Spanish holiday paradise a popular destination not only for cyclists, tennis players and sailors, but also for motor sports enthusiasts.;"Munich. Almost 14 million tourists were counted on  the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca in 2019. Due to the  recent travel restrictions, the rush of visitors was slowed down  considerably in the meantime, but now the holidaymakers are returning.  There is no shortage of reasons for this. Some long for relaxation on  the beach or in luxurious hotel complexes, for some the party  atmosphere at Playa de Palma is the focus of interest, and still  others swear by ""the other Mallorca"". Lonely bays, unspoilt  landscapes and small, unspoilt villages away from the tourist  strongholds can be found in almost all regions of Mallorca, as a round  trip of the island in the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman (fuel  consumption combined: 7.9 - 7.4 l/100 km according to WLTP, 7.0 - 6.6  l/100 km according to NEDC";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Team RLL looking to maintain podium streak at Watkins Glen.;BMW Team RLL is ready for the third endurance race of the 2021 season, the Six Hours of the Glen at Watkins Glen (USA) this coming Sunday, 27th June. As they look to defend the 2020 GTLM class Michelin Endurance Cup title, the team has already scored three podium results with its MOTUL BMW M8 GTEs in the first two races of the year.;Munich. BMW Team RLL is ready for the third endurance race of the    2021 season, the Six Hours of the Glen at Watkins Glen (USA) this    coming Sunday, 27th June. As they look to defend the 2020 GTLM class    Michelin Endurance Cup title, the team has already scored three    podium results with its MOTUL BMW M8 GTEs in the first two races of    the year. A third-place finish at the Rolex 24 At Daytona (USA) to    start the season was followed by a double-podium (second and third    places) at the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA) in March. BMW Team RLL now    aims to continue this podium streak, in the final season of    competition of the BMW M8 GTE, at Watkins Glen. The #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE will be driven by John Edwards (USA), Jesse  Krohn (FIN) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). Their team-mates Connor De  Phillippi (USA), Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT) will share  duties in the #25 car. Earlier this month, the team completed two  successful days of testing at Watkins Glen in preparation for the race. In the GTD class, the Turner Motorsport team will enter the #96 BMW  M6 GT3 with Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley (both USA) and Aidan Read (AUS)  at the wheel. The Six Hours of the Glen will take the green flag at  10:40 a.m. local time (16:40 CEST) on Sunday, 27th June. Quotes ahead of the Six Hours of the Glen: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “Based on  the results of the test at the Glen we can be very encouraged. We have  had some good qualifying results in recent years, but podium finishes  have eluded us. There is nothing easy about Watkins Glen. It demands a  great deal from a driver, but that is what makes it a track that is  always looked forward to.”   John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “Watkins Glen is definitely my favorite track in the  U.S. and after we didn’t get to race here last year, I’ve been itching  to get back! The elevation changes and high average speeds have always  made this a special place, but since the track got repaved a few years  ago, it added even more grip to an already fast circuit. After a  couple podiums to start out our season, I would love to get our first  win of 2021 at this awesome track to keep us in the fight in our title  defense of the Michelin Endurance Cup.” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “I  have always enjoyed racing at Watkins Glen. BMW Team RLL has always  proven competitive there and this year we are looking very strong.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “This will be my first-time racing at Watkins Glen. On  paper and in the simulator it looks challenging and looks to be a  track I will enjoy. We have two podiums from two races so far this  season so let’s keep up the good work.” Bruno Spengler (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE):  “Our test this month was my first time at Watkins Glen, and I  thoroughly enjoyed the track. Last year, the six-hour race was moved  to Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta because of Covid-19 and Connor and I  won that race. It looks to me that traffic management will be one of  the keys to success this weekend.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “After two years away from Watkins Glen, it is great to  finally be back to one of my favorite racetracks. The BMW M8 GTE has  always performed very well there, and I’m confident we can give our M8  an excellent final showing at this historic track. The #25 car boys  are ready for a win after being so close in the previous event!” Philipp Eng (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “I  am very much looking forward to my first laps around the great circuit  of Watkins Glen. We had a good run in Sebring finishing second. I  really enjoy my racing in IMSA together with BMW Team RLL and I really  hope that we are scoring another strong result at the Glen!” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW M Motorsport Newsletter, 21st June 2021;BMW M Motorsport teams are once again in action all over the world in 2021. They are challenging for race wins and titles with the BMW M6 GT3, the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW M2 CS Racing, and other BMW M Motorsport race cars. Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you an overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams.;DTM: Top-five finishes for the BMW M6 GT3 at Monza season-opener. The Royal Park in Monza (ITA) hosted last weekend’s opening round of  the new GT3 DTM. Among those lining up in the realigned championship  were the Walkenhorst Motorsport and ROWE Racing teams with their BMW  M6 GT3. Saturday was a tough day, with only Marco Wittmann (GER)  making it into the top ten in ninth place in the #11 Walkenhorst  Motorsport car. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Timo Glock (GER), both  driving for ROWE Racing, finished 12th and 17th. The tide turned for the BMW teams on Sunday, as the BMW M6 GT3 picked  up two top-five finishes. Van der Linde had impressed in the #31 car  in qualifying, securing third place on the grid. In the race itself,  the South African made a spectacular overtaking manoeuvre to pass both  Nico Müller (SUI / Audi) and Liam Lawson (NZL / Ferrari) in one go.  After the round of pit stops, van der Linde found himself in fourth  place, a position he maintained through to the finish. Wittmann made  an impressive comeback from eleventh place on the grid and crossed the  finish line just behind van der Linde in fifth place. Glock was forced  to retire as a consequence of a collision in the jostling for position  on lap one. Round two of the 2021 DTM season takes place from 23rd to  25th July at the Lausitzring (GER). --DTM Trophy: Magnificent season-opener for the BMW M4 GT4 at Monza. The DTM Trophy also kicked off the 2021 season at Monza (ITA) at the  weekend – and victory in the first two races of the year went to BMW M  Motorsport teams and the BMW M4 GT4. The season started with a bang in  race one on Saturday, with eight BMW M4 GT4s in the first nine places.  It was Ben Green (GBR) from the FK Performance Motorsport team who led  from start to finish to convert pole position into victory. He was  joined on the podium by his team-mate Moritz Löhner (GER) who comes  from an Esports background and finished third in his first ever car  race. Positions four to nine also went to BMW M Motorsport teams. In race two on Sunday, Michael Schrey (GER) from the Hofor Racing by  Bonk Motorsport team claimed his maiden victory in the DTM Trophy. He  led the race in his BMW M4 GT4 for a long time, before eventually  crossing the finish line in second place. However, the driver ahead of  him was subsequently handed a time penalty for gaining an advantage by  leaving the track in a chicane. That saw Schrey promoted to first  place. Victory on Sunday and fourth place on Saturday put Schrey  second in the championship at the end of the opening weekend, followed  by Green and Löhner in third and fourth. --ADAC GT Masters: Podium for Schubert Motorsport at the Red    Bull Ring. The ADAC GT Masters held its second event of the season at the Red  Bull Ring in Spielberg (AUT) from 11th to 13th  June. As at the opening round at Oschersleben (GER) in May, Schubert  Motorsport featured on the podium. Nick Yelloly (GBR) and Jesse Krohn  (FIN) were third in the #10 BMW M6 GT3 in Sunday’s race. The duo  failed to finish race one on the Saturday. --ADAC GT4 Germany: Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport dominates in Spielberg. One week before his maiden DTM Trophy win, Michael Schrey (GER) and  the Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport team dominated proceedings in ADAC  GT4 Germany. Schrey and team-mate Gabriele Piana (ITA) were unbeatable  again in the #2 BMW M4 GT4 at round two of the season, which took  place from 11th to 13th June at the Red Bull  Ring in Spielberg (AUT). They had previously won both races at the  season-opener in May at Oschersleben (GER) – and they repeated that  double success in Austria. With four wins from four races,  Schrey/Piana and Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport hold big leads in  both the Driver and Team competitions after two events. The Schubert Motorsport team finished in the top eight in both races  at the Red Bull Ring. Michael von Zabiensky and Marcel Lenerz (both  GER) were fifth and eighth in the #10 BMW M4 GT4. --GT4 European Series: Round three of the season at Zandvoort. The GT4 European Series was in the dunes of Zandvoort (NED) last  weekend for its third event of the season. Cem Bölükbasi and Berkay  Besler (both TUR) finished fifth and sixth in the Pro-Am class in the  #12 BMW M4 GT4 of Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport. --GT4 Scandinavia: Lestrup Racing wins with the BMW M4 GT4 at    the season-opener. GT4 Scandinavia kicked off the 2021 season at Fällfors, Sweden, last  weekend. Victory in the first race of the year went to the BMW M4 GT4.  Joakim Walde and Victor Bouveng (both SWE) won the Pro-Am class in the  #98 Lestrup Racing BMW M4 GT4. The duo then finished third in race two. --BTCC: Turkington wins at Snetterton. It was a strong performance from Colin Turkington (GBR) at round two  of the 2021 British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) in Snetterton  (GBR). In the three races on 13th June, he claimed one  victory and a podium in the #2 BMW 330i M Sport. Turkington won race  one and, despite carrying the maximum success weight, finished  runner-up in race two. He then came home third in race three. BMW tops  the Manufacturer standings with 180 points and a lead of ten points  after two rounds. --ESET Cup: Two podiums for the BMW M6 GT3 at Poznan. The Trevor Racing team and the #24 BMW M6 GT3 claimed two podium  finishes in the ESET Cup at Poznan, Poland  (12th/13th June). Gregor Zsigo (SVK) was third  in the GT race. Together with his team-mate Dennis Waszek (CZE), he  then finished runner-up in the Endurance Race. Trevor Racing was also  successful with the #40 BMW M4 GT4. Ferenc Ficza (HUN) ended the  Endurance Race in fourth place overall to take victory in the D4 GT4 class. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Both BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers finish in the points at Sunday’s race in Mexico.;BMW i Andretti Motorsport has rounded off the race weekend in Puebla (MEX) by getting both BMW iFE.21s into the points for the first time this season.;Puebla. BMW i Andretti Motorsport has rounded off the race    weekend in Puebla (MEX) by getting both BMW iFE.21s into the points    for the first time this season. Jake Dennis (GBR) finished fifth in    the ninth race of the season in the ABB FIA Formula E World    Championship to repeat his result from the previous day. Maximilian    Günther (GER) finished seventh and also scored important points for    the overall standings. Dennis also chalked up another point for    being the fastest driver in qualifying. Dennis dominated qualifying, recording the best time by some margin,  but then had problems with tyre grip in Super Pole and began the race  from fifth on the grid. This time, Günther could not find the ideal  lap and finished eleventh, missing out on the Super Pole that he had  already reached five times this season. Both drivers improved swiftly during the race, however, consolidating  their positions in the top ten with some consistent lap times. In the  end, Dennis received 11 points for finishing fifth and recording the  best time in qualifying, while Günther scored six points in seventh  place. The two drivers are now in eighth and 18th positions in the  drivers’ standings. In the team championship, BMW i Andretti  Motorsport is now in sixth place with 82 points. Reactions to Race 9 in Puebla. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 7th place):“I think this was a really strong finish to our weekend here in  Mexico. We had again Jake Dennis in Super Pole with fastest overall in  the groups’ qualifying and I think we were all a bit disappointed with  fifth on the grid but if you make it to Super Pole it’s much easier to  race from there. Then in the race, after the initial melee at the  start sort of settled down it was a smart race from Jake. Behind him,  Maximilian Günther starting back in eleventh, worked his way forward.  It was really good aggressive driving from Maximilian but he kept his  energy consumption under control, a good improvement from yesterday.  He was just the wingman to Jake today and when it was necessary he put  Lynn under pressure right at the end and really made him look in his  mirrors rather than trying to attack Jake too hard. First double  points finish for the team of the season, we are super pleased. That  is very valuable for the championship.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 5th    place, race result: 5th place, points: 54, driver    standings: 8th place):“Mexico race two done – I should be pretty happy. It was quite a  technical race with the energy but I think we did the best job  possible. We got a bit unlucky when Edoardo Mortara got to attack mode  and then he ended up catching me at the wrong point so we dropped back  down to fifth. But overall had a quite a clean race and I think we did  the optimum. So I am happy. The team has done a great job all weekend  and we had two guys scoring points today which is super important for  the championship.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    11th place, race result: 7th place, points:    28, driver standings: 18th place):“A great result for the team. We can be really pleased with fifth and  seventh positions. Starting from eleventh on the grid made my race  anything but easy with all the hustle and bustle. I moved up a few  places at the start. We then managed the race intelligently and did  not lose our cool when we dropped back a place or two. We were then  able to make good use of Attack Mode and had the pace required.  Compared to yesterday, we made really good progress today.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

BMW i Andretti Motorsport produces good pace on Saturday in Puebla – Jake Dennis finishes in fifth place.;BMW i Andretti Motorsport produced good pace to start the second half of the season in the eighth race of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship, but was not rewarded with a podium finish. Jake Dennis (GBR) finished fifth in the #27 BMW iFE.21 to score ten points in the overall standings.;Puebla. BMW i Andretti Motorsport produced good pace to start    the second half of the season in the eighth race of the ABB FIA    Formula E Championship, but was not rewarded with a podium finish.    Jake Dennis (GBR) finished fifth in the #27 BMW iFE.21 to score ten    points in the overall standings. Like Dennis, Maximilian Günther    (GER) was in the top three for some time, even leading the race for    a while. However, he struggled with energy problems in the final    laps and crossed the finish line in twelfth position. For the first time this season, both BMW i Andretti Motorsport  drivers made it to Super Pole in qualifying. Dennis and Günther  secured third and fifth places on the grid. After a great start,  Günther moved into second position right ahead of Dennis and when  leading driver Pascal Wehrlein (GER, Porsche) pulled into the Attack  Zone, the two BMW iFE.21s were at the head of the field for a short time. Both drivers remained in with a good chance of a podium until a few  laps before the end, only to lose ground. Dennis struggled after the  field moved closer together during the second safety car period and  had to activate Attack Mode one more time which cost him a few places.  After 28 laps, he crossed the line in fifth position, while Günther  struggled with energy problems and finished in twelfth place after  outbraking himself on the final lap. Dennis and Günther are tenth and  17th in the drivers’ standings, and BMW i Andretti Motorsport is in  sixth place in the team championship, with 65 points. Race nine of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E World Championship takes  place on Sunday in Puebla. Reactions to Race 8 in Puebla. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“The day started off pretty well. Out of the box I think both cars,  in particular Jake, were very competitive. We had a really good result  in qualifying having both BMW cars in Super Pole for the first time  since Sanya in Season 5. When the lights went green an excellent start  from Maximilian saw him in second place after turn one. Things were  looking very promising. There were a couple of safety car incidents,  one of which worked well for us and the second one unfortunately came  at the wrong time for Jake and really compromised his second Attack  Mode use. The field was packed up at that point and when he rejoined  after taking the attack loop he sort of shuffled in the lower half of  the top-ten. He was able to pick up a couple of spots and was able to  finish in fifth place. We were looking like we are going to get our  first double points score this season right up until the last lap but  Maximilian at the time was somehow compromised with energy and he  tried to defend. He locked up his front tyres and went straight on at  a corner and then unfortunately when he came back onto the race track,  it shuffled him back down into twelfth spot. There’s a lot of data to  review overnight and we’ve got some ideas already on what we can do  differently for tomorrow to hopefully see a stronger finish from both  drivers in the second race here in Mexico.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 3rd    place, race result: 5th place, points: 43, driver    standings: 10th place):“We just got unfortunate with the safety car. We were one of only  cars that hadn’t taken Attack Mode.

As part of the development work, the BMW M4 GT3 will attend the official tests ahead of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. The ‘Official Test Days’ take place at the circuit in the Ardennes on 22nd and 23rd June. Just a few days later, the new BMW M4 GT3 will complete its first test under race conditions on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife.;Munich. The new flagship in the BMW M Motorsport programme is    set for its premiere on the famous ‘Eau Rouge’. As part of the    development work, the BMW M4 GT3 will attend the official tests    ahead of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). The ‘Official Test    Days’ take place at the circuit in the Ardennes on 22nd and 23rd    June. Just a few days later, the new BMW M4 GT3 will complete its    first test under race conditions on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER). The tests ahead of the 24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps provide BMW  M Motorsport with the ideal opportunity to test the BMW M4 GT3 at  another demanding racetrack under real competitive conditions. The  circuit is known as the ‘Ardennes Rollercoaster’ and is a fast,  flowing track. Sharing the test work in Belgium will be Augusto Farfus  (BRA), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR).“It is fantastic to have been given the opportunity to take part in  the tests at Spa-Francorchamps with our new BMW M4 GT3,” said Mike  Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport. “Like the Nordschleife, this circuit  has its own particular features, making it an optimal and very  demanding test facility for us in the final stage of development of  our car. The days at Spa will also be used to prepare for the race  debut of the BMW M4 GT3, which we are all excited about. This test,  under race conditions on the Nordschleife, is the next big step on the  way to our first season in 2022.” The 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps has an important place in BMW’s  motorsport history. With 24 triumphs to its name, the manufacturer is  the record winner of the Belgian marathon. The BMW M4 GT3 will compete  from 2022 and will be looking to continue this success. However, it  must first watch and see how the BMW M6 GT3 gets on in its farewell  performance at Spa at this year’s edition of the endurance classic,  which takes place on 31st July and 1st August. The BMW M4 GT3 will make its race debut at round four of the  Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS), on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife on  26th June, immediately after the tests in Belgium. At the wheel of the  race car will be Jens Klingmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA).  The BMW M4 GT3 will compete in the prototype class SP-X as the new car  is not homologated yet. As this is a test in race mode, the BMW M4 GT3  will not be classified in the Nordschleife results. The outing will be  used to gain valuable experience under race conditions with the new car.  Note to editors: The BMW M4 GT3 will be displayed in the paddock during the fourth NLS  race. Accredited media representatives are invited to check out the  new race car. If interested, please contact Andrea Schwab on +49 151  601 60988.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The BMW Group at the Greentech Festival.;MINI and Designworks: architects of change.;Munich. On 16 – 18 June 2021, the renowned Greentech  Festival in Berlin will bring together companies and organisations who  put a sustainable future at the heart of what they do. The BMW Group  is a cooperation partner of the festival and will also be present at  the Exhibition and contribute to the Conference. Bernd Körber, Head of  MINI, and Holger Hampf, President of Designworks, will be sparking  ideas as keynote speakers and exploring how they see their roles in  shaping a better future. Sustainability is a guiding principle at the BMW Group.“The visionary, sustainable and future-focused platform provided by  Greentech fits perfectly with the BMW Group’s mission to be a constant  driver of change,” explains Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand  Experience. “We are keen to use our involvement at this year’s  Greentech Festival to highlight the BMW Group’s ability to innovate  and showcase its performance potential beyond the classical automotive  themes. Sustainability and the potential of the circular economy for  the environment and climate protection play a very important role in  the activation of our platforms. As part of its “RE:THINK, RE:DUCE,  RE:USE, RE:CYCLE” approach, the BMW Group will use the IAA MOBILITY  2021 show in September to provide an all-encompassing outlook of how  the use of primary raw materials for the car of the future can be  drastically reduced,” adds Ponikva.The position of the BMW Group is clear: the principle of  sustainability is firmly established across every aspect of the  company. Environmental and societal sustainability, responsibility for  its products and a clear commitment to conserving resources stand at  the core of our company strategy. This not only looks at the emissions  generated by its vehicles, for example, it covers the entire value  chain – the full supply chain, production processes, use phase and recycling. MINI leads the way on sustainable, individual mobility in    urban areas.MINI has always been a creative brand focused on urban mobility. At  MINI, global challenges such as climate change and urbanisation are  viewed as opportunities in which to drive forward innovations which  not only improve the customer experience but also have a positive  societal and environmental impact. For this reason, MINI makes  sustainability an unwavering, integral part of its business model. A  prime example of how this could shape the urban mobility of tomorrow  is the MINI Vision Urbanaut, which brings tangible form to the future  vision of the MINI brand and of sustainable mobility. “The character  of the MINI Vision Urbanaut is shaped by a new awareness of  sustainability. The interior uses natural and recycled materials,  which create a very agreeable feeling of space. And that’s important,  as ultimately the MINI Vision Urbanaut is not just a vehicle, but also  a living space,” explains Bernd Körber. Designworks points the way to the future. Using design to meet the challenges of the future is what  Designworks, the BMW Group’s creative consultancy, is all about. As  “architects of the future”, Designworks develops future-focused  concepts for a wide range of sectors and customers around the world  from its three locations in California, Shanghai and Munich. Holger  Hampf, President of Designworks, explains the underlying necessities:  “We are at a turning point on the path to collective well-being. No  individual, company and or government can tackle global challenges  such as climate change, health or conservation of resources on their  own. We have to do it together – and that requires strong  partnerships. Design plays a significant role here, because it can  develop visions and use visualisations to bring tangible form to the  resulting potential. In times of change, in particular, the positive  energy and consultancy expertise of design companies can help to turn  uncertainty into excitement, point the way ahead, set out strategic  approaches and initiate changes in societal behaviour.” BMW Group at the Exhibition.One example of the innovative power of design can be found in the  electrified wingsuit created by BMW i and Designworks in collaboration  with base jumper and extreme sportsman Peter Salzmann. At the  Greentech Festival, the BMW Group will be presenting the first  electric drive system for a wingsuit which can transport the age-old  dream of flying into reality in a totally new way. An interactive  virtual-reality experience allows visitors to the Greentech Festival  to (almost) fly like Peter Salzmann with the electrified wingsuit.Another highlight at the BMW exhibition area is the latest BMW model  from its electric product range: the BMW i4 eDrive40 Gran Coupé – the  first purely electrically powered BMW coupé. Added to which, the BMW  Group is presenting the BMW i3 Urban Suite, a mobility experience  tailored entirely to the passenger’s individual requirements. Here, a  standard BMW i3 was nearly completely redesigned (only the driver’s  seat and dashboard were retained) to create an interior that brings to  mind the relaxed ambience of a boutique hotel. Several of these  vehicles will be in active service as VIP shuttles at the Greentech Festival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Group creates closed-loop material cycle for tungsten production tools to protect valuable resources; Recycling tools at plants in Germany and Austria saves seven tonnes of tungsten per year  Lowers energy consumption by 70% and CO2 emissions by more than 60% compared to primary tungsten  Wendt: “We will significantly increase the percentage of recycled raw materials by 2030 and use raw materials multiple times in a circular economy” ;Munich. The BMW Group is making raw materials  considered to be so-called conflict minerals a special focus of its  sustainability strategy. This includes ores where mining or trading is  often associated with violations of environmental and social  standards. Tungsten is an example of this: Once considered an  irritating by-product of tin mining, since it “ate up” the tin ore, it  took a few hundred years for carbide’s unique properties to be  recognised: heavy like gold, hard as a diamond and dozens of times  more heat-resistant than iron. Today, it can be found in the vibration  alarm of mobile phones and light bulb filaments, as well as drill and  milling bits for industrial machinery used in producing cars.The BMW Group has now created a closed-loop material cycle for this  unique metal and is collecting old drill and milling bits at its  plants in Germany and Austria for recycling. The secondary tungsten  obtained in this way will then be used to manufacture new milling and  drilling tools. This reduces the amount of tungsten required by seven  tonnes per year. Compared to using primary tungsten, this also reduces  energy consumption by 70% and CO2 emissions by more than 60%.“Responsible management of natural resources plays a key role in our  sustainability goals. We plan to increase the percentage of recycled  raw materials significantly by 2030 and use raw materials multiple  times in a circular economy. This applies not only to their use in the  vehicle, but also in value creation overall,” said Dr Andreas Wendt,  member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing  and Supplier Network. He added: “Every gram that conserves natural  resources and doesn’t contribute to violations of environmental and  social standards counts.”The European Union has already implemented corresponding measures: At  the start of 2021, a new “Conflict Minerals Regulation” came into  effect that tightens the rules for importing the four conflict  minerals: gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten. Scrap turned into new toolsCarbide tools are mainly made of tungsten and are used, for example,  at the BMW Group plant in Steyr for the high-precision machining of  e-drive housings. The tools are usually resold as scrap at the end of  their useful life. In June 2021, the BMW Group will gradually begin  collecting this tool scrap from its plants in Germany and Austria for  recycling by the Austrian mining company Wolfram Bergbau und Hütten  AG. Tool scrap contains an average of more than 80% tungsten. This is  then treated using a special method to produce secondary tungsten in  powdered form;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cutting-edge research into quantum computing: BMW Group and Technical University of Munich agree to create an endowed chair in “Quantum Algorithms and Applications”. ; €5.1 million for TUM professorship, equipment and personnel   Bridge between outstanding research and industry application  Great potential of quantum computing for optimisation problems ;Munich. The BMW Group will in future be supporting  research into quantum computing at the Technical University of Munich  (TUM). Today, Prof. Thomas F. Hofmann, President of TUM, Frank Weber,  Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development, and  Alexander Buresch, CIO of BMW AG, signed an agreement to establish an  endowed chair in “Quantum Algorithms and Applications”. Over a period  of six years, the BMW Group will make a fund of €5.1 million available  to TUM for a professorship, equipment and personnel. By taking this  step, the BMW Group and TUM are seeking to bridge the gap between the  outstanding basic research carried out in Germany and its specific  application in industry. The holder of the chair will conduct applied  research into specific problems and issues in the field of quantum  computing at the same time as establishing an ongoing exchange of  knowledge and findings between TUM and the BMW Group.“It is clear to the BMW Group that quantum computing is a pioneering  technology that holds great potential for a multitude of applications  – from materials research to battery cell chemistry and the future of  automated driving using quantum machine learning,” says Frank  Weber. “This technology is at an early stage of development  and we want to provide the best possible support for cutting-edge  research and its transfer into industrial applications.”“Thanks to this collaboration, the BMW-TUM axis is set to further  strengthen Munich Quantum Valley’s reputation as Germany’s leading  ecosystem for quantum technologies,” comments Prof. Thomas F.  Hofmann. “Quantum computing could hold the key to solving the  sort of complex tasks that are beyond even today’s supercomputers. The  new endowed chair will focus on developing quantum algorithms for this  and on trialling areas of application. The generous funding from the  BMW Group will create the leverage needed to transfer the findings of  quantum physics to industrial applications.”“Close collaboration between research, industry and the startup  landscape is a prerequisite for cost-effective implementation of our  specific use cases,” explains Alexander Buresch. “The  purpose of this is to relay the requirements of industrial  applications so that they can be incorporated into the development of  quantum computing demonstrators. Our team of experts is looking  forward to joining forces with TUM and driving forward this important  field of research while focusing on its practical application.”The creation of the endowed chair underlines how the BMW Group is  endeavouring to further the sustained development of the Munich region  as a high-tech industrial base and is also a key building block for Munich Quantum  Valley, whose various initiatives have received €300 million in  funding from the Bavarian state authorities.TUM and the BMW Group already collaborate closely on a wide variety  of other topics, with notable examples including battery research,  circular economy, automated driving, artificial intelligence in  production and mobility research. On the teaching side, the BMW Group  helps to boost the practical relevance of courses with various guest  lectures and project work, while the company also enjoys a close  partnership with the TUM Institute for Lifelong Learning. Great potential for solving optimisation problems. At the BMW Group, high-performance computers handle some 2,000  computing tasks a day – such as high-end visualisations and crash/flow  simulations – for approximately 3,000 users from R&D. The bulk of  the computing operations are processed on servers in Iceland and  Sweden that run on hydroelectric and geothermal green energy, reducing  CO2 emissions by around 5,900 tonnes annually. Once a  certain level of computational complexity is reached, however, even  today’s high-performance computers hit their limit, as they process  information using a binary system, just as a laptop or smartphone  would. Bits – a contraction of ‘binary digits’ – have a value of 0 or  1. In the case of quantum computers, the smallest unit of information  is called a quantum bit, or qubit for short. Qubits can be far more  than simply 0 or 1. Phenomena of quantum mechanics, such as the  tunnelling effect, quantum entanglement and quantum interference, are  used to put qubits in superposition, a state in which they can also  assume values between 0 and 1 – and, theoretically, an infinite number  of such values at the same time.The BMW Group recognised the importance of quantum computing as a  pioneering technology for the future back in 2017, prompting it to set  up an interdisciplinary, cross-departmental project team with the task  of identifying potential uses.One of the BMW Group’s first research projects involved calculating  the optimum circuit to be followed by a robot sealing welding seams on  a vehicle. The existence of highly complex parameters means that even  the latest high-performance computers would take years to find the  optimum solution. Quantum computers are capable of computing all the  possible permutations in just a few seconds.The high level of complexity in the automotive value chain gives rise  to various multi-faceted optimisation problems in areas such as  production, parts logistics and vehicle development. It will be  possible to use quantum computers in materials research to simulate  the behaviour of material compositions at a whole new level, for  example when researching new types of battery.Another field of research that is growing in importance is quantum  machine learning, where quantum computers are used to speed up  specific processes of traditional machine learning. These innovative  learning processes for artificial intelligence could be particularly  useful for automated driving, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Everyday testing of BMW i Hydrogen NEXT with hydrogen fuel cell drive train begins.; Hydrogen as fuel for sustainable mobility: BMW Group continues systematic research and development  First prototypes being tested on European roads  Production of small series based on BMW X5 will launch in 2022 ;Munich. The BMW Group is beginning to test  near-standard vehicles with a hydrogen fuel cell drive train in  everyday conditions on European roads. Prototypes of the BMW i  Hydrogen NEXT will examine how effectively the CO2-free  drive train, model-specific chassis technology and vehicle electronics  systems work together under real-life conditions. The BMW i Hydrogen  NEXT is a pure electric vehicle that uses hydrogen as fuel by  converting it into electricity in a fuel cell. The recently launched  testing programme will pave the way for the BMW Group to present a  small-series model with this sustainable drive technology, developed  on the basis of the BMW X5, in late 2022. Extensive field testing of  these vehicles will provide practical experience in the use of this  sustainable drive technology.Hydrogen fuel cell technology has the long-term potential to  supplement internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrid systems and  battery-electric vehicles within the BMW Group’s flexible drive train  strategy. It could become an attractive alternative to  battery-electric drive trains – especially for customers who do not  have their own access to electric charging infrastructure or who  frequently drive long distances. “Hydrogen fuel cell technology can be  an attractive option for sustainable drive trains – especially in  larger vehicle classes,” according to Frank Weber, member of the Board  of Management of BMW AG responsible for Development. “That is why road  testing of near-standard vehicles with a hydrogen fuel cell drive  train is an important milestone in our research and development efforts.”Like the fuel tank of a conventional combustion-engine model, the  hydrogen tank of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT can also be filled within  three to four minutes with a fuel that ensures a range of several  hundred kilometres in all weather conditions. Field testing focused on efficiency, safety, convenience,    reliability – and driving pleasure.A central element of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT road tests now underway  is fine-tuning the software that controls all driving and operating  functions. The fuel cell system, hydrogen tanks, performance buffer  battery and central vehicle control unit have all previously been  tested individually and together in hundreds of test runs conducted on  test benches. This functional testing is now being followed with field  testing on the roads. The intensive programme, which is conducted  under everyday conditions, with thousands of kilometres driven in real  traffic situations, helps development engineers validate the  efficiency, safety, convenience and reliability of all components. At  the same time, the test series is designed to ensure the  characteristic driving pleasure of BMW models – even with locally  emission-free mobility using pioneering hydrogen fuel cell technology.The BMW i Hydrogen NEXT uses fuel cells from the product development  cooperation with the Toyota Motor Corporation. The individual cells  come from Toyota, while the fuel cell stack and complete drive system  are original BMW Group developments. The cooperation established in  2013 seeks to optimise the everyday practicality and scalability of  hydrogen fuel cell technology for use in each company’s respective  production vehicles through the intensive exchange of experience. Typical BMW driving dynamics delivered by electric drive train    with system output of 275 kW/374 hp.The complete drive system in the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT combines  hydrogen fuel cell technology with fifth-generation BMW eDrive  technology – which can already be experienced in the BMW iX3 and soon  the BMW iX and BMW i4, as well. Energy is generated in the fuel cell  as the result of a chemical reaction between the hydrogen carried by  the vehicle and oxygen from the air. This delivers an electrical  output of 125 kW/170 hp. An electric converter located below the fuel  cell adjusts its voltage to that of the electric motor, which powers  the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT.Energy stored in a performance buffer battery is also used for  dynamic acceleration manoeuvres and short bursts of speed for  overtaking. As a result, the system delivers an output of  275 kW/374 hp that corresponds exactly to that of the most powerful  six-cylinder in-line petrol engine currently used in BMW models –  thereby guaranteeing the driving dynamics the brand is known for.The energy stored in the performance buffer battery is generated in a  particularly efficient way during driving by recovering energy from  coasting overrun and braking phases. The hydrogen needed to supply the  fuel cell is stored in two 700-bar tanks made of carbon-fibre  reinforced plastic (CFRP), which together hold six kilograms of  hydrogen. Its precisely controlled reaction with oxygen in the fuel  cell generates electricity, while water vapour is the only emission  produced by the drive train.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Freedom and driving pleasure: the BMW and MINI Driving Experience for people with disabilities.;Newly designed Safety Training with specially converted vehicles starts in July 2021 and can be booked now. Theory lessons and practical driving exercises in the MINI John Cooper Works as well as in particularly sporty BMW models under the guidance of professional instructors.;Munich. The BMW and MINI Driving Experience is  expanding its offering to include Safety Training for people with  physical disabilities. From July 2021, for the first time, a  driving-oriented programme will be conducted under the guidance of  trained instructors and in specially converted BMW and MINI models.  The choice of vehicles makes it clear that in addition to safe and  confident reactions in different traffic situations, driving fun also  plays a central role. In addition to the MINI John Cooper Works (fuel  consumption combined: 7.1 - 6.8 l/100 km according to WLTP, 7.1 - 6.9  l/100 km according to NEDC;" the company has a global sales network in  more than 140 countries.In 2020, the BMW Group sold over 2.3 million passenger vehicles and  more than 169,000 motorcycles worldwide. The profit before tax in the  financial year 2020 was € 5.222 billion on revenues amounting to €  98.990 billion. As of 31 December 2020, the BMW Group had a workforce  of 120,726 employees.The success of the BMW Group has always been based on long-term  thinking and responsible action. The company set the course for the  future at an early stage and consistently makes sustainability and  efficient resource management central to its strategic direction, from  the supply chain through production to the end of the use phase of all products.www.bmwgroup.comwww.press.bmwgroup.com/deutschlandhttps://pressevents.bmwgroup.com/mini/loginFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/BMWGroupTwitter:    http://twitter.com/BMWGroupYouTube:    http://www.youtube.com/BMWGroupViewYouTube    https://www.youtube.com/MINIInstagram:    https://www.instagram.com/bmwgroupInstagram    https://www.instagram.com/mini.newsLinkedIn:    https://www.linkedin.com/company/bmw-group/""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Track facts and key factors: BMW i Andretti Motorsport ahead of the Puebla E-Prix.;In our preview, we present the most important facts and key factors of the Puebla E-Prix.;Munich. After a six-week break, the BMW i Andretti Motorsport    Team this week travels to the Puebla E-Prix (MEX), where races eight    and nine herald the second half of the season in the ABB FIA Formula    E World Championship. The permanent racetrack near the capital    Mexico City is located at 2,300 metres above sea level and is new    territory for all the teams and drivers. Jake Dennis (GBR) and    Maximilian Günther (GER) compete in qualifying groups two and three    on Saturday, as they currently lie tenth and 16th in the    Drivers’ Championship. In our preview, we present the most important    facts and key factors of the Puebla E-Prix. You can find detailed information in our media guide: https://b.mw/Formula_E_Media_Guide.  It provides detailed information on the technology behind the BMW i  drivetrain and the BMW iFE.21, background stories on the technology  transfer between motor racing and production development, the BMW i  Andretti Motorsport Team and the drivers as well as the BMW Group  safety car fleet. It is updated with facts and figures on the  respective event after each race weekend. TRACK FACTS PUEBLA.Circuit length2.93 km. Anti-clockwise.Corners16 – 7 right-handers, 9 left-handers.Track surfaceVery undulating for a permanent racetrack.Grip levelMedium. Moderate improvement of            grip expected between qualifying groups.Circuit layoutFast circuit with long straights            and many fast and medium-fast corners. Slipstream will play            an important role. T16 is part of an oval and is            consequently banked. Circuit is located at 2,300 metres            above sea level, meaning lower air pressure. In combination            with high temperatures, will be factor in battery cooling.Tyre wearRelatively high on the right            side, due to banking in T16.Top speedapprox. 245 km/h.OvertakingVery good overtaking opportunity            coming into T1.Key factorsSet-up for new circuit,            intelligent tyre management, energy management.  Quotes ahead of the Puebla E-Prix: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“We head into the second half of the season on the back of some good  results. The points we scored last time out mean we currently lie  fifth in the Team competition. We now want to close the gap to third  and fourth place. The Puebla circuit is new to us all and is a mix of  an oval circuit and a tight infield. Slipstream will definitely play  an important role on the long start/finish straight and the home  straight. We are hoping to benefit from the efficiency of the BMW i  drivetrain at what is generally a fast circuit.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21):“We kept working hard during the six-week break. I spent almost the  entire time in Germany and did some work in the BMW Motorsport  simulator to prepare as well as possible for the second half of the  season. The fact that nobody knows the circuit in Puebla is good for  me, as it means that as a rookie I am in the same position as all the  other drivers. The last time that happened was at Valencia – and I won  there. Hopefully we can get a similarly good result in Puebla.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21):“Puebla is a special challenge. The track is very flowing, has a lot  of undulations and will produce some great Formula E racing. The long  full-throttle sections on the start/finish straight, when we head back  onto the oval, will make the race very interesting. I am really  pleased that the second half of the season is getting underway in Mexico.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race. The five drivers with the most FANBOOST votes receive an extra  100 kJ of power, which they can make use of during a brief time frame  in the second half of the race.

BMW Motorrad Motorsport ends Misano weekend with tenth place for Michael van der Mark.;While BMW Motorrad Motorsport celebrated third place at the ‘24 Heures Motos’ at Le Mans with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, Sunday did not play out as hoped for the WorldSBK side of the BMW family at Misano (ITA). The best-placed rider in race two was Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team in tenth place. His team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) was twelfth.;Misano. While BMW Motorrad Motorsport celebrated third place    at the ‘24 Heures Motos’ at Le Mans with the BMW Motorrad World    Endurance Team, Sunday did not play out as hoped for the WorldSBK    side of the BMW family at Misano (ITA). The best-placed rider in    race two was Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad    WorldSBK Team in tenth place. His team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) was    twelfth. Eugene Laverty (IRL / RC Squadra Corse), who was given the    go-ahead by doctors this morning after his crash on Saturday, came    home in 15th place to pick up a point. He was followed home in 16th    place by Jonas Folger (GER / Bonovo MGM Racing). Misano hosted round    three of the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Sykes started Sunday morning’s Superpole race from fifth place on the  grid. He initially found himself in sixth after the start and crossed  the finish line in seventh after ten laps of racing. The second-best  BMW rider in the Superpole race was Laverty in 13th. Van der Mark  consistently worked his way forward from 13th place, but then crashed  out on the sixth lap. Folger, who was running behind him, was forced  to take evasive action and consequently fell back through the field,  eventually ending the Superpole race in 19th place. Van der Mark started race two on Sunday afternoon from 14th place. He  made gradual progress from lap two and crossed the finish line tenth  after 21 laps. Sykes was running sixth until the sixth lap, but then  dropped back to ninth after a battle with his rivals. Shortly after  that, he found himself in twelfth, and went on to cross the finish  line in that position. Laverty also finished in the points in 15th.  Folger was 14th for long stretches of the race, before dropping back  to 16th. Quotes after race two at Misano. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  were definitely not where we expected to be. As such, it was  disappointing. We did not manage to transfer the set-up from one  circuit to the next with either Tom or Michael. The opposition can  clearly do that better than us. All weekend we failed to give our  riders a bike on which they are competitive. In the case of Tom, we  reckoned on him taking eighth place. We must now find out why he fell  so far back. Michael’s poor grid position once again left him with a  mountain to climb. In the closing stages of the race, he was matching  the pace of the seventh and eighth-placed riders. He eventually  finished tenth, but on the whole it was disappointing because we  definitely arrived here with greater expectations. We must work on  being able to transfer a basic set-up from one circuit to the next.  Before the next races at Donington Park we will do some testing at  Navarra, where we will do our homework and work really hard.  Congratulations at this point to the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team  on their third place at Le Mans – respect to the guys. Their success  saved the Sunday a bit for us here at Misano.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It was a really tough weekend for us. We came here with some  high expectations but in the very high grip levels we found it  difficult to get Tom and Michael comfortable on the bike. We had  constant front-end chatter problems. The mechanics and the team worked  all weekend trying to find a good balance;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIM EWC: BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team makes it onto the podium after a fantastic fightback at Le Mans 24 Heures Motos.;The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team kicked off the 2021 season in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) with a podium finish. Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Xavi Forés (ESP) made a stunning fightback on the new #37 BMW M 1000 RR to finish third at the ‘24 Heures Motos’ at Le Mans (FRA). ;Le Mans. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team kicked off the    2021 season in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) with a    podium finish. Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and    Xavi Forés (ESP) made a stunning fightback on the new #37 BMW M 1000    RR to finish third at the ‘24 Heures Motos’ at Le Mans (FRA).  Werner Daemen’s team had previously qualified third. When  the endurance classic got underway at 12:00 (CEST) on Saturday,  Reiterberger made a perfect start and immediately took the lead.  However, shortly after that the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team  suffered a major set-back. A problem with the fuel system led to  several unscheduled pit stops. The team fell back to a seemingly  forlorn 43rd place, many laps behind the leaders. The team  showed fantastic fighting spirit and the three riders impressed with a  thrilling performance on the M RR. Fast lap times allowed them to  gradually work their way back towards the front of the field, one  position at a time. By the halfway point at midnight, the #37 was  already back in fifth place. Shortly after that, Mikhalchik climbed  into fourth place. On Sunday morning, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team found itself third and on course for a podium finish. They  remained in that position until Forés brought the #37 BMW M 1000 RR  home in third place after 24 hours of racing. The two  independent BMW Motorrad Motorsport teams, Team LRP Poland (#90 BMW S  1000 RR) and Team Univers Racing/AC Racing (#23 BMW S 1000 RR) failed  to finish. Round two of the FIM Endurance World  Championship, the 12-hour race in Estoril (POR), will take place on  17th July. Quotes after the 24 Heures Motos at Le Mans. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport  Director: “Congratulations to the whole BMW Motorrad World  Endurance Team on this fantastic effort. I followed the race from  Misano, where we also line up in the FIM Superbike World Championship  this weekend. However, whenever possible we had the coverage from Le  Mans on the TV and I was in constant contact with the team. After the  strong start from Markus Reiterberger, we unfortunately had an issue  with the fuel system, which saw us drop well back down the field. At  that point, you could have been forgiven for thinking that the race  was over in the first hour. However, Werner Daemen’s team and our  riders Markus, Ilya and Xavi did not stick their heads in the sand and  accepted the challenge. It was fantastic to see how they reeled in the  field from the back and consistently worked their way to the front.  They more than deserved to be stood on the podium at the end of the 24  hours. It is evidence of the team’s ability and fighting spirit. After  the early set-back, that was a good start to the season.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team: “I’m very proud about the result. The race by itself  was not the best start because of Marcus’ small crash. We had some  technical problems, and we lost about eight to nine laps. Then the  riders, and the team made a good job because we were fighting back.  Fortunately we got the third place – much more than we expected after  the first laps. The team worked perfectly together for the whole week,  and we go further like this for Estoril.” Markus Reiterberger: “I felt very honoured to ride at  the start. Even walking to the bike was good, and when I pulled away  it was really good. I really tried not to let the tyres cool and to  save fuel but the tyres were still not right up to temperature, which  really surprised me, as it was really hot. The front wheel ultimately  folded in on me in the penultimate corner and I skidded into the  gravel. I then did two more laps on the damaged bike, but then had to  come into the pits. I feel sorry for the whole team that I made this  mistake. In the end, the crash was not that bad. The main problem was  the technical issues. Once those had been resolved, we were basically  flawless for the rest of the 24 hours. I would like to thank the whole  team for their hard work, and my team-mates for persevering so valiantly.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I don’t need to say a lot of words.  The job is done, and our target has become real. Everyone is happy.  Hard work pays off for everyone from the team, especially for me  because I've been working really hard since last year. Obviously I’m  really happy to stand on the podium with my team and I hope we will  continue the same way in the next races.” Xavi Forés: “It was a really tough race for us. After  the start, we had some issues and had to come to the garage a couple  of times to solve it so we were at the bottom of the timings and then  to make it to the podium felt like a victory for us. We knew that we  are fast with our BMW M 1000 RR but could not automatically expect to  be on the podium after the first hour. I am very grateful to be part  of the team. The entire crew did an amazing job, we continued pushing  and pushing until the end of the race. This third place was also very  important for the championship and now we will give our all at  Estoril. Thanks to all who made this possible.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Tough Saturday for BMW Motorrad Motorsport at Misano WorldSBK round.;The FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) is at Misano on the Italian Adriatic coast, this weekend for round three of the 2021 season. Saturday proved to be a difficult day for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team ended the opening race in eighth and tenth place.;Misano. The FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) is at    Misano on the Italian Adriatic coast, this weekend for round three    of the 2021 season. Saturday proved to be a difficult day for BMW    Motorrad Motorsport. Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED)    from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team ended the opening race in eighth    and tenth place. Jonas Folger (GER / Bonovo MGM Racing) finished    16th, narrowly missing out on points. Eugene Laverty (IRL), riding    for the Italian RC Squadra Corse team, was unable to take part in    Superpole and race one following a crash in the morning’s free    practice session. In Saturday morning’s Superpole, Sykes finished fifth on his BMW M  1000 RR to secure a spot on the second row of the grid. Van der Mark  was 13th, while Folger came home 15th in Superpole. In the race  itself, Sykes was running in the top six until the penultimate lap.  However, he then dropped two places. Right from the word go, van der  Mark set his sights on the top ten, crossing the finish line in tenth  place after 21 laps of racing. Folger was 16th, missing out on the  points by just one-tenth of a second. Fans are permitted in the grandstands at Misano for the first time  this season. They were given a special welcome from the starting grid  by Sykes, van der Mark, Folger and BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director  Marc Bongers – with signs which said “Welcome back Fans. Bentornati.” Following his crash, Laverty was examined in the medical centre at  the circuit and was not given the go-ahead to take his place in race  one. He will now be examined again before the warm-up on Sunday  morning when it will be decided whether or not he may take part in the  Sunday sessions. Quotes after race one at Misano. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “This  Saturday was not our day. We definitely came here with greater  expectations, but it emerged on Friday that we are not close to the  podium places with both riders. Despite this, Tom still performed  strongly. It was a shame that he was unable to hold on to sixth place  in race one. In the case of Michael, it was clear yesterday and today  that we were unable to really give him the right feeling. We will now  analyse everything, but we cannot expect to make a really big jump  forward by tomorrow. Despite this, we will try to get a top-six  result. The only good news to come out of today is that Eugene is  doing relatively well, despite his big crash this morning, and that he  has not broken anything. That is the only positive news.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It was a very difficult day for us. I think the P6 position  Tom was holding would have been a strong result for us but in the end  he did not have enough tyre to hold off Bautista and Bassani, so it’s  a shame he dropped to P8 as P6 would have been a good result for Tom.  So, we will come back tomorrow, and we will fight again. Michael on  the other hand really struggled;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FIM EWC: Third place on the grid for the #37 BMW M 1000 RR and the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team at the “24 Heures Motos” in Le Mans.;The new #37 BMW M 1000 RR for the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) will start its race debut in Le Mans (FRA) from the front places of the grid. The two-part qualifying for the “24 Heures Motos” took place on Thursday and Friday. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, with regular riders Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Xavi Forés (ESP), ended the two sessions in third place.;Le Mans. The new #37 BMW M 1000 RR for the FIM Endurance World    Championship (FIM EWC) will start its race debut in Le Mans (FRA)    from the front places of the grid. The two-part qualifying for the    “24 Heures Motos” took place on Thursday and Friday. The BMW    Motorrad World Endurance Team, with regular riders Markus    Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Xavi Forés (ESP),    ended the two sessions in third place.  The starting positions are determined by taking the average of the  respective best times of the individual riders. At 1:36.099 minutes,  the average time for Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Forés was just 0.297  off pole position. The famous 24-hour race gets underway at 12:00 on Saturday. Two privateer BMW Motorrad Motorsport teams are also in action at the  “24 Heures Motos”. Team LRP Poland starts from 20th place with the #90  BMW S 1000 RR, while the Univers Racing/AC Racing team lines up in  35th place on the grid. Quotes after the Le Mans qualifying. Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “I am quite happy with qualifying. Third place, only two  tenths of a second behind the first place. That was not too bad. All  three riders have the same speed, which is really good. As is the same  for everyone, the high temperatures are a challenge. It is very hot  here. I think that we are well prepared. It will be a very long and  tough race in these temperatures – but we are confident.” Markus Reiterberger: “It was very hot in the first  qualifying session yesterday, and that is apparently something we  struggle with. The bike behaves differently in these temperatures to  during the test in spring. It was cooler today and I was the fastest  man in the team with a 1:35 lap on the new tyre – not the Qualifier.  We all improved and managed to secure third place on the grid. We saw  that we have a slight disadvantage in the heat, but that changes when  it gets cooler. Because of this, we must now consider how to pace the  race tactically. It is definitely going to be a challenging, long and  tough race, but we are feeling positive and excellently prepared.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am happy about the result.  Especially today I had a good feeling. The days before I still was  struggling a bit as the temperatures were hotter than during the test  in spring and that was a challenge for us. But the team found good  solutions for the bike, even for hot conditions, and the tyres started  to work quite well. We are confident that we can do a good job. The  important thing is to have a good start and to be constant and stable  and then, when the night comes, it should be our time, because we were  really fast in the cooler temperatures. Let’s hope for a clean race  and that we can finish in a top position after 24 hours.” Xavi Forés: “Qualifying went quite well for us. We  finished in third position and our pace was quite good. But the track  conditions were much hotter than when we were here for testing, so our  bike is working differently. Overall, it was not too bad. All three  riders have been riding on the same pace, which has to be the target  especially for the race. So yes, I am happy. The bike is working as we  want and we have to be clever for the race. We are looking forward to  start it.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Back in the top class: BMW M Motorsport confirms it will compete in LMDh from the 2023 season.;BMW M Motorsport is returning to international prototype racing. On Thursday, it was confirmed that an LMDh car is being developed for use in the North American IMSA series. From the 2023 season, this car will allow BMW M Motorsport to compete for overall race wins at such prestigious classics as Daytona, Sebring and Road Atlanta (all USA). ;Munich. BMW M Motorsport is returning to international    prototype racing. On Thursday, it was confirmed that an LMDh car is    being developed for use in the North American IMSA series. From the    2023 season, this car will allow BMW M Motorsport to compete for    overall race wins at such prestigious classics as Daytona, Sebring    and Road Atlanta (all USA).  “BMW is back on the big motorsport stage,” said Markus Flasch, CEO of  BMW M GmbH. “In entering the LMDh class, BMW M Motorsport is  fulfilling the prerequisites to challenge for overall victory at the  most iconic endurance races in the world from 2023. We will be fully  focussed on tackling this challenge. There is a spirit of optimism  here. BMW has a successful history in prototype racing – the Le Mans  victory in 1999 was unforgettable. Reviving this story in a modern  prototype with M Power will thrill fans of BMW M Motorsport. The LMDh  concept guarantees maximum cost control and offers a wide range of  possible applications, including the IMSA series in North America, an  extremely important market for BMW M. We are all eager to get stuck  into the LMDh category with a compact and highly-efficient team set-up.” Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport, is responsible for the  development, testing and race outings of the new car. He added:  “Everyone in our motorsport team shares the same motivation: we want  to test ourselves against our strongest opposition at the racetrack –  and to celebrate victories for BMW. As such, the LMDh project is a  real affair of the heart for us and exactly the new challenge we were  hoping for. An extremely exciting project awaits us. To challenge for  overall victories in Daytona and Sebring is a massive motivation. We  have a lot of work ahead of us, but the anticipation is immense.” The regulations for LMDh cars stipulate that they have both a  combustion engine and an electric motor. While each manufacturer may  develop their own combustion engine, the electric motor and battery,  as well as the transmission, are standard parts. The chassis is also  built by an external partner. A BMW M Motorsport works involvement,  with two cars, is planned from the 2023 IMSA season. The works team  and the driver line-up for the two LMDh prototypes will be announced  at a later date. The last big win for a BMW prototype came in 1999, when the BMW V12  LMR won the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The car also won the 12 Hours  of Sebring in the USA in the same season.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The first-ever BMW iX and the first-ever BMW i4: Joint global campaign plays to the rhythm of Coldplay's new hit.;"""Higher Power"" becomes the soundtrack for TV commercials for the debut of the new all-electric BMW models. Kick-off for a long-term cooperation between BMW and the Warner Music mega-band with sustainability as the unifying element.";"Munich. Local emission-free driving pleasure has  never been greater than with the first-ever BMW iX and the first-ever  BMW i4. The fitting soundtrack for the debut of the latest  all-electric models is called ""Higher Power"" and comes from  the British band Coldplay. You can hear the quartet's latest single in  the TV commercials filmed for launching the joint worldwide  communication campaign for the two new models. It delivers the perfect  message with the lyric line ""This joy is electric"". The song  for a new era of individual mobility marks the beginning of a  long-term collaboration between BMW and Coldplay.Back in 2014, Coldplay, made up of Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland, Will  Champion and Guy Berryman, performed before 1,500 fans at the end of  their ""Ghost Stories Tour"" at BMW Welt in Munich. On the  basis of the contact established at that time, a creative connection  has now been established between the premium car manufacturer and the  band, which has achieved worldwide success in the charts. This is  based in particular on a common interest in sustainability in various  areas of life.""In the initial discussions we quickly realised: Coldplay and  BMW share many common goals that go far beyond marketing,"" says  Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President Customer and Brand BMW.  ""Based on this we developed a real co-creation in which the band  actively contributed their thoughts and attitude to the design of our  campaign for the BMW iX and the BMW i4."" The shared awareness of  sustainability gave rise to an intensive creative process between BMW  and the British musicians and which will produce further co-created  elements later in the year.For the BMW Group, the premiere of the BMW iX and the BMW i4 is an  important milestone in the current phase of its transformation towards  electric mobility. The company expects all-electric models to account  for at least 50 percent of its global vehicle sales as early as 2030.  The Coldplay musicians are looking for innovative ways to combine  their popularity and performances in front of thousands of  enthusiastic fans with a positive impact with regard to  sustainability. The band said ""We are proud to partner with BMW  as part of our efforts to make everything we do as sustainable as  possible. The technology that BMW use for their electric cars can  power our live performances almost entirely from renewable energy.""For the premiere of their new song ""Higher Power"", Coldplay  already managed to overcome the usual boundaries of the music  business. Last month, Coldplay premiered ""Higher Power” in space.  The song was played for the first time by French astronaut Thomas  Pesquet on the International Space Station. Shortly after, the band  played its first live set of 2021 for earthly audiences in a special  livestream from the site of Glastonbury Festival.With the launch for the campaign film for the BMW iX and the BMW i4,  fans all over the world can now enjoy the sound of ""Higher  Power"". ""And that's just the beginning,"" announces  Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand Communication and Brand  Experience. ""We are already looking forward to being able to  realise exciting projects with regard to sustainability in an  intensive and substantial collaboration with Coldplay."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loYO_aNqYOI";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRH The Prince of Wales celebrates 20 years of modern MINI production at Plant Oxford.;In celebration of twenty successful years of modern MINI production, His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales visited the home of the brand at MINI Plant Oxford today, to meet the people behind the cars and to get an insight into the manufacturing processes and developments in sustainable production.;Munich. His Royal Highness toured the site’s assembly  hall, where he was able to meet some of the 130 apprentices, as well  as staff who were closely involved in integrating the manufacturing of  the MINI Electric onto the standard production line, making Oxford the  first BMW Group plant in the world to build fully electric and  combustion cars on the same line. The MINI Electric was launched  internationally in 2020 and has been so warmly received by customers  that production will double in 2021. The Prince of Wales drove a MINI  Electric off the production line as part of his visit. He was also  introduced to members of the MINI team whose families have worked at  the plant over a number of generations, across the decades.Peter Weber, Managing Director, Plant Oxford said: “It was an  absolute honour and pleasure to welcome HRH The Prince of Wales to the  heart of the MINI brand here in Oxford and we were delighted that he  could join us to mark this important manufacturing milestone. Over the  past twenty years, the commitment and passion of our associates,  nearly a quarter of whom were with us when the first car rolled off  the line in 2001, has helped to strengthen MINI’s reputation around  the world. It’s fantastic for this special celebration to have been be  recognised with such a memorable royal visit. It was a real highlight  to see His Royal Highness drive one of our MINI Electrics off the  production line today.”MINI Plant Oxford has been at the heart of its community for over 108  years and employs over 3700 highly-skilled employees and apprentices,  who together build 1000 MINIs a day - one every 67 seconds.MINI will be the first BMW Group brand to go fully electric by the  early 2030s.  Plant Oxford has played a pivotal role in making MINI  production more sustainable over the past 20 years and will continue  to do so as it plays an important part in BMW Group’s strategy to  reduce emissions from its production plants globally by 80 per cent by  2030, compared to 2019.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Group is a founding member of the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC).; Consortium of leading corporations creates demand for quantum computing ;"Berlin/Munich. Ten leading German corporations are  jointly founding the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium  (QUTAC). The goal of the newly founded consortium is to further  develop the existing fundamentals of quantum computing into usable  industrial applications.Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG:  ""Quantum computing is one of the most promising future  technologies and can revolutionize application fields from materials  research to automated driving. Germany and Europe need a strong  quantum computing ecosystem to be at the cutting edge of technology  and remain globally competitive. With QUTAC, we are laying the  foundation for a successful ecosystem that will allow us to make the  most of the great potential of quantum computing.""Specifically, QUTAC will help bring industry-relevant applications to  market for the technology, chemical and pharmaceutical, insurance, and  automotive industries.  This is intended to create the basis for a  successful industrialisation of quantum computing in Germany and  Europe. At the time of its founding, the consortium includes BASF, BMW  Group, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bosch, Infineon, Merck, Munich Re, SAP,  Siemens, and Volkswagen.Foundation stone for a commercially successful quantum    computing ecosystem.„In the Stimulus and Future Package, the German Government has given  a big boost to the development of Quantum Computers. Working together  with companies and start-ups we will identify, develop, trial, and  share applications. There are many highly interesting areas, e.g., in  logistics, transport, chemicals and the financial sector. So, I am  delighted that QUTAC has brought so many leading companies together to  help Germany move forward in this key sector”, says Peter Altmaier,  Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, emphasising the  importance of this alliance.Anja Karliczek, Federal Minister of Education and Research, also  welcomes the establishment of QUTAC: „Germany and Europe must become  leaders in quantum technology and then stay at the top. What we want  is technological sovereignty. To achieve this, we must rely on our  strengths. These are our top researchers with their excellent ideas on  the one hand and our strong industry on the other hand. Both must  cooperate in an optimal way. Then we will achieve the best results. We  are therefore funding companies and cutting-edge research under the  quantum technologies framework programme.”The participating companies consider an economically strong and  resilient quantum computing ecosystem in Germany and Europe to be  crucial to promote successful industrialisation and digital  sovereignty in this field. QUTAC's vision is to drive such a quantum  computing ecosystem.Jointly advancing the European quantum technology economy.QUTAC sees itself as a platform for action. The consortium promotes  applications for the commercial use of this technology that are needed  in the member companies. In doing so, they create industrial demand:  The membership includes a broad cross-section of the German economy –  thus the applications that are identified, developed, and tested  within the consortium are trendsetting for entire industries. Through  its orientation, QUTAC occupies an important position in the existing  landscape of quantum technology-related institutions.The current circle of ten members allows for a pragmatic exchange and  rapid decision-making in order to develop practical solutions in the  short and medium term. The results are intended to benefit all  participants in the ecosystem. In its position paper, QUTAC sets  specific steps: First, the need for quantum computing in the German  economy is to be identified in order to create the basis for a  cross-industry application portfolio. Currently, possible applications  are being identified and their potential for industrial implementation  is being evaluated. These reference applications will be jointly  implemented and further developed beyond the boundaries of the  consortium. The results are published on the central platform at www.qutac.de.About QUTAC.In the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium (QUTAC), some of  the largest German groups from business and industry have joined  forces to raise quantum computing to the level of large-scale  industrial application. The founding members of QUTAC include BASF,  BMW Group, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bosch, Infineon, Merck, Munich Re,  SAP, Siemens, and Volkswagen. Within the framework of various  development projects, the members are decisively driving forward the  first practical applications in the field of quantum computing in  their respective industries and also across sectors. The aim of the  consortium is to identify, develop, test, and share applications for  quantum computing and to identify funding needs.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The all-new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé.;Signature BMW driving pleasure and sporting elegance brought together with modern functionality: The new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé is poised to build on the success of its predecessor with this blend of qualities plus well-conceived enhancements to its inherent attributes and product substance. ;With the original BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé having enjoyed significant  success, a second-generation model is now being added to the latest  4 Series range. The new four-door coupé captures the imagination with  its noticeably enhanced driving dynamics, a sharper design following  the BMW brand’s new design language, a refined premium feel for its  interior and a host of innovations in the areas of operation and  connectivity. In addition to the driving pleasure and sporting  elegance for which BMW is renowned, modern functionality is central to  this gran coupé concept for the premium midsize segment. Comfortable  access to the rear compartment, five full-size seats, a large tailgate  and a variable-usage load compartment ensure the new BMW 4 Series Gran  Coupé retains its model-specific skillset in everyday driving and on  longer trips.This time around, a performance version of the new  BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé courtesy of BMW M GmbH will be available from  the car’s market launch (due to get underway in November 2021)  alongside four other model variants. All will be built under a  flexible manufacturing process at BMW Group Plant Munich on the same  line as the all-electric BMW i4 and the BMW 3 Series Sedan and BMW 3  Series Touring models.Distinctive proportions, highly versatile  interior.The standalone character of the new BMW 4  Series Gran Coupé is clearly expressed in its exterior design.  Measuring 4,783 millimetres in exterior length, 1,852 millimetres in  width and 1,442 millimetres in height, it has distinctive proportions  combined with dynamically stretched coupé lines. It is 143 millimetres  longer, 27 millimetres wider and 53 millimetres taller than its  predecessor, while the track widths have also grown –  to 1,595 millimetres at the front (+50 mm) and 1,623 millimetres at  the rear (+29 mm). The wheelbase of 2,856 millimetres is 46  millimetres longer than the predecessor’s and 5 millimetres more than  the figure for the 3 Series Sedan.The model-specific body concept results in a versatile interior  offering generous amounts of space in the rear. The new BMW 4 Series  Gran Coupé offers 470 litres of boot space, the primary capacity  in the directly viewable area of the boot having grown by 39 litres.  Load capacity can be expanded to a maximum of 1,290 litres by folding  down the sections of the rear backrest, with its standard 40 : 20 : 40 split.Expressive front end, elegant silhouette, powerful  rear.Bold lines and surfaces with a three-dimensional  structure are the defining elements of the new  BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé’s expressive front end. Dropping deep down at  its centre is the large and vertically prominent BMW kidney grille  that transmits a feeling of assured presence. The slim full-LED  headlights come with U-shaped fibre-optic light guides for the daytime  driving lights. There is also the option of Adaptive LED Headlights  with BMW Laserlight including BMW Selective Beam non-dazzling high  beam assistant.Precise lines, doors with frameless windows and flush-fitting  handles, and powerful shoulders shape the elegantly sporty silhouette  of the new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé, while the roofline culminates in a  pronounced spoiler lip on the tailgate. Horizontal lines are the  dominant influence at the rear end. And the low-slung, muscular  stature of the car is also accentuated by a rear apron with vertical  aero lips at its outer edges and a Black finish for its lower edge.  The stylishly darkened full-LED rear lights extend well into the flanks.Bespoke design features add dynamic flourishes to M Sport cars and  the BMW M model. An M Carbon exterior package can be specified as  an option, and model-specific M Performance Parts are available as  part of the Genuine BMW Accessory range.Interior: driving pleasure and spaciousness amid a premium  ambience.Inside the new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé, the  high centre console and flowing surface structure running from the  instrument panel into the door panels generate a cocooning feel in the  front seats. The Start/Stop button for the engine is positioned in a  classily designed control panel in the centre console, which also  houses the BMW Controller and the buttons for the Driving Experience  Control unit and electromechanical parking brake alongside the  model-specific gearshift lever. The rear seat bench with folding head  restraints allows three child seats to be fitted.Sport seats and a Sport leather steering wheel come as standard.  The dynamic style of the interior is accentuated in the  BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupé and in M Sport cars by features  including knee pads on the centre console. The list of optional  equipment provides extensive scope for individualisation. Driving  pleasure and comfort can be enhanced with items such as seat  heating and ventilation, Vernasca and BMW Individual leather trim  options, Sensatec or leather coverings for the instrument panel, the  M Sport package Pro, a large glass slide/tilt sunroof, ambient  lighting and the Harman Kardon Surround Sound System.State-of-the-art four- and six-cylinder engines and 48V mild    hybrid technology provide clear boost for dynamism and  efficiency.The new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé underscores  its vividly enhanced sporting credentials with a performance model at  the top of the range. The BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupé (fuel  consumption combined: 8.5 – 8.0 l/100 km [33.2 – 35.3 mpg imp] in the  WLTP test cycle; CO2 emissions  combined: 166 – 150 g/km in WLTP) produces maximum output of  135 kW/184 hp. And a 140 kW/190 hp four-cylinder diesel engine can be  found under the bonnet of the BMW 420d Gran Coupé (fuel consumption  combined: 5.4 – 4.8 l/100 km [52.3 – 58.9 mpg imp] in WLTP;  CO2 emissions combined: 141 – 126 g/km in WLTP) and  BMW 420d xDrive Gran Coupé (fuel consumption combined: 5.7 – 5.1 l/100  km [49.6 – 55.4 mpg imp] in WLTP;" CO2 emissions combined:  150 – 133 g/km in WLTP).In the BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupé and the diesel variants of the new  car, mild hybrid technology further increases dynamism and efficiency.  The 48V starter-generator puts an extra 8 kW/11 hp on tap when  accelerating off the line or putting in a quick burst of speed. An  additional battery helps to further expand the scope for regenerating  and storing brake energy.All the engines team up with an eight-speed Steptronic transmission  as standard. Meanwhile, the optional eight-speed Steptronic Sport  transmission (standard in the BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupé) complements  its sharper shift dynamics and shift paddles on the steering wheel  with a Sprint function. This prompts the powertrain and shift  characteristics to maximise dynamic performance when putting in a  sudden burst of speed or overtaking.High body rigidity, optimised aerodynamic  attributes.The sporting characteristics of the new  BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé are also well served by a low centre of  gravity and almost 50 : 50 weight distribution. An intelligent  material mix has been employed to optimise the weight of both the body  and chassis technology. And the bespoke body struts at the front end  and in the rear axle area can also take credit for the car’s superb  handling agility and precision.An active air flap control system comprising flaps at the top and  bottom, plus air curtains and an almost completely sealed underbody  optimise the car’s aerodynamics. The drag coefficient (Cd)  of 0.26 measured for the BMW 420d Gran Coupé, for example, represents  a reduction of 0.02 over its predecessor.Sophisticated chassis technology with model-specific  tuning.Model-specific geometry, mounting and tuning for  the sophisticated chassis technology in the new BMW 4  Series Gran Coupé imbue it with exceptional dynamic assurance. The  two-joint spring strut front axle and five-link rear axle have  likewise been engineered to reduce weight while increasing rigidity.  Standard-fitted lift-related dampers enhance both sports performance  and ride comfort. Depending on the spring travel, these provide extra  damping to control body movement when driving over large bumps, as  well as preventing excessive dive. The system reacts to minor  imperfections in the road surface with low damping forces that produce  high levels of comfort.The lift-related dampers are particularly firm in nature on the  BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupé and on cars with the optional M Sport  suspension specified. The adaptive M suspension available as an option  combines the characteristics of M Sport suspension with electronically  controlled dampers, and therefore offers the widest possible range  of driving experiences on the sporty-to-comfortable spectrum.  Variable sport steering is included with both optional suspension  variants. Also available as an option are M Sport brakes (standard on the BMW M440i xDrive Gran Coupé).The new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé comes as standard with 17-inch  light-alloy wheels. Standard specification for the new BMW M440i  xDrive Gran Coupé includes 18-inch M light-alloy wheels and an M Sport  differential with electronically controlled, fully variable locking  function in the rear differential. This is also available as an option  for the BMW 430i Gran Coupé if M Sport suspension or adaptive  M suspension is specified.Wide array of driver assistance systems.Some  40 assistance functions designed to enable comfortable and  safe driving and parking are available as standard or options for the  new BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé. Highlights include Active Cruise Control  with automatic Speed Limit Assist, route monitoring and traffic light  recognition (in Germany), plus Steering and Lane Control Assistant.Standard specification comprises front collision warning, Speed Limit  Info, Lane Departure Warning, Park Distance Control, the Reversing  Assist Camera and Parking Assistant with Reversing Assistant. Parking  Assistant Plus with Surround View and Remote 3D View can also be  ordered as an option.Advanced connectivity and new digital  services.The driver and passengers in the new BMW 4  Series Gran Coupé benefit from the extended possibilities provided by  BMW Operating System 7 as standard. Customers can take their pick of  control interface for the situation at hand: control display  touchscreen, familiar BMW Controller, multifunction buttons on the  steering wheel, voice control or optional BMW gesture control. There  is also access to a range of highly advanced digital services,  including the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, BMW Digital Key,  Connected Music and Remote Software Upgrades.The standard-fitted BMW Live Cockpit Plus comprises the iDrive  operating system with 8.8-inch control display and a 5.1-inch colour  display in the instrument cluster. The optional BMW Live Cockpit  Professional features a fully digital screen grouping including a  high-resolution instrument cluster with a screen diagonal of  12.3 inches behind the steering wheel and a 10.25-inch control display.The cloud-based BMW Maps navigation system offers extremely fast and  precise route calculation and arrival times, real-time traffic data  updates at short intervals and the ability to enter any word when  searching for a destination. With smartphone integration fitted as  standard, customers can use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto via the  car’s operating system. And the Remote Software Upgrades function  allows improved vehicle functions and additional digital services to  be imported into the car over the air.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The new BMW X3 and the new BMW X4.;New look, improved equipment and an optimised range structure for the customer: BMW has given its successful Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) BMW X3 and the Sports Activity Coupé (SAC) BMW X4 a comprehensive refresh. ;Sportier, more modern and more digital. For the second phase of the  model cycle, BMW has refreshed its successful Sports Activity Vehicle  (SAV) BMW and the Sports Activity Coupé (SAC) BMW with a new look,  improved equipment and a range structure which has been optimised for  customers. The redesigned front end and revised rear section lend even  clearer emphasis to the robust off-road look and sporty appearance of  the third-generation BMW X3. Its coupé counterpart, the  second-generation BMW X4, adopts the new front end, adds its own  accentuation with the exclusive BMW mesh kidney grille and offers a  particularly dynamic rear end. The refresh is rounded off with a  modern interior with new equipment features and updated infotainment.  BMW M GmbH is also upgrading the M models of the BMW X3 and BMW X4 at  the same time (see here).Modern drive technology and a clearer product structure.The introduction of mild hybrid technology with 48-‑volt‑starter  generator now also with all petrol engines ensures a broad drive  portfolio at the cutting edge of technology. These include the BMW X3  xDrive30e (combined fuel consumption, weighted: 2.6 – 2.0 l/100 km  according to WLTP; combined CO2‑emissions: 216 – 199 g/km  according to WLTP) and the BMW X3 M40d (combined fuel consumption:  7.3 – 6.6 l/100 km according to WLTP; combined  CO2‑emissions: 192 – 173 g/km according to WLTP).New BMW kidney grille and flatter  headlights.With the redesigned BMW kidney grille,  headlights that are around ten millimetres flatter and the new front  apron, the BMW X3 looks almost like a new vehicle. More strikingly  shaped, especially in the upper area, the BMW kidney grille is larger  than before and now comprises a single-piece frame. A black bar in  which the iCam is positioned if fitted ensures visual separation of  the grille. The front headlights feature full LED technology as  standard. In addition to the optional adaptive LED headlights with  Matrix function, where the adverse weather light takes on the function  of the previously separate fog lights, the BMW Laser Light with a  range of up to 650 metres is now also available as an optional extra.Front apron and rear apron redesigned.Below the headlights, vertical air intakes arranged in a  triangular interpretation frame the front bumper. In the new front  apron, taut and amply-sized surfaces in body colour and the robust  underbody protection reinforce the presence and high-quality aura of  the SAV. The BMW X3 xDrive30e with plug-in hybrid drive also bears an  “electrified by i” emblem on the front wing, while an additional blue  ring adorns all BMW logos on this engine version, including those on  the wheel hub covers. The rear section of the new BMW X3 offers  greater clarity as a result of various measures. A black border gives  the full LED rear lights a more precise appearance, while the narrower  light graphic now includes a three-dimensionally modelled pincer  contour and horizontal turn signals integrated in filigree style. The  emphasis on horizontal lines, for example in the concave area at the  lower end of the tailgate, contributes to the tidy impression of the  rear. The newly designed and elaborately painted underbody protection  provides a powerful finish to the road. The new, flush-fitting  free-form tailpipe trims are larger and sportier, conveying a more  powerful presence.M sports package with specific exterior details.The M sports package gives the BMW X3 a sportier orientation.  The specific front apron features significantly larger air inlets and  inserts finished in high-gloss black, as well as more pronounced air  curtains. The window graphics, roof rails and BMW kidney frame and  bars are optionally available in high-gloss black. The sportier rear  bumper includes a more striking diffuser finished in Dark Shadow along  with two additional side air‑curtain‑panels in high-gloss black. The  standard trim includes the new 19-inch Y‑Spoke 887M alloy wheel in  Midnight Grey Bicolor with 245/50 R19 tyres. Additional wheels in 20  inch and 21 inch are available as an option, as well as the M sports  brake with blue or red brake calipers.Further M insignia in the M Performance cars.Further visual differentiation is offered by the BMW X3 M40i and  the BMW X3 M40d, which show their affiliation to the BMW M GmbH  portfolio with a specific BMW M kidney. In addition to a chrome frame,  it bears the typical M double grille bars in high-gloss black and with  an M logo. While the same aprons as in the M sports package are to be  found at the front and rear, the aerodynamically optimised M exterior  mirrors in high-gloss black, the free-form tailpipe trims in black  chrome and the striking “Two Teeth” design ensure a distinctive look.  The BMW X3 M40i and BMW X3 M40d are fitted as standard with 20‑inch M  light alloy wheels double-spoke 699M in Orbit Grey with the mixed  tyres 245/45 R20 at the front and 275/40 R20 at the rear. As an  optional extra, these wheels are available in Jet Black, while other  exclusive options include the 21-inch M light alloy wheels double  spoke 718M in Jet Black burnished.BMW mesh kidney grille as an exclusive distinguishing feature    of the BMW X4.The BMW X4 adopts the new front end of the BMW X3, but adds an  exclusive distinguishing feature in the form of the mesh kidney  familiar from other sporty BMW models. Compared to the BMW X3, the  adaptive LED headlights with Matrix function are already standard,  while the BMW Laser Light, which is particularly light-intensive and  has a long range, is also available as an option for the BMW X4.  Featuring flat full LED rear lights that emphasise the vehicle width  and protrude strikingly from the vehicle body in their  three-dimensional design, the rear section now has an even more  clear-cut shape in the BMW X4 revision. The new rear apron has a  tidier appearance, with an increased proportion of painted surface and  reflectors now placed vertically and lower in the bumper. The wide  free-form tailpipe trims echo the horizontal lines of the upper section.M sports package with striking rear apron in the BMW X4.From the M sports package onwards, the BMW X4 features the  BMW mesh kidney, the frame and inserts of which are painted in  high‑gloss black on request, as well as a new rear apron with a wide,  offset insert in the shape of an anvil. Like the side  air‑curtain‑panels, this is finished in high-gloss black and gives a  powerful overall impression that is distinctly road-oriented. As with  the BMW X3, the M sports package includes the new 19-inch alloy wheel  Y‑-Spoke 887M in Midnight Grey Bicolor with 245/50 R19 tyres as  standard. Additional 20-inch and 21-inch wheels and the M sports brake  are available as options.BMW M insignia for the BMW X4 M40i and BMW X4 M40d.The BMW X4 M40i (combined fuel consumption: 9.5 – 8.7 l/100 km  according to WLTP; combined CO2‑emissions: 215 – 198 g/km  according to WLTP) and the BMW X4 M40d (combined fuel  consumption: 7.3 – 6.6 l/100 km according to WLTP;" combined  CO2‑emissions: 190 – 171 g/km according to WLTP) are based  on the appearance and standard equipment of the corresponding  X3 models and, like these, bear typical BMW M insignia such as  the specific BMW M kidney with chrome frame, double kidney bars in  high‑gloss black and M logo as well as the aerodynamically optimised  M exterior mirrors in high-gloss black. The rear apron with its  anvil-shaped insert is complemented by air curtain trim in high-gloss  black. Analogous to the BMW X3 M40i and BMW X3 M40d are the free-form  tailpipe trims in black chrome with the two """"teeth"""" and the tyres.Eleven paint finishes for the BMW X3 and one exclusively for the BMW X4.Following the redesign of the BMW X3, BMW offers a total of  eleven paint finishes in the regular range. The metallic paint finish  Skyscraper Grey (from 12/21) is new, and as is M Brooklyn Grey  metallic from the M sports package upwards, along with the two BMW  Individual paint finishes Aventurine Red and Tanzanite Blue. The new  metallic finish Piedmont Red is available exclusively for the BMW X4.  For the first time there is also a choice of numerous special BMW  Individual paint finishes for the two models, including matt finishes  such as Frozen Deep Grey. The range of special finishes available is  to be further expanded in the future.Significantly revised interior.The new BMW X3 and the new BMW X4 adopt the centre console  of the current BMW 4 Series. The free-standing, central Control  Display with touch function now offers a screen diagonal of 10.25  inches as standard in all vehicles. A 12.3-inch version of the touch  display is also available as an option. The significantly improved  standard equipment now also includes sports seats with covers from a  new Sensatec generation in the new Ray grain and with perforated main  seat surfaces, as well as automatic climate control with 3-zone  control. In order to make the vehicle configuration process clearer  and more straightforward for customers, not least reducing the number  of conflicts, the complexity of the equipment lines and optional  extras has deliberately been reduced by 30 per cent. In addition to  the cupholder and a model-specific emblem, the centre console  accommodates the newly designed control island with the gear selector  lever, buttons for the start/stop system, the electric parking brake,  hill descent control and various driving experience functions as well  as the BMW Controller. The engine start button is positioned here,  too. New electroplated trim elements on the air vents add a touch of  elegance while emphasising the horizontal lines in the interior.  Additional functions are offered by the optional extra Ambient Light,  which features contour lighting above the decorative trim in the  dashboard and ambient lighting that shines gently downwards below the  accent trim to create a particularly high-quality, relaxing atmosphere  in the interior.Hybrid technology for all engines.The new BMW X3 and the new BMW X4 demonstrate increasing  electrification with modern hybrid technology in connection with  all seven drive systems available in Germany. In addition to the  BMW X3 xDrive30e with plug-in hybrid drive, which has been in  production since December 2019, all 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder engines  in the two model series now use 48-volt mild hybrid technology.

GT3 premiere at Nürburgring 24 Hours: BMW Junior Team ‘passed master’s exam’ despite retirement.;After the 2020 class win in the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW Junior Team made a strong debut in the BMW M6 GT3 at the 2021 edition of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER). Alongside Augusto Farfus (BRA), Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) showed strong speed and fighting spirit in the race, but were not rewarded with a good result. ;Munich. After the 2020 class win in the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW    Junior Team made a strong debut in the BMW M6 GT3 at the 2021    edition of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER). Alongside Augusto Farfus    (BRA), Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA)    showed strong speed and fighting spirit in the race, but were not    rewarded with a good result. Despite the disappointment over the    wrong tyre selection at the start and the retirement due to a    technical defect shortly before the end of the race, the general    conclusion of everyone involved is positive. “We went into this race with very ambitious goals and definitely  wanted to get a top-ten result with the BMW Junior Team. For a while  it looked like we might even improve on that goal. A top-five result  was within reach but unfortunately the course of the race ended up  writing a different story,” summed up mentor Jochen Neerpasch. “I  still think that the BMW Junior Team passed the master’s exam with  their performance.” It was a weekend of firsts. Hesse experienced the first of these in  top qualifying when, after Farfus’ perfect groundwork in putting the  #77 BMW M6 GT3 in the pole position shootout, he completed his first  GT3 laps in the rain on the Nordschleife. He mastered this challenge  flawlessly and secured tenth on the grid ahead of many Nürburgring  experts with significantly more experience. “We started the weekend  well and got ourselves a good starting position,” said Hesse. Strong recovery performance after unlucky start.In light of the extremely difficult track conditions, at the start of  the race BMW Team RMG and starting driver Farfus opted for the wrong  tyres for their 24-hours debut with the BMW M6 GT3. Farfus pitted  right after the formation lap and was given wet tyres – a 50/50  decision since some sections of the track were wet and some were dry.  Unfortunately heavier rain didn’t start until so much later that  Farfus was unable to keep using his wet tyres and make up the time he  lost due to the pit stop. “It was really difficult to gauge the  weather conditions at the start, and unfortunately we opted for the  wrong tyres,” said team principal Stefan Reinhold. After that, things went very well until the race was red-flagged on  Saturday evening due to fog, and again after the restart on Sunday.  Flawless stints saw Farfus, Hesse and Harper move up the field. “Up  until the red flag and again after the restart our strategy was aimed  at making up as much ground as possible which we managed,” explained  Reinhold. Verhagen experienced his first at the restart;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

He began his theatre career in the dramaturge  team under Gerard Mortier at the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels,  moving from here to the Festival of Flanders, where was appointed  Artistic Director in 1987. He revitalised the festival programme with  a new repertoire and an innovative oﬀering of baroque and  contemporary, invited big, signiﬁcant orchestras and engaged a series  of conductors starting out on their careers, among them Iván Fischer,  Valery Gergiev, Simon Rattle and Esa-Pekka Salonen, for example. He  was appointed General Director and Artistic Director of the London  Philharmonic Orchestra in 1996, where he corrected the ﬁnancial  situation and re-established the orchestra’s artistic excellence. Kurt  Masur was made Principal Conductor and Vladimir Jurowski was appointed  Principal Guest Conductor, and the cooperation with Bernard Haitink,  Mariss Jansons and Wolfgang Sawallisch was intensified. Serge Dorny  has pursued an innovative artistic policy since his appointment as  General Director of the Opéra national de Lyon in 2003. His bills has  combined major works of the repertoire with lesser-known operas,  developed thematic festivals and aﬀorded the music of the 20th century  and contemporary works a truly special signiﬁcance. He has invited  outstanding conductors such as William Christie, Lothar Koenigs,  Stefano Montanari, Kazushi Ono, Kirill Petrenko, Jérémie Rhorer and  Daniele Rustioni, recruited ﬁlm and theatre directors such as  Christophe Honoré, David Marton and Wajdi Mouawad for the opera, and  established a continuous cooperation with renowned stage artistes such  as Romeo Castellucci, Robert Lepage, La Fura dels Baus (Àlex Ollé),  Laurent Pelly, Olivier Py and Dmitri Tcherniakov. His initiative to  make the opera house’s artistic oﬀering accessible to audiences that  previously had very few points of contact with musical theatre, and to  bring them closer with special activities, such as the regular art and  culture programme, now enjoys international renown here. In 2017, the  Opéra national de Lyon was named Opera House of the Year by the  British press’s International Opera Awards and also declared Opera  House of the Year with the “Opernwelt” specialist opera journal’s  critics' vote.

   BMW Motorrad Motorsport returns to happy hunting ground at Misano with the BMW M 1000 RR.;After the double-header in Spain and Portugal, BMW Motorrad Motorsport is now heading to the third round of the FIM Superbike World Championship 2021 (WorldSBK) at Misano, Italy. The circuit on the Adriatic coast has proved to be a happy hunting ground in the past. In 2019, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Tom Sykes (GBR) celebrated the first podium finish there for a WorldSBK project that was still in its infancy.;Munich. After the double-header in Spain and Portugal, BMW    Motorrad Motorsport is now heading to the third round of the FIM    Superbike World Championship 2021 (WorldSBK) at Misano, Italy. The    circuit on the Adriatic coast has proved to be a happy hunting    ground in the past. In 2019, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Tom    Sykes (GBR) celebrated the first podium finish there for a WorldSBK    project that was still in its infancy. The Misano race did not take    place last year due to the Coronavirus pandemic. BMW Motorrad Motorsport is now hoping to build on that successful  2019 appearance at Misano with the new BMW M 1000 RR, which is in its  first season as the WorldSBK race bike. Sykes will be joined by  Michael van der Mark (NED) in the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Misano  is the home race for the BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse. Eugene  Laverty (IRL) is competing for the Italian team. Jonas Folger (GER)  from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing is also very familiar  with the circuit. Quotes ahead of the Misano round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  are heading to Misano with plenty of optimism. The first two races of  the season at MotorLand Aragón and Estoril took place on circuits that  we already knew would be challenging for us. Nonetheless, we were able  to record some satisfying results, and even more importantly, we were  able to test our new BMW M 1000 RR extensively under racing  conditions. We know where our strengths lie and where we still have  some work to do. In Misano, the situation is completely different to  how it was at the first two circuits on the calendar. We have some  good memories of Misano and were able to show that how much we like  this circuit at the last race there in 2019. Of course, we will never  forget the first podium finish with Tom. Now we are confident that we  can put on a strong performance at Misano with the new M RR.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “First of all, we are delighted to return to Misano after  missing out last year. For sure, 2019 was a very good event for the  BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and now to return with the BMW M 1000 RR  will be good to compare our improvements. Hopefully we can repeat that  success from 2019. We are going into the weekend both Michael and Tom  coming back from Estoril with some new direction. For sure, Michael is  starting to feel very acclimatised with his electronic feel of his M  RR and that’s really important. He is really starting to feel like the  bike can do exactly what he wants and that's a good step for him so  his confidence is very strong in that area. On the other side, Tom  still has some concerns over his chassis direction and we will work on  that in Friday’s practices. But hopefully quickly Tom can get into a  good rhythm and can prepare himself ready for Superpole and the races.  We hope we can get some good conditions in the weather and we have  some straight forward races with no weather causing any issues because  the forecast predicts some thunderstorms around that time. Overall as  a team, we are happy to return, we feel quite confident that the  Misano circuit should be favourable for us and we are ready to get on track.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Misano is one of my favourite tracks. I really missed going  there last year. I love the circuit, I love the layout and I am  looking forward to it. It’s a completely different track again  compared to Aragón and Estoril but I think it will suit the BMW very  well and especially the way the bike is working now. After some good  results at Aragón and Estoril a very different track and I think we  can do really well there. Regarding goals for the weekend, I think it  is still difficult to say where we expect to be but I think we should  be close to the top five. We had some good results, the gap is still a  little bit too big but I think the way the Misano track is we can do  really well.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am  obviously looking very much forward to the Misano round of the  WorldSBK calendar. It’s a circuit I really enjoy. It will certainly be  tight in terms of lap times as it is quite small and twisty so we’re  really looking to be competitive. We’ve had some strong results there  in the past with the BMW S 1000 RR so hopefully with the updated M RR  we can improve on those. That’s certainly my target and it would be  fantastic.  We’ve had a podium success there so if we could do  something similar this weekend it’s what we need. Overall, it’s a  fantastic location and I am looking forward to getting out there.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “I’m heading to  Misano feeling very optimistic. I set modest goals for myself last  time out due to the fact that Estoril was the toughest track on the  calendar for us last year. However, I far exceeded my expectations so  my confidence is high going to a track that I really enjoy. The new  BMW M 1000 RR has made a huge step forward this year and I’m very  thankful for the hard work done by everybody at BMW Motorrad  Motorsport during the winter months. I have gelled very well with my  new team RC Squadra Corse and we’re ready to begin moving up the  order. The first two rounds were like pre-season testing for us. I  feel that our season begins properly at round three at Misano.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I am looking  forward to Misano. It will be interesting to see how the BMW M 1000 RR  feels on this circuit. I am hoping for a consistent weekend, and that  we can finish in good positions. I think we will be satisfied with  that. I also hope that we can settle on the right basic set-up for the  bike at Misano which we can then use in the other races.”  Track Facts Misano.Circuit        length4.226          km – clockwiseCorners16 – 10 right-handers, 6 left-handersPole        positionRightLongest        straight510          metres (start-finish straight)Grip levelMediumTrack        layoutSeveral long straights, partly fast corners,          hard braking zonesStrain on        brakesMediumAmount at full        throttle30 %Topspeed / lowest        speed276          km/h / 55 km/hBest overtaking        opportunityT1, T8Key        factorsGood          feeling on the brakes, stability, traction ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Farewell podium for the BMW M6 GT3: last-year’s winners ROWE Racing finish in second place.;After claiming victory last year, ROWE Racing reached the podium once again at the 49th edition of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER). ;Nürburgring. After claiming victory last year, ROWE Racing    reached the podium once again at the 49th edition of the Nürburgring    24 Hours (GER). At the farewell appearance of the BMW M6 GT3, which    will be replaced by the BMW M4 GT3 in 2022, Sheldon van der Linde    (RSA), Martin Tomczyk (GER), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Connor De    Phillippi (USA) finished second in the #98 car. Having started from    25th on the grid, the quartet put on an impressive recovery    performance and crossed the finish line just 8.8 seconds behind the    victorious Porsche. This proved to be the shortest-ever edition of    the race after thick fog interrupted the event for more than 14 hours. On Saturday afternoon, Tomczyk had laid the foundations for success  in difficult conditions featuring soaking-wet sections of track as  well as dry areas. He moved up from 25th position to third place  during his double stint. In the final stage after the restart around  midday on Sunday, van der Linde was involved in a thrilling duel for  victory with the #911 Porsche. In the end, ROWE Racing was not even  ten seconds away from defending their title. The team’s #1 car, with  Nick Catsburg (NED), Nick Yelloly (GBR), John Edwards (USA) and  Philipp Eng (AUT) at the wheel, started from pole position and led the  field for the restart, but then fell back when regulations required a  long pit stop after the red flag on Saturday evening. Shortly  thereafter, the car was forced to retire due to a technical defect. Schubert Motorsport also gave a strong performance. Jens Klingmann  (GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN), Alexander Sims (GBR) and Stef Dusseldorp  (NED) were on course for a podium finish for some time but then  suffered some bad luck with Code 60 periods in the final stage and  crossed the line in sixth place. BMW Junior Team was unrewarded for a strong debut in the BMW M6 GT3  at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and  Neil Verhagen (USA) were joined by Augusto Farfus (BRA) as they worked  their way back to the top ten thanks to some great lap times after  selecting the wrong tyres at the start of the race. However, Farfus  started to struggle with technical problems 30 minutes from the end  and was hit from behind by another car as he slowed down. That marked  the end of the race for the BMW Team RMG #77 BMW M6 GT3. Walkenhorst  Motorsport put two of its BMW M6 GT3s in the top 20, finishing in  twelfth and 15th. BMW M CEO Markus Flasch (AUT) finished fourth in the CUP5 class with  the #241 BMW M2 CS Racing. Competing for Adrenalin Motorsport, he  shared the car with Jörg Weidinger, Matthias Malmedie and Niki Schelle  (all GER). Reactions after the race: Markus Flasch (CEO BMW M GmbH): “What a race for the  BMW M Motorsport family! We are delighted with this second place for  the BMW M6 GT3 and the ROWE Racing team. Congratulations to the team  and the drivers of the #98 car. They showed how strong the BMW M6 GT3  remains, even at this age, and that it can still battle for victory.  Unfortunately, their team-mates endured some bad luck with the #1 car  and had been among the favourites to win the race. The Schubert  Motorsport car was also involved in the battle for a podium result for  a long period. We had a very good set-up at the top. BMW Junior Team  also gave a strong performance until being forced to retire just  before the end of the race. Congratulations to the lads and Augusto  Farfus for a strong performance. It was definitely a fine way for the  BMW M6 GT3 to mark its farewell at this classic event. At the same  time, we are also really looking forward to the BMW M4 GT3, which we  presented here at the Nürburgring this weekend. We will be competing  with the new car at this race in the future. This will put us back on  the attack. Personally, I had a lot of fun getting out on the track in  this race with the BMW M2 CS Racing. That was a unique experience. I  would certainly not rule out competing again in 2022. I would also  like to thank the many other BMW M Motorsport teams who celebrated  class wins and gave a great battling performance. We are very proud of  the BMW M Motorsport family at the Nürburgring. And of course, the  same also applies to the huge BMW M fan community for their superb  support. Congratulations to Porsche and the Manthey team on their  overall win.” Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Once again,  that was anything but a normal race here at the Nürburgring. We made  it through the difficult opening stage really well. When the race was  stopped, we had three cars in the top six but the interruption lasted  for a very long time. Race control definitely made the right decision.  We then had a three-and-a-half-hour sprint race. Unfortunately, we  lost two cars due to technical problems, while the Schubert team and  the #98 from ROWE Racing were battling for podiums and the win.  Overall, our drivers and teams gave a faultless performance under the  most challenging conditions. Congratulations to the Manthey team on  their win.” Hans-Peter Naundorf (ROWE Racing team principal): “We  reached the podium thanks to a fantastically good performance from our  drivers. The conditions in the opening stage were extremely difficult,  however, the #98 car was still able to make great progress. Martin’s  starting stint was sensational - it was like seeing the rain god  walking on water. Sheldon was in the car for nearly three hours at the  end and he applied some great pressure. The race was just a bit too  short for us. We might have been able to achieve more over the full  distance. The #1 car also gave a great performance but unfortunately a  technical defect ended its race.” Martin Tomczyk (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 2nd  place): “After qualifying, we would never have expected to  move to the front so quickly during the race. It is always wonderful  to stand on the podium at this 24-hour race. The ROWE Racing team, BMW  M Motorsport and my three fellow drivers all put so much work into  this race. We have been rewarded for that. It was so much fun. A great  result, and one that I was not really expecting.” Sheldon van der Linde (#98 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Racing, 2nd  place): “Considering our grid position, that is an  unbelievable result. I could see the Manthey Porsche on Döttinger  Höhe. It was so tight. Of course, it does hurt a little but we really  should not be disappointed. My triple stint at the end was not half  bad, I really gave it everything. But it was not to be.  Congratulations to Manthey, they earned the win.” Marco Wittmann (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 2nd  place): “In the end, we can be very pleased with that second  place, even though it is a little disappointing to finish not even ten  seconds behind the winners. When we started from 25th on the grid on  Saturday, we had no expectation of finishing the race on the podium.  It was Martin Tomczyk who put us in this position with his  unbelievable opening double stint. In general, we worked really well  as a team. That is my first podium at a 24-hour race. I am really  pleased with that.” Connor De Phillippi (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 2nd  place): “I am grateful for having been part of such a great  team. I think that our car had the potential to win but the conditions  were unbelievably tough at times. In the end, luck was not entirely on  our side but I am sure we will get another chance.” Jesse Krohn (#20 BMW M6 GT3, Schubert Motorsport, 6th  place): “Our car was definitely good enough for the podium  but luck was just not on our side. We had two Code 60 periods towards  the end of the race, which our rivals did not have. That cost us a lot  of time and you can’t make it back up. Nonetheless, we are happy to  have made it to the finish. But we could have done better.” Neil Verhagen (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team, DNF):  “I think that this 24-hour race on the Nordschleife is the most fun  I’ve ever had in a racing car in all my life. You are simply always  driving right on the limit here. I have never experienced anything  like it at any other circuit. Being able to drive the restart after  the interruption was a major highlight for me. I just gave it  everything and had tunnel vision. My first 24-hour race in a GT3 car  was just crazy. It’s a shame that we couldn’t get the car to the  finish line in the end.” Philipp Eng (#1 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, DNF): “We  were doing really well. Our starting drivers in particular, Nick and  Martin in the other car, did a phenomenal job of keeping the cars on  the track during this difficult stage. Unfortunately, the red flag  with the new regulation for the time required for a pit stop did not  help us at all. We had to stay there for an unbelievably long time and  then we knew we would have to drive right on the limit. I don’t think  we have often pushed as hard on the Nordschleife as we did today, but  then we had a technical issue. I no longer had full power and had to  retire the car.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
After 4 hours: BMW M Motorsport teams survive turbulent opening stage to battle for the lead.;The BMW M Motorsport teams managed to avoid any accidents during the turbulent opening stage of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER) and are battling for top positions after four hours of racing. ;Nürburgring. The BMW M Motorsport teams managed to avoid any    accidents during the turbulent opening stage of the Nürburgring 24    Hours (GER) and are battling for top positions after four hours of    racing. Heavy rain on parts of the Nordschleife and dry stretches in    in other areas made tyre selection extremely difficult. Both ROWE    Racing and Schubert Motorsport displayed a knack for making the    right choice. The three cars for the two teams are now in the top    five on a much drier track. The chasing performance given by Martin    Tomczyk (GER) was particularly impressive, as the starting driver in    the #98 BMW M6 GT3 from ROWE Racing moved up from 25th on the grid    to third place.  BMW Junior Team endured some poor luck in the opening stage however.  Together with BMW Team RMG, Augusto Farfus (BRA) decided to switch to  wet-weather tyres immediately after the formation lap. That proved to  be a premature decision, as the expected rain did not appear straight  away. An additional pit stop pushed the #77 BMW M6 GT3 further back.  The best-placed Walkenhorst Motorsport car is the #102 BMW M6 GT3.  Like the BMW Junior Team car, it is still in the top 20. The #241 BMW M2 CS Racing, featuring BMW M CEO Markus Flasch (AUT) at  the wheel, lost time due to a break for repairs and is in fifth place  in the CUP5 class. Reactions from the drivers: Nick Catsburg (#1 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “I think  I aged by about five years in those two hours after the start. With  the type of wet-weather tyres that we had put on, it was extremely  difficult to keep the car on the track through those wet passages.  That’s why I was very careful and lost some time in that phase. Things  got better as the track dried out. The main thing is that I was able  to get the car back and we are still right in the race.” Martin Tomczyk (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “I had  an unbelievable amount of fun during my chase. It was my first race in  the rain on the Nordschleife for about a year but our preparations  with the car were outstanding and I was able to show that you are not  on the scrapheap at 39 years of age. I have the experience and I know  where the standing water is most likely to be in these conditions, and  where I have to be careful.” Jens Klingmann (#20 BMW M6 GT3, Schubert Motorsport):  “I am proud that we were able to manage this opening stage so well. It  was very difficult out there, especially during the first laps after  our switch to wet-weather tyres. We did not risk it all, as you have  it all to lose during the opening phase of such a long race.  Unfortunately, we lost a few seconds during the pit stop but there is  still a long way to go in the race. We will catch up.” Augusto Farfus (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team):  “Unfortunately, we made the wrong decision at the start. We thought  that it would rain a bit more right from the word go, and we switched  to wet-weather tyres after the formation lap. We took a risk that  sadly did not pay off. The pace was good in my second stint, but we  had already lost a lot of ground by that point. That is a real shame,  but there is plenty of racing left and we will give it our all.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
No. 1 in position no. 1: Nick Yelloly claims pole position in the rain in the ROWE Racing BMW M6 GT3.;Nürburgring. Last year’s winners ROWE Racing lived up to the #1 on the BMW M6 GT3 in Top Qualifying. In difficult conditions on a wet circuit, Nick Yelloly (GBR) claimed pole position for the Nürburgring 24 Hours with a lap time of 10:01.619 minutes. The race will start on Saturday at 15:30. Jesse Krohn (FIN) finished fourth in the Schubert Motorsport #20 BMW M6 GT3, while Max Hesse (GER) was tenth in the #77 BMW M6 GT3 of the BMW Junior Team.;Nürburgring. Last year’s winners ROWE Racing lived up to the    #1 on the BMW M6 GT3 in Top Qualifying. In difficult conditions on a    wet circuit, Nick Yelloly (GBR) claimed pole position for the    Nürburgring 24 Hours with a lap time of 10:01.619 minutes. The race    will start on Saturday at 15:30. Jesse Krohn (FIN) finished fourth    in the Schubert Motorsport #20 BMW M6 GT3, while Max Hesse (GER) was    tenth in the #77 BMW M6 GT3 of the BMW Junior Team. Just before the    start of Top Qualifying, the lap of honour for the BMW M3    ‘Eifelblitz’ in memory of Sabine Schmitz ensured a sensational atmosphere. While the track was still dry, Augusto Farfus (BRA) had  put the BMW Junior Team in a position to battle for the top ten by  recording the third-fastest time in the first part of Top Qualifying,  thereby qualifying for the top 20 shootout. Hesse then held his nerve  as stormy weather led to extremely challenging track  conditions. The session went even better for Yelloly, who  coped best with the conditions to lap more than two seconds faster  than the second-placed car. A strong performance in the individual  time trial put Krohn in third place for some time, but he was still  pleased to finish fourth and secure a spot on the second row of the  grid. The Walkenhorst Motorsport #100 car competing in the  Pro-Am class had also made it into Top Qualifying 2, but chose not to  appear for safety reasons and was classified in 20th position. The  Walkenhorst Motorsport #101 BMW M6 GT3, the #98 BMW M6 GT3 from ROWE  Racing and the Walkenhorst Motorsport #102 BMW M6 GT3 will start the  race from 24th, 25th and 30th positions. Appearance of ‘Eifelblitz’ in memory of Sabine Schmitz evokes    real emotion.The 30 minutes leading up to the first of the two Top Qualifying  sessions were dominated by memories of the recently deceased  Nürburgring legend Sabine Schmitz. Johannes Scheid, who won the  24-hour race together with Schmitz in 1996 and 1997 at the wheel of  the BMW M3 ‘Eifelblitz’, completed a lap of honour around the  Nordschleife in a replica of the winning car from 1996. It started in  the pit lane, accompanied by applause from the other teams and  drivers, who emerged from their pit areas to form a guard of honour  for the ‘Eifelblitz’. “It was very emotional to first see everyone in  the pit lane and then the track marshals along the circuit, who had  even made their own banners,” said Scheid after his lap. “I said to  Sabine: ‘They are all there for you’. It was very moving. It still  gives me a chill just to think about it. We owed it to her and I think  it is fantastic that BMW made it possible.” Reactions to Top Qualifying: Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The  conditions for qualifying today were extremely difficult and we are  very pleased with the BMW performance. Last year’s winners ROWE Racing  and Nick Yelloly in pole position after an outstanding display of  driving, Jesse Krohn in fourth place in the BMW M6 GT3 from Schubert  Motorsport and Max Hesse in the BMW Junior Team car, which Augusto  Farfus got out of Q1 and into Q2, in tenth position – that was a  superb performance. But that is just the beginning. We have a very  long race ahead of us, and it will all be about making a few errors as  possible. Today, the Nordschleife has already shown that you can  always expect unpredictable weather conditions and it will be no  different tomorrow. And you have to consider the strength of the  competition. We have a mature and reliable car in the form of the BMW  M6 GT3, we have very good teams and we have very good drivers.  Together, we will attempt to get the very best out of this. We are  looking forward to this race.“ Nick Yelloly (#1 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 1st place):  “I am very, very happy to bring that pole home for BMW. Obviously  after last year’s event, when we managed to win, to start off like  this is just superb. I couldn’t picture a better start to the weekend.  It was pretty tricky and slippery out there but it worked out. Now  it’s all about focusing for the race. We know that it is going to be  mixed conditions so we have to be very good and on top of our game in  terms of calling the right pit strategy and tyre choice. But the team  were amazing, as were BMW, last year in doing so, so there is no  reason why we can’t do it again.” Jesse Krohn (#20 BMW M6 GT3, Schubert Motorsport, 4th  place): “I am very happy. Obviously starting in the top ten  is quite important in this race and we managed to qualify in the top  five so I can be happy especially as I can’t even remember the last  time I drove here on the wet and many of the other guys drove a lot  here last year so in that sense they had a bit of an advantage. But I  just went to the risk level that I was comfortable with, that I knew I  can do a good job with and not risk the car. Because tomorrow is the  big day, today was just one step to the goal.” Max Hesse (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team, 10th  place): “Mega! That was the first time I had ever driven any  laps in the GT3 car in the rain. From the start, I realised that it  would not be an easy task. But overall, we are of course super happy  with tenth place. It's our first top ten result at our first 24-hour  race in the GT3. A big thank you to Augusto as well;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The new #37 bike in action is the BMW M 1000 RR.;Munich. BMW Motorrad Motorsport and BMW Motorrad World    Endurance Team get the FIM Endurance World Championship 2021 (FIM    EWC) started with a real endurance classic. The season kicks off    with the ‘24 Heures Motos’ on 12th/13th June at Le Mans (FRA). For    Werner Daemen’s team it is their second year in the endurance world    championship after a strong maiden season. The new #37 bike in    action is the BMW M 1000 RR. The regular riders Markus Reiterberger    (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Xavi Forés (ESP), as well as Kenny    Foray (FRA) as the fourth rider make for an experienced, strong    rider line-up. BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team prepared the new M RR for its race  appearances in the FIM EWC with intensive test rides. At the official  Pré-Mans Test at the end of March, the team set the best time with new  record laps with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR on both days and is now eager  to build on that performance at the first race weekend of the season. The FIM EWC 2021 consists of four events in France, Portugal and  Japan. After the opener at Le Mans, the season continues on 17th July  with the 12 Hours of Estoril in Portugal. The 24-hour classic ‘Bol  d’Or’ will be held at Le Castellet (FRA) on 18th/19th September,  before the season draws to a close with the 8-hour race at Suzuka,  Japan on 7th November. Quotes ahead of the Le Mans season opener. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “After the long winter break, the FIM EWC is finally  returning to action. BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team’s maiden season  was a strong one, and with our new BMW M 1000 RR we are now taking the  next step in the endurance world championship as well. The bike has  undergone further optimisations in many areas. In collaboration with  our partner Dunlop, we also spent the break developing some very good  new tyre options. Another very important point is our strong and very  well-oiled rider line-up. We confirmed the potential of our bike as  well as the team and riders in impressive fashion at the Le Mans  pre-test. Now we need to make use of this in the race as well. It goes  without saying that endurance racing, and 24-hour races in particular,  have their own peculiarities. But we and the team have done everything  to make sure we are as well-prepared as possible.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “I think that we are better prepared for Le Mans than last  year, so I’m expecting a good result. We are very happy with the new  BMW M 1000 RR and the pre-test at Le Mans was superb for us. All our  riders are in top form. We are ideally positioned with Ilya, Markus  and Xavi as our regular trio, and I can honestly say that with Kenny  we have the fastest reserve rider in the world. He proved that once  again last weekend, when he finished second in the French  championship. Now the team is working on fine-tuning every detail. I’m  looking forward to the race, and if everything goes according to plan,  we should be up there at the front.” Markus Reiterberger: “I’m delighted that we can  finally race again. We made full preparations at the tests. The whole  team did a fantastic job. We saw that our bike works really well and  always knew the direction in which we needed to make changes. Our  rider line-up is incredibly strong and during the tests we saw that we  are working at a very high level. We were the clear number one at Le  Mans which makes us optimistic. Now, I’m hoping that we can make good  use of the experience we gained from the tests in the race. We are  well-prepared and are aiming to get through the 24 hours safely and  without any errors. Now, it is important to focus on our race pace  once again in the practice sessions and to have good qualifying  sessions. I’m confident and am really looking forward to a fantastic  race weekend at Le Mans.” Xavi Forés: “I am really looking forward to starting  the FIM EWC season at Le Mans. We tested there a couple of times, and  overall it was quite good. All three of us were doing the same fast  lap times under the lap record. This is really important for us and  means that we have a strong and consistent package. If the weather  stays like we want it to, we can definitely fight for the victory.  That has to be the goal and there would be no better way to start the  season and to represent the new BMW M 1000 RR. So we are ready to  start the season.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “After the strong tests at Le Mans  it looks like we are ready for the race. The speed was really  incredible and all of us riders were fast. I will try to continue this  pace and feeling on the race weekend and finish it at the same level.  I am looking forward to the weekend, to great teamwork in BMW Motorrad  World Endurance Team and to bringing BMW to the top.” Kenny Foray: “I am looking forward to Le Mans. I  think everyone is ready to achieve a good result. The new bike, the  BMW M 1000 RR, is really fast and consistent. I will give everything  to support my team as best as I can and I am really happy to be part  of the team.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Close to the racing line: with the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible for 24 hours at the Nürburgring;"It was the venue for spectacular Formula 1 races early on, and since 1970 the legendary Eifel circuit has been the venue for one of the world's most popular endurance races. But also beyond the race weekends, the region around the ""Green Hell"" is a popular destination for motorsport fans and driving enthusiasts.";"Munich. It is a marathon for people and engines. Once  a year, the top stars of touring car and Gran Turismo racing battle it  out for victory at the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring. The atmosphere  at the competition against and around the clock is reminiscent of the  times when Formula 1 races were still held on the Nürburgring's  Nordschleife. As a real spectator magnet - and at least from next year  onwards it will be again - the 24-hour race has already attracted up  to 200,000 spectators to the grandstands as well as to the meadows and  camping areas along the track in the Eifel. Motorsport fans and  driving enthusiasts, however, are captivated by the ""Ring""  all year round. For them, the racing flair around the legendary  Nordschleife and the adjacent Grand Prix circuit opened in 1984 is  simply irresistible, as a 24-hour trip around the Nürburgring in the  MINI John Cooper Works Convertible (fuel consumption combined: 7.4 -  7.1 l/100 km according to WLTP, 7.4 - 7.1 l/100 km according to NEDC";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The first ever BMW iX.;The BMW iX and BMW i4 together mark the next major step in the BMW Group transformation towards a 50% global share of fully-electric vehicle sales in 2030. Therefore it is only logical that both vehicles are launching at the same time.  See here all details on the first ever BMW iX.  For the BMW i4 please refer to the separate communications today on BMW Group Pressclub.;The BMW iX is ready for series production and is due to arrive on the  world’s roads from November 2021. The BMW Group’s new technology  flagship combines locally emission-free driving pleasure, sporting  agility and a compelling operating range with a character profile  dedicated squarely to sustainability. With its trailblazing design and  an interior devoted to luxurious spaciousness, the BMW iX embodies a  fresh new take on the Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) concept. Conceived  from the outset for purely electric mobility, this model is based on a  new toolkit for the future, whose vast potential for innovations in  the areas of automated driving, operation, connectivity and digital  services translates into a premium mobility experience unparalleled in  this segment.The BMW iX will be launched with a choice of two model variants. Both  are equipped with an electric all-wheel-drive system, with combined  output of 385 kW/523 hp in the BMW iX xDrive50 (electric power  consumption combined in the WLTP cycle: 23.0 – 19.8 kWh/100 km  [62 miles];  CO2 emissions: 0 g/km) with a maximum output in excess of  440 kW/600 hp that promises an exceptionally sporty all-electric  driving experience. (The figures relating to motor output and energy  consumption for the BMW iX M60 are predicted values based on the car’s  current stage of development.)Well-balanced driving characteristics.The body structure, design principle and chassis tuning of the  BMW iX are perfectly geared to blending superb ride comfort with  sporty handling characteristics. The aluminium spaceframe construction  and the Carbon Cage’s use of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) in  the roof and at the sides and rear result in an intelligent material  mix that increases rigidity at the same time as minimising weight. The  optimised aerodynamic properties that contribute to the car’s drag  coefficient of just 0.25 also have a positive impact on efficiency and  range. The high-voltage battery located low down in the car’s  underbody lowers the centre of gravity, combining with the even weight  distribution to make handling more nimble. Thanks to its well-balanced  driving characteristics, the BMW iX feels solid and comfortable out on  the road, yet also exudes fleet-footed agility.The standard chassis technology for the BMW iX comprises a  double-wishbone front axle, five-link rear axle, lift-related dampers  and an electric steering system with Servotronic function and a  variable ratio. Two-axle air suspension with electronically controlled  dampers, Integral Active Steering and Sport brakes can all be found on  the options list. As an alternative to the standard 20-inch  light-alloy wheels, there is a choice of 21-inch and 22-inch Air  Performance Wheels. These can be fitted with noise-reduced tyres,  which have a layer of foam on their inner surface to improve acoustic comfort.Electric all-wheel drive and near-actuator wheel slip limitation.The electric all-wheel-drive system in the BMW iX transmits  exactly the right amount of drive torque to the front and rear wheels  in all driving situations. Its intelligent control enables fully  variable power transmission ranging from highly efficient pure  rear-wheel drive through to an all-wheel-drive set-up that maximises traction.The near-actuator wheel slip limitation technology fitted in tandem  with all-wheel drive for the first time brings about a further  improvement in traction and handling stability. Integrated into the  motor management, this system produces very precise and lightning fast  corrective inputs and thereby enables the car to make effortless  progress at all times, even in adverse weather and road conditions.  The BMW iX xDrive50 posts acceleration of 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in  4.6 seconds, while the BMW iX xDrive40 hits the same mark from rest in 6.1 seconds.Highly integrated and efficient drive technology.The fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology fitted in the BMW iX  is centred around a drive unit which brings together the electric  motor, power electronics and transmission within a single housing.  This highly integrated electric drive system topology has a beneficial  effect on both power density and efficiency, at the same time as  making highly economical use of the installation space in the area  between the front and rear axle.Both motors in the BMW iX work according to the principle of an  electrically excited synchronous motor, where the excitation of the  rotor is induced by the feed-in of electrical energy rather than fixed  permanent magnets. This enables them to put their maximum torque  on tap immediately on pulling away and maintain it over an extremely  broad rev band. Combined torque peaks at 630 Nm (464 lb-ft) in the  BMW iX xDrive40 and an even higher 765 Nm (564 lb-ft) in the BMW iX xDrive50.Adaptive and individually regulated recuperation.Adaptive recuperation gives a further boost to the efficiency  and range of the BMW iX. Intelligently connected drive management  means the intensity of the brake energy recuperation during overrun  and active braking can be adapted to the road situation, as detected  by data from the navigation system and the sensors used by the driver  assistance systems. When approaching a junction, for example, the  degree of recuperation can be increased, in order to feed energy back  into the high-voltage battery while harnessing the deceleration effect  at the same time. On the open road, meanwhile, the coasting function  can take over, allowing the car to “freewheel” with no drive power  whenever the driver eases off the accelerator.Adaptive recuperation is the default setting in driving position D.  Alternatively, the driver can choose a high, medium or low Brake  Energy Regeneration setting for all driving situations in the BMW  iDrive menu. The highest recuperation setting is automatically  activated in driving position B, which also produces the  characteristic one-pedal feeling. Information on the energy flow can  be viewed in the control display no matter which driving position is  selected. The Efficiency Trainer offers hints for driving in a very  economical manner, while the range horizon clearly illustrates the  impact of driving style on the high-voltage battery’s charge level.High-voltage battery with the very latest battery cell technology.Fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology also includes a  high-voltage battery with state-of-the-art battery cell technology.  Its volumetric energy density at cell level is up by around 40 per  cent compared to the high-voltage battery in the 2020 BMW i3. The  BMW iX xDrive50 is fitted with a high-voltage battery with a net  energy content of 105.2 kWh (gross energy content: 111.5 kWh), while  the battery unit for the BMW iX xDrive40 has a net energy content of  71 kWh (gross energy content: 76.6 kWh).The standard specification of the BMW iX includes an integrated  heating and cooling system for the cabin, together with its  high-voltage battery and a drive system that operates using an  exceptionally efficient heat pump function. Anticipatory thermal  management enables the high-voltage battery’s operating temperature to  be optimised for quick and efficient charging prior to a scheduled  stop at a fast-charging station.The Combined Charging Unit (CCU) in the BMW iX has been designed  to offer a very high level of charging flexibility. DC power can be  taken on board at a rate of up to 200 kW (BMW iX xDrive50) or 150 kW  (BMW iX xDrive40). This allows the battery’s state of charge to be  increased from 10 to 80 per cent in around 35 minutes in the  BMW iX xDrive50 or 31 minutes in the case of the BMW iX xDrive40. What  is more, range can be increased by up to 150 kilometres (93 miles) for  the BMW iX xDrive50 and over 95 kilometres (59 miles) for the  BMW iX xDrive40 in just ten minutes when they are plugged into a DC  fast-charging station with an initial battery charge of 10 per cent.  BMW iX models in Europe are supplied complete with a BMW Charging  Card, the Flexible Fast Charger offering a charging rate of up to  11 kW and a mode 3 charging cable for public charging stations. The  special tariff system offered by BMW Charging allows electrical power  to be replenished at a very attractive price at both public charging  stations and high-power charging stations.Premiere for the new generation of the BMW iDrive    control/operation system.The new generation of the iDrive display and operating system  making its debut in the BMW iX expands the interaction between driver  and vehicle and turns it into a natural dialogue. It is based on the  new BMW Operating System 8 and was designed with a clear focus on  the touchscreen operation of the BMW Curved Display and on verbal  communication with the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, which has  also undergone an extensive upgrade. The BMW Curved Display is a fully  digital display grouping formed by a 12.3-inch information display and  a control display with a screen diagonal of 14.9 inches housed  together behind a glass surface that is angled towards the driver. The  digital personal assistant now boasts additional capabilities and uses  a new graphic when communicating with the vehicle’s occupants.The new My Modes expand the range of vehicle settings that can be  selected, thereby creating an all-encompassing driving experience.  Remote Software Upgrades and the option of also purchasing vehicle  functions later from the BMW ConnectedDrive Store via Functions on  Demand, then having them installed over the air, keep the vehicle  software “always fresh”. Navigation using the cloud-based system  BMW Maps and Augmented Reality Video in the control display ensures  quick and accurate route planning while also making it easy for the  driver to find their way on the road. The use of 5G mobile technology  for data transmission and the ability to integrate a personal mobile  account into the car using the personal eSIM reinforce the pioneering  status of the BMW iX.Wide variety of driver assistance systems.The new technology toolkit in the BMW iX offers considerable  potential for driving forward the development of automated driving and  parking functions, with the prospect of Level 3 functionality in the  medium term. A new generation of sensors, a new software stack and a  powerful computing platform provide the basis for exceptional  intelligence. Five cameras, five radar sensors and 12 ultrasonic  sensors are used to monitor the vehicle’s surroundings.The BMW iX comes equipped with the most extensive set of standard  driver assistance systems ever seen on a BMW along with a wealth  of innovations. The front collision warning system, for instance, now  detects oncoming traffic when turning left (in countries where  vehicles drive on the right) as well as cyclists and pedestrians when  turning right. Availability of the optional Steering and Lane Control  Assistant has been significantly expanded, while the optional Active  Cruise Control with Stop&Go function offers enhanced situational  distance adjustment. The exit warning function, which alerts to the  presence of cyclists or pedestrians in the surrounding area before the  doors are opened, and the Remote Theft Recorder are both new features.  Also to be found on the standard equipment list for the BMW iX is the  Parking Assistant including Reversing Assist Camera and the Reversing Assistant.Exterior design exuding progressive luxury;" spacious interior    with a feel-good ambience.The pioneering character of the BMW iX also clearly shines  through in its exterior design. The clearly structured, reduced design  language, the body’s imposing styling with muscular SAV proportions  and the precisely crafted details create an aura of progressive  luxury. Standout exterior features include the almost completely  blanked-off BMW kidney grille, whose surface is the product of  innovative manufacturing techniques and incorporates camera and radar sensors.The BMW iX has been rigorously designed from the inside out. Its  interior has been created to provide quality of life and personal  well-being. Vast amounts of room and newly developed seats with  integral head restraints set the tone for the luxurious ambience. The  absence of a centre tunnel creates extra legroom and sufficient space  for storage facilities and a centre console designed in the style of a  high-quality piece of furniture. The control panel with feeler bars  and active haptic input as well as a rocker switch for gear selection  adds some very modern flourishes. Besides the BMW Curved Display, the  hexagonal steering wheel and frameless projector integration for the  optional Head‑Up Display further add to the focused driving  experience. There is a choice of three different trims for customising  the interior.The automatic climate control system in the BMW iX comes with a  nanofibre filter to purify the air and new touchscreen controls. The  system intelligently combines interior ventilation and surface, seat  and steering wheel heating to maximise the occupants’ sense of  well-being. The optional Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound  System with speakers integrated out of sight in the head restraints  and a 4D Audio function using bass shakers in the front seats promises  the ultimate sound experience.In addition to acoustic pedestrian protection, the BMW iX also  features a specially composed drive sound, which adds to the thrill of  the driving experience by providing authentic feedback in response  to accelerator movements and speed. The BMW IconicSounds Electric  function included as standard also allows new sound variants from  a collaboration with film score composer Hans Zimmer to be added  to the acoustic repertoire.Production at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing using purely green    power, monitored raw materials extraction, high proportion of    natural and recycled materials.The BMW iX will be produced at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. Both  the vehicle itself and the battery cells will be manufactured using  green power across the board. The BMW Group procures the cobalt  and lithium required for the high-voltage batteries from controlled  sources in Australia and Morocco and delivers it to the battery cell  manufacturers. The design principle for the electric motors allows the  use of rare earth metals to be avoided in the drive system rotors.  Added to which, the company sources aluminium produced using power  from solar energy plants.A high proportion of secondary aluminium and reused plastic also  contribute to the resource-efficient production of the BMW iX. Its  interior uses FSC-certified wood, leather tanned with olive leaf  extracts and other natural materials. Recycled fishing nets are among  the raw materials used for the floor coverings and mats.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The first-ever BMW i4.;The BMW i4 and BMW iX together mark the next major step in the BMW Group transformation towards a 50% global share of fully-electric vehicle sales in 2030. Therefore it is only logical that both vehicles are launching at the same time.  See here all details on the first-ever BMW i4.  For the BMW iX please refer to the separate communications on BMW Group Pressclub;Deliveries will start in autumn 2021.The first-ever BMW i4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Today marks the start of the rollout of the  new BMW Remote Software Upgrade for 1.3 million vehicles with BMW  Operating System 7. This activates Amazon Alexa integration in four  more markets. The upgrade also includes improvements, such as the  integration of the traditional destination entry in BMW Maps. Amazon Alexa integration for four more countries.The upcoming BMW Remote Software Upgrade will update the BMW    Operating System 7 to Version 21-03. The  rollout in Germany will start on June 1st 2021, gradually covering  more BMW Connected Drive markets worldwide. In total, more than 1.3  million BMW vehicles (and more than 20 models) will be given the upgrade.Customers can now also use many of the Alexa  features in their car they know and love at home: add items  to shopping lists, check the news, play music or control compatible  smart home devices from the car. So far, Alexa has been available for  BMW Operating System 7 vehicles in Germany, Austria, Great Britain,  Spain and Italy. This upgrade adds four more countries to the list -  France, the USA, Canada and Brazil. BMW Maps developers also bring back traditional search mask. The BMW Maps navigation system was rolled out in mid 2020 for  vehicles with BMW Operating System 7. The system, cloud-based for the  first time, makes route calculation significantly faster and more  dynamic by combining real-time information with predictive models. The  cloud also contains additional context-related information on now over  120 million points of interest, such as ratings, opening hours and  images. The POI database is updated and kept up-to-date several times  a week at short and regular intervals.The easiest way to enter the destination is in natural language in  dialogue with the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. With BMW Maps,  additional improvements in terms of ease of use via touch or BMW  controller have been implemented. The One-Box Search was used for the  first time, for example. This allows customers to search for the  addresses and names of places, as they are used to with when entering  text in web search engines. Algorithms are used to filter the  applicable database to display the probable suggestions already during  input (auto-completion).Many BMW customers also want the familiar screen mask for destination  entry (country, place, street, house number) back. BMW always has the  aim of offering its customers the best possible customer experience.  According to a decision by product management and the developers, the  traditional search was redeveloped in BMW Maps and is now available to  customers in addition to the one-box search.The adaptation for BMW Maps is activated after installing the current  BMW Remote Software Upgrade. Further improvements of functionsOne of the improvements provided by this upgrade is that the    Lane Departure Warningsettings can now be saved  permanently. If customers do not wish to benefit from the  lane departure warning, they can disable the function in the settings.  From now on, the deactivation remains stored in the corresponding,  activated BMW ID. The function is only reactivated if the customer  makes the corresponding change in the settings.Another improvement that comes with this update of the BMW Operating  System corrects a display error when playing media with    Android smartphones paired via Bluetooth (with  Android 11). After the upgrade, the cover art is  processed correctly when music tracks are changed.In some vehicle models with BMW Operating System 7 the    Surround View on the control display was not  positioned correctly. This has also been corrected as part of the  quality improvements. General notes on the BMW Remote Software Upgrade and on the rollout.With BMW Operating System 7 and BMW Remote Software Upgrade, it has  been possible since 2018 for BMW drivers to keep their vehicle  up-to-date with the latest software easily and quickly. The new  functions can be conveniently installed in the car over the air. The  installation files are prepared in the vehicle in the background.  After that, even the installation of extensive upgrades will rarely  take more than 20 minutes.Due to the Corona situation - with its impact on support capacities -  the rollout of the current upgrade may be delayed in individual markets.Vehicles with BMW Operating System 7 not produced before March 2021  already have the latest software version.Customers are informed about available Remote Software Upgrade via  the My BMW App or on the control display in the vehicle. In addition,  the software status can be viewed in the vehicle settings under Remote  Software Upgrade and a search for available upgrades can be carried  out. Remote Software Upgrade is now available for more than 20 BMW  models and thus almost for the entire BMW fleet. Vehicles with  software versions older than 20-07 can only install the latest version  after downloading and installing the intermediate versions. Only the  next possible upgrade is offered for installation in the vehicle. The  customer can never install a wrong version.  Notes:The availability of services and functions depends on the vehicle  model, the corresponding equipment and the respective country.  Customers can view the Release Notes applicable in the respective  market on the BMW national site.You can find instructions and tips on BMW Remote Software Upgrade in  the corresponding BMW How-To videos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They are challenging for race wins and titles with the BMW M6  GT3, the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW M2 CS Racing, and other BMW M Motorsport  race cars. Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you a regular  overview of the race action in various championships around the world  and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. Throughout the  year, we also highlight certain topics in specific press releases. --Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe: Walkenhorst Motorsport’s    battle for the podium remains unrewarded. The second endurance race of the season in the Fanatec GT World  Challenge Europe powered by AWS took place last weekend. The six-hour,  1000-kilometre race was hosted by the “Circuit Paul Ricard” in Le  Castellet (FRA). The Walkenhorst Motorsport team was battling for a  podium finish with both BMW M6 GT3s, but their strong performances  went unrewarded in the end. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco  Wittmann (GER) and David Pittard (GBR) were at the wheel of the #34  BMW M6 GT3. Martin Tomczyk, Timo Glock (both GER) and Thomas Neubauer  (FRA) shared driving duties in the #35 car. Starting from fifth and 13th on the grid, Pittard and Tomczyk were  both able to put the BMW M6 GT3s on course for the podium early on as  they moved into second and third places. The #35 fell back later on,  while Wittmann and van der Linde kept the #34 in the top three until  the final hour of the race, battling for the lead after a full-course  yellow phase. However, a collision with another car around 50 minutes  before the end meant that they lost time during repairs and also  dropped down through the field. After six hours of racing, the #34 BMW  M6 GT3 crossed the line in eighth place, with the #35 car right behind  in ninth position. The Boutsen Ginion Racing team finished seventh in the Pro-Am class  with the #10 BMW M6 GT3. The car was driven by Karim Ojjeh (KSA), Jens  Liebhauser and Jens Klingmann (both GER). The next endurance race in the series is the 24 Hours of  Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) on 31st July/1st August. Reactions to the race at Paul Ricard. Sheldon van der Linde: “It was a very good weekend  for us and positive in terms of raw pace and speed from Friday  onwards. We always had a good car from the first free practice on. In  the race, David and Marco did a great job, and we were always in the  top-three. Then the car seemed to have lost some pace, but I defended  second place as long as I could. At the end of my first stint I had a  very light contact, which was just enough to lift the bonnet up. So we  had to box a bit earlier for our mandatory pit stop for tyres and  fuel, and obviously I had to wait a bit longer to repair the bonnet.  That kind of destroyed our hopes for the podium. But we were still  able to score some points and it’s a very good pace to build on for  Spa. Walkenhorst Motorsport have shown in the past that they are able  to win that race, so I think we have a strong package to go there, and  that gives me a lot of confidence.” Marco Wittmann: “Of course, it’s a disappointing way  for it to end, when you’ve been on track for a podium finish for the  whole race and then fall back to eighth after a collision like that 50  minutes before the end. Nonetheless our pace was good for the whole  weekend, which allows us to be optimistic about the 24h hour race in  Spa. We can build on that. We will definitely not bury our heads in  the sand and will come back stronger.” Martin Tomczyk: “Starting from 13th on the grid was  not ideal, but overall we were pretty confident about our race  performance. I did the first two stints and moved up from 13th to  second place. Unfortunately, we then started to encounter some  problems. Thomas Neubauer struggled a bit with the setup, but was able  to consistently hold on to fifth place. The door latch unfortunately  stopped working during the changeover to Timo Glock and he had to make  an extra pit stop for us to fix the door. Of course, that cost us more  time and we fell back after that. It didn’t finish as we had expected,  as our racing pace was definitely better than the result itself.  However, we are still confident that there will be a race in which our  form will be reflected in the result it deserves. But that is racing.” Timo Glock: “As far as I’m concerned, Martin produced  the performance of the race, driving a crazy opening double stint to  move the car up from 13th to second place. He did a super job. Thomas  was also consistently in the top five. However, the door did not close  properly when I got in during the pit stop, so we had to come back  into the pits during a full-course yellow, and that cost us a bit of  time. But I had problems in my first stint with no balance and no grip  on the tyres. I don’t know what caused that. My second stint was then  a bit better. I was satisfied with my qualifying performance over one  lap, but I still have to learn about the race distance. Thanks to the  team for doing such a great job without any errors over the whole  weekend. I had a lot of fun.” --IMSA series: Another record win for Bill Auberlen in Mid-Ohio. Tumultuous celebrations in the Turner Motorsport team: Bill Auberlen  and Robby Foley (both USA) proved unbeatable in the #96 BMW M6 GT3 at  the third race of the season in the 2021 IMSA WeatherTech Sports Car  Championship (IMSA series) in Mid-Ohio (USA). They celebrated victory  in the GTD class after 2 hours and 40 minutes of racing. This enabled  Auberlen to improve his impressive, unique record in the IMSA series  as he recorded his 63rd win. Foley had moved up quickly to second  place from the start and then took the lead after an early pit stop.  After 69 laps he handed over to Auberlen, who claimed victory by  crossing the finishing line nearly three seconds clear after 111 laps.  “The BMW M6 GT3 is back where it belongs – in the winner’s circle,”  stated Auberlen. “We had some bad luck in the last race at Sebring,  but Robby and I are back in the points and we’re moving forward.” One day earlier Turner Motorsport had secured fifth place in the  Mid-Ohio race in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge with the #96 BMW M4  GT4, driven by Foley and Vincent Barletta (USA). Auberlen and Dillon  Machavern (USA) suffered some bad luck in the #95 car: they were  struck by a rival car and had to retire early. --ADAC GT Masters: Schubert Motorsport starts the season with a podium. The season-opener in the ADAC GT Masters took place in Oschersleben  (GER) in mid-May – and the Schubert Motorsport team celebrated a  podium result in its home race. After just missing out on the podium  with a fourth-place finish in Saturday's race, Nick Yelloly (GBR) and  Jesse Krohn (FIN) secured second place on Sunday in the #10 BMW M6  GT3. The weekend was dominated by changeable and tricky weather  conditions. Strategy became the key to success as rain alternated with  dry periods. Schubert Motorsport got it absolutely right. After second  place in Sunday’s race, Yelloly commented: “The race was very  exciting. Switching to slicks was the right decision, although it was  a bit slippery to start with. The team and I are delighted with the  good result and we hope that we can put on another good performance at  the Red Bull Ring.” The second round of the season in the ADAC GT  Masters will take place from 11th to 13th June in Spielberg, Austria. --ADAC GT4 Germany: two races, two wins for Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport. The Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport team could not have made a more  successful start to the 2021 season in the ADAC GT4 Germany. At the  opener, held in mid-May  in Oschersleben (GER), Gabriele Piana (ITA)  and Michael Schrey (GER) claimed first place in both races in their #2  BMW M4 GT4. In race one on Saturday last season’s runners-up started  from pole position and chalked up a start to finish win under  difficult weather conditions. “Winning here is a great feeling.  There’s no better way to start a season. We realised after qualifying  that we have put a superb package together,” said Piana afterwards. In  Sunday’s race Piana and Schrey moved up from fourth on the grid. They  crossed the line in second place but were later classified as winners  after the car ahead of them was disqualified. The win for Piana/Schrey  in Sunday’s race is still a provisional result as the decision is  being appealed. Charlie Martin (GBR) and Sandra van der Sloot (NED) in the Driverse  team’s #12 BMW M4 GT4 also secured third place in the Trophy standings  in Sunday's race. The team is cooperating with Sorg Rennsport in the  ADAC GT4 Germany. --British GT Championship: Century Motorsport celebrates one-two    result with the BMW M4 GT4. The Century Motorsport team enjoyed a perfect season-opener in the  British GT Championship – with pole position and a one-two result in  the GT4 class. The first event of the season took place on 22nd and  23rd May in Brands Hatch (GBR). Gus Burton and Will Burns (both GBR)  showed that they are a force to be reckoned with, recording the best  time in qualifying in the #57 BMW M4 GT4. The pair did not let  multiple safety car phases during the race put them off, celebrating  victory after 73 race laps. Their team-mates, Andrew Gordon-Colebrook  and Chris Salkled (both GBR), completed the success in the #9 BMW M4  GT4, claiming second place in the GT4 class and victory in the Pro-Am  category. “To come away with a one-two is just amazing and a true  reflection of the effort everyone has put in during the off season,”  said Nathan Freke, Century Motorsport Team Manager. “The new EVO BMW  M4 GT4s worked faultlessly and are clearly a force to be reckoned  with. I’d like to thank BMW M Motorsport for the continued support and  to congratulate the drivers on their superb performances all weekend.” --Italian GT Championship: BMW Team Italia starts the endurance    racing season. The first sprint races of the season in the Italian GT Championship  had taken place in early May, and three weeks later BMW Team Italia  was in Pergusa (ITA) to compete in the first endurance race of the  year. The regular drivers in the #7 BMW M6 GT3, Stefano Comandini  (ITA) and Marius Zug (GER), were supported by BMW works driver Bruno  Spengler (CAN) as the team’s third driver. The trio secured pole  position in qualifying on Saturday. However, they were forced to  retire early from the race. Their team-mates, Nicola Neri, Giuseppe  Fascicolo (both ITA) and Alfred Nilsson (SWE), claimed victory in the  GT4 AM class with the #215 BMW M4 GT4. --Super Taikyu: success for BMW Team Studie in Fuji. The Japanese Super Taikyu race series visited Fuji (JPN) from 21st to  23rd May and the 24-hour race at the circuit near Tokyo (JPN) proved  to be extremely successful for BMW Team Studie. In the ST-Z class the  #20 BMW M4 GT4 from SS/YZ Racing with Studie secured an outstanding  second place. Driving duties were shared between Tomohide Yamaguchi,  Seiji Ara, Yuya Sakamoto (all JPN) and João Paulo de Oliveira (BRA).

WorldSBK Sunday in Estoril: three BMW M 1000 RRs in the top ten.;Three BMW M 1000 RRs were among the top nine to cross the line in the second WorldSBK main race at Estoril. Michael van der Mark from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team rode his way up from 14th on the grid to finish sixth on his BMW M 1000 RR. His team-mate, Tom Sykes, finished eighth. Eugene Laverty, competing for the BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse, wrapped up a strong Sunday in ninth place.;Estoril. BMW Motorrad Motorsport rounded off the second race    weekend in the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in    Estoril (POR) with a solid Sunday: three BMW M 1000 RRs were among    the top nine to cross the line in the second main race. Michael van    der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team rode his way up    from 14th on the grid to finish sixth on his BMW M 1000 RR. His    team-mate, Tom Sykes (GBR), finished eighth. Eugene Laverty (IRL),    competing for the BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse, wrapped up a    strong Sunday in ninth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW    satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing retired early from the second race    due to a technical problem. Sykes was the best BMW rider in the morning’s Superpole Race,  claiming seventh place. Starting from 13th on the grid, Laverty leapt  forward from the start and crossed the line in eighth after ten laps.  Van der Mark ended the Superpole Race in 13th, while Folger claimed 18th. In the second race, that featured incidents and falls in the leading  group, the BMW riders produced a consistent and error-free  performance. As had been the case in Saturday’s first race, van der  Mark put on another impressive chasing performance. He started from  14th after the Superpole Race and had already reached the top ten on  the second lap. It did not take long for van der Mark to move up to  seventh place and he was able to secure sixth spot on lap 15 of 21.  Sykes initially fell back from seventh on the grid, but was able to  move up again in the second half of the race. He crossed the finishing  line in eighth. Laverty made another great start from eighth on the grid, moving up  to fifth. Laverty held third place for a short time after Garrett  Gerloff (USA) and Michael Ruben Rinaldi (ITA) retired due to a  collision. He slipped back as the race continued, but finished ninth  to secure his second top ten result of the day. Folger, however, was  forced to end his race on lap three due to a technical problem. The third round of the WorldSBK 2021 will take place from 11th to  13th June in Misano, Italy.  Reactions after race two at Estoril. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Three riders in the top nine – finishing off the race  weekend with this result is certainly something to be pleased about.  It was not an easy weekend. Michael produced a very solid second race  after he was unfortunately unable to improve at all in this morning’s  Superpole Race. Of course, three other riders did take a tumble, but  also under these circumstances it’s all about getting a solid result.  He put on a great chasing performance and it was good to see that all  the BMWs are pretty close to one another. It was a shame that Jonas  had to retire. In general, he had a tough weekend. There are still a  few things to work on, specifically about finding the drive out of the  corners with little grip in these conditions. But I still think that  we did really well. We are satisfied, but now we have to take the next  step towards the podium. And I am confident we can achieve that over  the next three race weekends in Misano, Donington and Assen. On behalf  of the whole of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family I would like to  express my sadness at the death of Jason Dupasquier and send his  family and friends our coldolences. This sad news has overshadowed the  race today.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning’s warm-up was really good: at least I felt good  – I was consistent. Also for the Superpole Race I felt really good,  but in warm-up we had changed the bike a little bit. That was good,  but as soon as the temperatures went up I struggled a little bit. So  the Superpole Race was not that ideal and we even lost two places on  the grid. But anyway, in race two the temperatures were much higher  than yesterday so we gambled to go for the ‘SC X’ tyre, which was the  right choice. The start was a bit messy – I had a good start but in  all three races I was a bit unlucky and could not improve my position  in the first corner. But at the end I was able to go at quite a  consistent pace. I had the chance to follow many riders and I think  our bike has made a huge improvement, especially over a race distance  and when it comes to conserving the tyre. We just need to find a  little bit more drive out of the corners and that should be our next  big step to improve on the bike.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The bike was  much better today than yesterday. We made a small change and really  felt a big improvement on the bike. And again, just struggling, such a  shame when fighting for track position. For whatever reason, at the  moment we lose track positions to some other riders. The BMW M 1000 RR  is certainly strong in some sectors of the track and we are just  getting an understanding why. Unfortunately, I got stuck behind some  other riders and that gave us an issue today with the braking system.  Once I got a clear track, I picked up a lot more speed and found a  much better rhythm. Obviously I am not happy with the result but,  considering where we were yesterday, it’s a big, big improvement. We  definitely learnt a lot on this Sunday afternoon in Estoril and now we  need to keep improving.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “It has been a  bitter-sweet day, because my speed is there and, honestly, this year  the BMW M 1000 RR is such a huge step forward. The Aragón race weekend  was my first proper ride on this new bike, so I am still understanding  how to get the most from it. This weekend, wow, the bike was  fantastic, and in the final race I felt so good to fight with these  guys in the first laps and to get up into third position. But in this  heat I had to take care of the brakes, so I had to let the other  riders’ go and ride in clear air to cool the brakes. Now we will be  100 per cent ready in Misano. These first two rounds have more been  like a test, and from Misano on we will start the season properly.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Unfortunately, also  today did not go as we had hoped. We had a difficult weekend. That  said, things did look a bit better in the final race, even if it did  only last for two laps. But we would have made it into the points if  everything had gone right. Unfortunately, we had a technical problem.  Now we have to look ahead, use the short break and then go back on the  attack in Misano.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Highs and lows for BMW Motorrad Motorsport at Saturday’s WorldSBK race in Estoril.;It was a WorldSBK Saturday of highs and lows for BMW Motorrad Motorsport in Estoril. In race one, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’s Michael van der Mark worked his way up to seventh place with his BMW M 1000 RR. His team-mate Tom Sykes secured 14th position. Jonas Folger (Bonovo MGM Racing) crossed the line in 16th place. Eugene Laverty (RC Squadra Corse) finished 18th, scant reward for the convincing performance he produced in qualifying and during the race.;Estoril. The second round of the 2021 FIM Superbike World    Championship (WorldSBK) season is taking place in Estoril, Portugal.    It was a Saturday of highs and lows for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. In    race one, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’s Michael van der Mark    (NED) worked his way up to seventh place with his BMW M 1000 RR. His    team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) secured 14th position. Jonas Folger (GER)    from BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing crossed the line in 16th    place. Eugene Laverty (IRL) from BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse    finished 18th, scant reward for the convincing performance he    produced in qualifying and during the race. In the morning, Sykes claimed fifth place on the grid in Superpole  qualification. Folger was the second-best BMW rider in 11th place,  followed by van der Mark in 12th. Laverty had finished the session in  eighth place, but was one of many riders whose lap times were annulled  due to yellow-flags. Consequently, the Irishman slipped back to 13th  on the grid. In the race, van der Mark showed a consistent performance and was  able to make gradual progress after starting from 12th. He reached  seventh position by the halfway point of the race and was able to  maintain this until the chequered flag. Team-mate Sykes was in sixth  position right after the start of the race, but the British rider  started to fall back after the second lap. After 21 laps, he crossed  the finishing line in 14th place. Laverty went off like a rocket from 13th on the grid, moving up to  ninth through the first turns. He managed to hold on to seventh place  between laps four and nine, before suffering a fall that put paid to  his hopes of securing a top result. Laverty did return to the track  but had to settle for 18th. Folger lost some places at the start and  was unable to make any progress thereafter, crossing the line in 16th. Reactions after race one at Estoril. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “That  was a mixed day for us, but nonetheless I am very pleased with  Michael’s seventh place. Estoril is always a tricky circuit for us and  we had some lost track time to make up for. It was pretty difficult to  choose between the ‘X’ and ‘SC0’ tyres today. We took the safe option  with both riders. Ultimately, that proved to be the right choice and  we produced a solid race. However, seventh place is, of course, not  what we are aiming for. Tom fell back a very long way. Now we have to  analyse the reasons for this. He lost three or four seconds during the  opening laps. Of course, it is very disappointing to finish 14th, 36  seconds behind the winner. That is definitely not our objective. I was  delighted for Eugene at the start of the race, but unfortunately he  took a tumble when in seventh place. However, the track was relatively  greasy and we saw a few incidents like this. For Jonas, it just was  not his day and he would otherwise have recorded a better result. In  conclusion: It is good to have recorded a solid race and we can build  on this for tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We  lost some valuable track time again this morning, so that was not how  we wanted to start the day. But anyway, in Superpole I felt good;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW M CEO Markus Flasch will experience the challenge posed by the Nordschleife for himself at the wheel of the BMW M2 CS Racing. In the run-up to the race, the focus is on the new BMW M4 GT3 and a very special lap of honour.;Munich. From a BMW M Motorsport perspective, the    49th staging of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER) on    5th/6th June 2021 will be full of highlights,    both on and off the track. After the victory for ROWE Racing last    year, the focus from a sporting point of view is on the mission to    defend the title. Four BMW M Motorsport teams line up in the “Green    Hell” with seven BMW M6 GT3 and a host of top-class BMW works    drivers. They include the BMW Junior Team, which will be making its    24-hour debut in the GT3 class. BMW M CEO Markus Flasch will    experience the challenge posed by the Nordschleife for himself at    the wheel of the BMW M2 CS Racing. In the run-up to the race, the    focus is on the launch of the new BMW M4 GT3 and a very special lap    of honour. On the Wednesday before the 24-hour race, BMW M Motorsport will  unveil the BMW M4 GT3 in the livery, in which it will contest its  first test races over the rest of the year. The car will replace the  BMW M6 GT3 as the top car in the BMW M Motorsport range from 2022. On Friday, ahead of Top Qualifying, a replica of the legendary BMW M3  “Eifelblitz” from 1996, built up by BMW M Motorsport, will do an  honorary lap of the Nordschleife in memory of Sabine Schmitz, who  passed away recently. It will be driven by Johannes Scheid, who won  the 24-hour race alongside Schmitz in 1996 and 1997. In the BMW M2 CS Racing, Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH, will don  his racing helmet and start in the CUP5 class alongside Jörg  Weidinger, Matthias Malmedie and Niki Schelle (all GER). After  intensive preparations within the Nürburgring Endurance Series and the  6-hour qualification race, Flasch will be making his debut in the  endurance classic. In total, roughly 30 BMW cars are registered for  the 24-hour race in eight different classes. Leading the way are the seven BMW M6 GT3 in the top SP9 class, which  will be going all out to defend the title and claim the  21st overall victory for BMW. ROWE Racing fields two cars  and, as last year’s winners, will sport the prestigious number 1 on  one of their cars. The BMW Junior Team, with support from BMW works  driver Augusto Farfus (BRA), will be making its 24-hour debut in the  top class in a BMW M6 GT3 run by BMW Team RMG. Schubert Motorsport  lines up with one BMW M6 GT3, while Walkenhorst Motorsport takes to  the grid with three BMW M6 GT3. Quotes ahead of the Nürburgring 24 Hours: Markus Flasch (CEO of BMW M GmbH): “What a fantastic  week we have ahead of us! BMW M Motorsport has a programme littered  with highlights, both on and off the racetrack, underlining, as ever,  how important motorsport is to the BMW brand. With an impressive  contingent here at the Nürburgring, BMW M Motorsport is showing that  it is alive and kicking in the present. That will remain the case in  the future. A symbol of that future is the official presentation of  our new GT icon, the BMW M4 GT3, which will conquer the racetracks of  this world from 2022. From a sporting perspective, we are very much  looking forward to challenging for overall victory with the BMW M6 GT3  in its farewell season, and hopefully to defending the title that ROWE  Racing won in 2020. A particular focus will be on the debut of the BMW  Junior Team in the GT3 category. Our new entry-level car, the BMW M2  CS Racing will line up in the CUP5 class at the endurance classic for  the first time, and I am looking forward to having the opportunity  myself to take part in the race alongside my fantastic team-mates.  Johannes Scheid’s lap of honour in the BMW M3 ‘Eifelblitz’, built up  by BMW M Motorsport, in memory of Sabine Schmitz, is sure to be very  emotional. We are honoured to be able to pay tribute to her with this  legendary car.” Hans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal ROWE Racing): “We  are very proud to come into the race as defending champion. Lining up  with the number 1 on the car is very special. The memories of our  victory in 2020 are still very fresh. We obviously have ambitions of  being out in front again this year, although we know that this is an  ambitious goal. However, we are a very well-rehearsed team with an  enormous amount of team spirit and we will take our opportunity,  should it come our way. I am particularly pleased that we will have  fans back at the circuit this year for this remarkable race.” Stefan Reinhold (Team Principal BMW Team RMG): “This  is a very special race for me personally and my team. During our time  in the DTM, we always tried to get involved in the 24-hour race.  Unfortunately, however, it never worked out. Now the wait is finally  over, and we are all really excited about our home race. Our approach  in the collaboration with the BMW Junior Team has always been to be  just as professional as in the DTM. As such, we had high expectations  of the boys, but they totally lived up to them. Their lap times are  all very good. It was important for us to see that, and gives us  another boost ahead of the race. With his experience and speed,  Augusto is extremely important to the whole team. He is one of the  fastest drivers on the Nordschleife, and knows the processes and the  BMW M6 GT3 extremely well. As such, he is not only a great help to the  Juniors, but to everyone in the team.” Torsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert  Motorsport): “It is nice to be back at the 24-hour race with  the BMW M6 GT3 after two years away. Unfortunately, we have not had  the good fortune you need to convert our speed into top results in our  previous outings. As such, we are really hoping we can bid farewell to  the BMW M6 GT3 with a good result this time. We have drivers who know  the Nordschleife very well and we have already worked together with  the majority of them on numerous occasions. After finishing on the  podium at the recent season-opener in the ADAC GT Masters in  Oschersleben, we arrive at the Nürburgring full of motivation and optimism.” Niclas Königbauer (Team Manager Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “We are delighted to be fielding four cars in  this year’s 24-hour race. We are very happy with the drivers in our  three BMW M6 GT3 and are confident that we can really make a mark on  the race with them. We are also represented with a BMW M4 GT4. We hope  the weather gods are kinder to us than they were last year. If so, we  will certainly have a very exciting race ahead of us.” The key driver line-ups at a glance. ROWE Racing, #1 BMW M6 GT3:Nick Catsburg (NED)John Edwards (USA)Philipp Eng (AUT)Nick Yelloly (GBR) ROWE Racing, #98 BMW M6 GT3:Connor De Phillippi (USA)Martin Tomczyk (GER)Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)Marco Wittmann (GER) Schubert Motorsport, #20 BMW M6 GT3:Jesse Krohn (FIN)Jens Klingmann (GER)Alexander Sims (GBR)Stef Dusseldorp (NED) BMW Junior Team, #77 BMW M6 GT3:Dan Harper (GBR)Max Hesse (GER)Neil Verhagen (USA)Augusto Farfus (BRA) Walkenhorst Motorsport, #100 BMW M6 GT3:Henry Walkenhorst (GER)Friedrich von Bohlen (GER)Jörg Breuer (GER)Andreas Ziegler (GER) Walkenhorst Motorsport, #101 BMW M6 GT3:Christian Krognes (NOR)David Pittard (GBR)Ben Tuck (GBR)Jörg Müller (GER) Walkenhorst Motorsport, #102 BMW M6 GT3:Mario von Bohlen (GER)Sami-Matti Trogen (FIN)Jörg Müller (GER)Jakub Giermaziak (POL) Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive, #241 BMW M2 CS Racing:Markus Flasch (AUT)Matthias Malmedie (GER)Jörg Weidinger (GER)Niki Schelle (GER) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"BMW Art & Culture will exhibit ""The Pigment Change"" by Almudena Romero, tenth winner of the BMW Residency, at Rencontres d'Arles.";This year, BMW is celebrating 50 years of supporting cultural projects all over the world, in the fields of modern and contemporary art, jazz and classical music, and architecture and design.

In France, BMW Group France has been a patron of photography since 2003.;"This year, BMW is celebrating 50 years of supporting cultural  projects all over the world, in the fields of modern and contemporary  art, jazz and classical music, and architecture and design. As such,  it contributes to the dissemination of knowledge and the arts. In  France, BMW Group France has been a patron of photography since 2003.""The Pigment Change"" project created during the BMW  Residency.""The Pigment Change"" takes an  experimental and scientific approach towards natural photo production,  whereby Romero's research focuses on pigment changes, with an  ecological and societal commitment. Her work echoes BMW Group's vision  of innovation for a more sustainable future and of production which  respects the environment and its resources.François Cheval, Artistic Director of the BMW Residency, commented on  the winner's work: ""Almudena Romero, like many of her peers,    believes that renewing the medium can follow the same path as the    first photographic processes, while highlighting the plastic and    physical characteristics of plants. Because plants are not only the    subject, they also take on a new status as vectors of visual    information. They are given the new role of determining the final    form of the work of art and specifying its meaning.""Given the inevitable disappearance of the silver process, the  photographer seeks a virtuous practice using living materials. Her  main medium is natural, at the expense of chemistry, plants and her  material, as well as light specific to plants and photosynthesis.The project is divided into four parts: Faire une photographie (take  a photo), Family album, Offspring and The act of producing, which  represent the artist's viewpoint on production or the cause of existence.In ""Faire une photographie"", the plants  are exposed to specific amounts of light to bring about a pigment  change in the leaves, in spring and in fall.In ""Family album"", Almudena exposes the  negatives of her family archives directly onto cress cultivation  panels to ""grow"" photographic prints.In ""The act of producing"" and  ""Offspring"", the photographer uses entire  plants as photographic substrates on which she records her images.""The act of producing"" features various  large-scale collages (1.5 x 2 m) made up of several leaves exposed to  extraordinary quantities of UV light to bring about a pigment change.  This pigment change, based on plants' survival mechanism, involves  replacing the chlorophyll pigments (green) with carotenoids (yellow)  to release excess energy. The artist uses the plants' ability to  change pigments to record very detailed images of her own hands while  working with the plants.In ""Offspring"", the artist uses plants'  selective reproduction strategies as a metaphor to express her  decision not to become a mother due to the current climate and  environment crisis. This part of the project includes a 30-day  timelapse documenting the birth of a new leaf and a series of text  elements printed directly onto the leaves of this plant.The artist was able to broaden her research thanks to the resources  available at the BMW Residency at the GOBELINS School of Visual Arts.  As such, she experimented with complex, fragile, expensive and  large-size materials within the school environment, assisted by two  students and supported by professors. EXHIBITIONS.""The Pigment Change""  created as part of the BMW Residency will be exhibited:BOOK.""The Pigment Change"" has been  jointly published by BMW Art & Culture and Les éditions de l'air,  des livres.This original editorial choice supports the research and  experimentation dimension of the BMW Residency at the GOBELINS School  of Visual Arts.This edition is made up of three different-sized bound booklets,  inserted into a horizontal strip.

Hydrogen as a key future technology; BMW Group Plant Leipzig hosts Central German Hydrogen Summit  Fourth hydrogen fuel station opens at Plant Leipzig  Envisioning a green plant with fully decarbonised production ;Leipzig. The BMW Group has clear goals for effective  climate protection and sustainable mobility up to the year 2030 – and  products and production are affected.“Our solution to the challenges of environmental policy is  technological innovation. Technology is where the key to the future  lies – and it’s our constructive response for climate protection,”  said Hans-Peter Kemser, Director of BMW Group Plant Leipzig. As a  green plant, Leipzig aims not only to be carbon-neutral but also to  operate carbon-free production. “Our vision is to fully decarbonise  production by replacing fossil fuels with future fuels in the shape of  green hydrogen,” he added.And that’s why Hans-Peter Kemser was all the more delighted to host  the Central German Hydrogen Summit, which took place at BMW Group  Plant Leipzig today. In attendance were Michael Kretschmer, Minister  President of the Free State of Saxony, Dr. Reiner Haseloff, Minister  President of the state of Sachsen-Anhalt, Henry Graichen, County  Commissioner of the Leipzig District, Kai Emanuel, County Commissioner  of Nordsachsen, Burkhard Jung, Lord Mayor of Leipzig, and Egbert  Geier, Mayor of Halle, along with numerous guests from business,  politics, administration and academia taking part in discussions at  the plant. The event was streamed live, with speakers exploring  application and investment plans as well as the establishment by 2030  of a full-coverage hydrogen infrastructure for the Halle and Leipzig region.In his welcome speech, Hans-Peter Kemser listed the three main  challenges of using green hydrogen: how to ensure sufficient supplies  for the plant, which technologies exist or need developing to enable  the use of hydrogen, and how to remain profitable despite the current  high cost of green hydrogen. All three points are currently being  investigated and assessed with partners from politics and business.In a first step, hydrogen is already being used in logistics to power  tractors and forklifts carrying required parts to the assembly  lines. The first such vehicles went into service back in 2013, and  Plant Leipzig now operates 81 in total. With a further 37 to be added  shortly, Plant Leipzig will have the largest hydrogen-powered  logistics fleet in Germany. Like conventionally powered vehicles, the  hydrogen fleet has the great advantage of being very quick to refuel –  and the filling stations take up little space.The Hydrogen Summit also provided the backdrop for BMW Group Plant  Leipzig to inaugurate its fourth on-site hydrogen filling station. The  first went on stream in 2013 in the BMW i bodyshop and was the only  indoor H2 refuelling station in Germany at the time. Two  more followed in 2018, and a fourth is now also set to supply the  steadily rising number of hydrogen vehicles. About 50 kg of hydrogen  are put into their tanks every day – all of it certified green since  day one.BMW Group Plant Leipzig has always been planned as a “green plant”  and has set standards in sustainability in many areas, from production  of the electric BMW i3 and BMW i8 to the site’s four wind turbines and  battery farm, and the hydrogen-powered vehicles operating in  intralogistics. A holistic approach to advancing sustainability has  been the goal throughout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Starting in July 2021, the driver assistance system Lane Departure    Warning will contribute more than ever towards an increase in    comfort and safety in many BMW models thanks to a functionality that    is even more precisely aligned to each driving situation.  At speeds    exceeding 70 km/h, the camera-based system helps the driver avoid    unintentional lane change. In respective situations, the driver is    warned by means of steering wheel vibration. Furthermore, a steering    impulse helps the driver direct the vehicle back into the correct    lane position. In future, on narrow country roads with a lane width    of less than 2.60 metres and without a central lane marking, this    steering impulse will be overriden. In the case of oncoming traffic,    use of the outer edge of the lane will then be possible without any    loss in comfort. The latest version of the Lane Departure Warning feature is    available for all model variants of the BMW 3 Series, BMW 4 Series,    BMW 5 Series, BMW 6 Series, BMW 7 Series and BMW 8 Series as well as    the BMW X5, the BMW X6, the BMW X7, the BMW M3, the BMW M4, the BMW    M5 and the BMW M8.

Behind the scenes of BMW Motorrad Motorsport: An interview with Eugene Laverty in Portugal in advance to first Portuguese WorldSBK round 2021 in Estoril.;Ahead of the first Portuguese round of the 2021 WorldSBK season, we took the opportunity to conduct an interview with Eugene Laverty and his wife Pippa and visited them at their property near Portimão. In the conversation, both give a very personal insight into their new life in Portugal and describe the sunny and dark sides of the dynamic motorsport world.;Estoril. Next Thursday, 3rd June, Eugene Laverty (IRL) celebrates his 35th birthday. He    has been following a family tradition since childhood and is one of    the most experienced riders in current motorcycle racing. The    Irishman has been riding for BMW Motorrad in the FIM Superbike World    Championship (WorldSBK) since 2020. After his debut season in the    BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Laverty is deployed for the Italian BMW    satellite team RC Squadra Corse in 2021. Furthermore, in his role as    a BMW test rider, Laverty is helping to advance the further    development in the supersport-segment bikes of BMW Motorrad. At the end of 2019, Laverty and his wife Philippa ‘Pippa’ Laverty  moved to Portugal. Ahead of the first Portuguese round of the 2021  WorldSBK season, we took the opportunity to conduct an interview with  the ‘Portuguese by choice’ pair and visited them at their property  near Portimão. In the conversation, both give a very personal insight  into their new life in Portugal and describe the sunny and dark sides  of the dynamic motorsport world. Living in Portugal.  After the first race in Spain, Portugal is the next country in    the WorldSBK calendar, a kind of ‘home race’ for you. How did you    come up with the idea of moving to Portugal? Eugene: “In a way Portugal has always been like a  second home to us after my first years in World Supersport. I was with  the Parkalgar Honda Team, which is the team that was formed when the  Portimão circuit was built. So I spent a lot of time here and felt in  some way Portuguese and I always liked it here. So after seven years  in Monaco we started to search around; I am not going to lie, it’s pretty fun.” Eugene: “Yes, we had things good for let’s say 13  years and then unfortunately there was a period where I went through a  lot of injuries, so in Thailand when we had to stay two weeks with  Pippa sitting beside my bed in hospital and then when I broke both my  wrists, that was tough as well where I needed Pippa for more things  than I would like to say because I wasn’t able to do anything. There  are some plus sides but those were the tough times as well.” Pippa: “Yes, you could go from literally drinking  champagne and party with friends one week and being by a hospital bed  the next;" it’s a really up and down sort lifestyle. You need to be  prepared for that.” Did our own podcast ‘Champain’ come out of that? Pippa: “Yes, the idea for my podcast ‘Champain’ is  that I wanted to highlight the good and the bad times of the people  who support the athletes as well as the athletes themselves, what they  learn from it and where it has got them in their lives. Because I  don’t think you really learn how to go through hard times. The podcast  sort of highlights how throughout life you can have tough times and  how you deal with those tough times. There’s no bubbles without some  troubles, that’s my caption for ‘Champain’. And to be a champion you  have to go through some pain, you have to sacrifice a lot, you have to  dedicate a lot and you have to ... you know, it’s not easy. I think  people look on social media or on the TV think oh wow, it must be so  fun to be a race car driver or this or that, I don’t think people  realise the lot of sweat and tears that people put in to get to where  they are. And that’s what the podcast is kind of about.” Eugene: “From the riders’ side it is great and I  really get quite angry when I hear some professional riders almost  complaining how difficult the lifestyle is. It’s got tough times but I  think we are very fortunate to be in the position that we are in.  There are the tough days but things change and in the past, there have  been a lot of tough days but it’s worth it then whenever you get the  good days.” """;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

E-drive train production for the fully-electric models BMW iX and BMW i4 begins;BMW Group continues to expand manufacturing capacity at the Competence Centre for E-Drive Production in Dingolfing  E-drive trains for 500,000 electrified vehicles per year from 2022  Extensive in-house drive train expertise: Start of production for fifth-generation high-voltage batteries in Germany  Successful transformation to e-drive train production ; Munich/Dingolfing. Production of fifth-generation  high-voltage batteries and battery modules for use in the BMW iX* and  BMW i4 is now underway at the Competence Centre for E-Drive Production  in Dingolfing. At the same time, the company is also increasing  production capacity for its fifth-generation electric motor, which has  been built in Dingolfing for the BMW iX3* since 2020 and will also  power the BMW iX* and BMW i4. “We expect at least 50 percent of the  vehicles we deliver to our customers worldwide to be electrified by  2030. To achieve this, we are relying on our extensive in-house drive  train expertise: We are increasing capacity at existing drive train  production locations – like here in Dingolfing – and developing  capabilities at others – like recently in Regensburg and Leipzig,”  explained Dr Michael Nikolaides, Senior Vice President, Production  Engines and E-Drives, BMW Group.The BMW Group is investing more than 500 million euros in expanding  production capacity for e-drives at its Dingolfing location alone  between 2020 and 2022. From 2022, it will produce e-drives for more  than half a million electrified vehicles. The BMW Group will invest a  total of around 790 million euros in expanding capacity for electric  powertrain components at its Dingolfing, Leipzig, Regensburg and Steyr  locations between 2020 and 2022.Standard production of the BMW iX* will soon get underway at BMW  Group Plant Dingolfing, followed by production of the BMW i4 at Plant  Munich in the autumn. The highly integrated e-drives and high-voltage  batteries for these vehicles will all be manufactured at the  Competence Centre for E-Drive Production in Dingolfing. The BMW Group  already began producing battery components at Plants Regensburg and  Leipzig in April and May 2021. In line with growing demand for  e-drives, BMW Group Plants Landshut and Steyr are also stepping up  production of e-drive housings. Production of fifth-generation BMW eDrive technologyThe output and energy content of drive units and high-voltage  batteries with fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology can be flexibly  scaled. This means they can be optimally adjusted to suit different  model variants.Each vehicle uses up to two highly integrated e-drives, which combine  the electric motor, power electronics and transmission in a single  housing. Based on the design principle of a current-excited rotor, the  fifth-generation e-drive does not require any materials classified as  rare-earth metals.BMW eDrive technology also comprises a high-voltage battery with  state-of-the-art battery cell technology. The BMW Group agreed with  its suppliers that they will only use renewable green power for  producing fifth-generation battery cells. The entire high-voltage  battery boasts outstanding qualities in the areas of performance,  charging and discharging characteristics, durability and safety. The  technically standardised production process for battery modules has  been further developed in such a way that different module variants  can be produced on the same production line – in line with the growing  range of electrified vehicle models and performance levels. The  production systems are highly flexible and scalable. Battery modules  are produced from supplied prismatic battery cells at the respective  BMW Group production location. A modular system developed in-house  allows model-specific high-voltage batteries to be manufactured from  these modules in a flexible arrangement.The company has outstanding expertise and experience, both in the  field of battery cell technology and in production of model-specific  high-voltage batteries. The BMW Group conducts basic research in the  fields of cell chemistry and cell design at its own Battery Cell  Competence Centre. The BMW Group also produces battery cell prototypes  itself. These battery cell prototypes are used in tests to validate  the development maturity of battery cells and to demonstrate the  effectiveness of the production processes. In addition, the prototype  production of the battery cells serves the identification of process  potentials as well as the optimization of the production processes. In  this way, the BMW Group gains a thorough understanding of the entire  battery cell value chain and the decisive competitive advantages its  chemical and technical properties offer. This enables battery cells to  be manufactured to precise specifications that are geared towards each  vehicle’s individual requirements. Competence Centre for E-Drive ProductionFollowing extensive expansion, the Competence Centre for E-Drive  Production now provides a usable area of 125,000 sq. m. This is where  the company manufactures electric motors and the components needed for  them, as well as high-voltage batteries and battery modules. A paint  coating is also applied to the battery cells at this location. The  coating increases mechanical robustness and thermal conductivity,  thereby improving insulation and cooling of the even more powerful  fifth-generation battery cells.Plant Dingolfing has been manufacturing standard high-voltage  batteries and battery modules since 2013, when the BMW Group's first  all-electric vehicle, the BMW i3*, went into production. The first  production lines for electric motors and high-voltage batteries for  plug-in hybrids went on-stream there in 2014. The Competence Centre  for E-Drive Production has been steadily growing ever since. The plant  has also been producing high-voltage batteries for the fully electric  MINI Cooper SE* since 2019 and, since 2020, also the highly integrated  fifth-generation e-drive used for the first time in the BMW iX3*.  Production of the even more powerful high-voltage batteries for the  BMW iX* and BMW i4 is now getting underway. E-drives for future models  can also be produced on the flexible production lines. Qualification for long-term, sustainable jobsWith the BMW Group systematically pursuing progress in  electromobility, the demands on employees and their areas of  responsibility are also constantly evolving. “We are growing our staff  for e-drive production almost exclusively through personnel  restructuring. We are actively shaping the transformation process and  leveraging our employees’ skills so we can develop long-term  sustainable jobs,” explains Nikolaides.The Competence Centre for E-Drive Production in Dingolfing currently  has almost 1,400 employees. By the end of 2021, around 1,900 employees  are expected to work in e-drive production in Dingolfing.Production employees receive further training at the in-house  learning centre, which uses innovative vocational training and further  education methods to provide employees with intensive preparation for  their new tasks. Employees’ knowledge and skills are being expanded  specifically to include new electromobility technologies, with a  training concept that is constantly updated. The training sessions are  held in the classroom, at practice workstations and directly on the  production lines. Digital methods and augmented reality play a bigger  role here than ever before. Thanks to these methods, the training  courses were also able to continue safely during the coronavirus  pandemic, in compliance with health and safety measures.“The learning centre takes a holistic approach that supports  employees throughout their professional development and further  education, from their first day in production,” reports Dr Sven  Jochmann, head of Production E-Drives Dingolfing, Landshut,  Regensburg, Leipzig. “As well as trainers and managers, new colleagues  are also supported by trained mentors who help them quickly find their  way around their new working environment,” adds Jochmann. Transformation of the Dingolfing locationThe Dingolfing location is a prime example of the successful  transformation of the BMW Group plants towards e-mobility and  digitalisation. E-drive production, including electric motors and  high-voltage batteries, is located in an existing, roughly 50-year-old  building at the site, rather than using new space. The infrastructure  was adapted to the new requirements and expanded accordingly. A modern  staff restaurant seats 300 and there is also a new parking deck with  space for 800 vehicles. The structural measures are rounded out by a  25,000 sq. m. logistics hall, new office spaces and social rooms close  to the production area, as well as an additional plant gate in the  south for improved logistics flows.On the issue of sustainability, the BMW Group takes a holistic  approach to reducing CO2 emissions and minimising resource  consumption that covers the entire value chain, including in-house  production, the supply chain and use phase. In Dingolfing, as at all  BMW Group locations, production uses only green power. In addition,  all BMW Group locations have been net carbon neutral since this year,  through corresponding offsets and certificates. The company is also  using many other levers: from building technology to energy-efficient  installations to increased use of renewable energies. Electric trucks  will be used for intra-company goods transport at the Competence  Centre for E-Drive Production from the autumn. 2030: At least 50 percent of global BMW Group sales will be    fully electric The BMW Group continues its massive electromobility ramp-up: The  company will offer five fully-electric models by the end of this year:  the BMW i3*, the MINI Cooper SE* and the BMW iX3*, as well as the two  main innovation flagships, the BMW iX* and BMW i4.Between now and 2025, the BMW Group will increase its sales of  fully-electric models by an average of well over 50 percent per year –  more than ten times the number of units sold in 2020. Based on its  current market forecast, the company also expects at least 50 percent  of its global sales to come from fully-electric vehicles in 2030. In  total, over the next ten years or so, the BMW Group will be releasing  about ten million fully-electric vehicles onto the roads. Global e-drive production network with a focus in GermanyThe high-voltage batteries and battery components needed for all BMW  and MINI electrified vehicles come from the company’s own battery  factories in Dingolfing, Leipzig and Regensburg in Germany, as well as  from Spartanburg (USA) and Shenyang (China). The BMW Group has also  localised production of high-voltage batteries in Thailand, at its  Rayong plant, and is working with the Dräxlmaier Group for this.  Munich is home to the e-drive pilot plant and the Battery Cell  Competence Centre, where the BMW Group is conducting a full analysis  of battery cell value creation processes and advancing technology for  its production processes.The company produces electric motors at the Competence Centre for  E-Drive Production in Dingolfing and at BMW Group Plant Landshut.

The remaining six sim racers will be determined in  season two of the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup 2021.IMSA iRacing Pro Series.Philipp Eng (AUT) is the new champion in the IMSA iRacing Pro  Series. Third place in the final race at the virtual Road Atlanta  circuit was enough for the BMW works driver to secure the title in the  GTE class. “Winning the title in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series means an  awful lot to me,” said Eng. “I have invested a lot of work and time,  trained a lot, and done an awful lot of set-up work together with BMW  Team BS+COMPETITION. The collaboration was really perfect. For this  reason, I am very happy with this title win.” The race win went to  Agustín Canapino (ARG), who was followed over the finish line by  Rodrigo Pflucker (PER) in second place. As such, the BMW M8 GTE  claimed its third victory in three races. Eng had previously won the  first two races, which were held on the Sebring and Laguna Seca  circuits, to lay the foundation for his title win in the IMSA iRacing  Pro Series, which was held for the second time. In last year’s  inaugural season, Bruno Spengler (CAN) won the title – again in the  BMW M8 GTE. As well as Spengler, the field in season two again  included some big-name drivers – Connor De Phillippi (USA), Augusto  Farfus (BRA), John Edwards (USA) and Robby Foley (USA) – who also  compete in BMW cars in the real IMSA Series.SimGrid Sprint Cup.Title win for BMW Team G2 Esports in the SimGrid Sprint Cup.  Second place at the final round of the championship, which is held on  the Assetto Corsa Competizione platform, was sufficient for drivers  Nils Naujoks, Arthur Kammerer and Gregor Schill (all GER) to wrap up  the title on the virtual Suzuka circuit. Over the course of the  season, the trio in the virtual BMW M6 GT3 had won two races and  claimed a second place. “We honestly did not expect to win the title,  so we are overjoyed that we did. We proved that the BMW M6 GT3 is  capable of winning in the right hands and with a strong team behind  it,” said Naujoks. “At the start of the season, we did not know what  to expect. Gregor has only just joined the team and we were actually  expecting to start as underdogs. Plus, we were also unsure of how the  success ballast system would play out.”V10 R-League.The BMW SIM Racing Team is the new champion in the V10 R-League.  In the Grand Final, Kevin Siggy, Alen Terzic (both SLO) and Michael  Romanidis (GRE) defeated the Aston Martin Cognizant Esports Team 2:1  to win the title for the first time at the second attempt. “We led the  final 2:0, but it then got very close again. Fortunately, I was able  to secure pole position in the all-important final race and just bring  home the win. We have now won the title for BMW SIM Racing – that is  awesome,” said Siggy, who was crowned ‘Driver of the Season’ after the  final. As well as Siggy, Terzic and Romanidis, the BMW SIM Racing Team  also included Felix Quirmbach (GER). The virtual racing series, which is held on the Assetto Corsa  Competizione platform, sees three of the four team members go  head-to-head, taking on the opposition in three different race  formats. The car of choice is a Formula car, which has been developed  specially for this racing series. The rounds leading up to the finale  had already caused great excitement. Having trailed 0:2 in the  quarter-final, the BMW SIM Racing Team launched an impressive  fightback against the Yas Heat team to progress to the semi-final.  Siggy, Romanidis and Terzic then defeated defending champions Team  Redline 3:1 to earn their place in the Grand Final, in which they won  the title. “Our semi-final victory over Redline was actually the  biggest shock,” said Siggy. “Nobody expected that, and it was probably  the key moment on the road to the title.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Personnel changes in BMW Group's global production network;The BMW Group’s production locations in Munich, Oxford and Spartanburg will have new plant directors from 1 September.;Change of management at Plants Munich, Spartanburg and Oxford,  effective 1 September Munich / Oxford / Spartanburg. The BMW Group’s  production locations in Munich, Oxford and Spartanburg will have new  plant directors from 1 September. With the retirement of Knudt Flor  (61), Robert Engelhorn (51) will take over the management of what is  currently the BMW Group’s largest production location, in Spartanburg,  USA, which produces the overwhelming majority of BMW X vehicles. Last  year, despite restrictions due to the pandemic, its production volume  totalled more than 360,000 vehicles. Engelhorn is currently in charge  of the main plant in Munich.He hands over to Peter Weber (49), the current head of Plants Oxford  (MINI) and Swindon (pressings and body components). Weber brings his  expertise from handling the launch of the fully-electric MINI Cooper  SE* to Plant Munich, where the first BMW i4* will come off the  production line this autumn. Markus Grüneisl is moving to the UK to  take over from Weber as the future head of both plants. The  45-year-old is currently responsible for areas including the BMW  production system, process excellence and plant digitalisation at BMW  Group headquarters. “All three are proven experts with extensive process know-how, years  of experience and, not least, excellent leadership qualities.

BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team claims its best team result so far in WorldSBK with the new BMW M 1000 RR.;The new BMW M 1000 RR has demonstrated its potential in the FIM Superbike World Championship. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team claimed its best team result so far at the opening round of the 2021 season at MotorLand Aragón (ESP). Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) ended race two on Sunday afternoon in fourth and fifth places, just one and a half seconds outside the podium positions.;Alcañiz. The new BMW M 1000 RR has demonstrated its potential    in the FIM Superbike World Championship. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK    Team claimed its best team result so far at the opening round of the    2021 season at MotorLand Aragón (ESP). Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael    van der Mark (NED) ended race two on Sunday afternoon in fourth and    fifth places, just one and a half seconds outside the podium    positions. Van der Mark had already impressed with a strong comeback    in the morning’s Superpole race. Jonas Folger (GER) from BMW    satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing finished eighth to round off a    successful Sunday. After enjoying warm and sunny conditions on Friday and Saturday,  Sunday started with rain. The circuit was damp in places at the start  of the Superpole race, but was also drying out in other places making  tyre selection rather tricky. Van der Mark opted for slick tyres, on  which he shot through from 15th on the grid to finish fifth at the end  of the ten-lap sprint race. The Dutchman also set the fastest lap of  the race on his BMW M 1000 RR. Sykes started from third place on the  wet-weather tyre, and was initially running in the top five. However,  he then fell back through the field and returned to the garage on lap  eight as his tenth place on the grid for race two was secure in any case. Conditions were similarly unsettled at the start of race two in the  afternoon. Van der Mark (fifth on the grid) and Sykes (tenth on the  grid) both opted for intermediate tyres. Van der Mark was battling  with the leading group from the word go, and actually briefly took the  lead on lap six. He then spent several laps defending second place  against Jonathan Rea (GBR / Kawasaki). With just a few laps remaining,  Rea and his team-mate Alex Lowes (GBR) managed to find their way past  him. Meanwhile, Sykes was consistently picking his way through the  field and ultimately found himself behind van der Mark. The two  swapped positions on lap 16 of 18, meaning Sykes finished fourth,  ahead of his team-mate in fifth. Folger ended the Superpole race in 13th place, having started 18th.  His big moment came in race two. He and the Bonovo MGM Racing team  opted for slicks. Folger initially had to restrain himself and dropped  down the field. However, he then launched an impressive comeback. On  the final lap, Folger had climbed into sixth place, behind the two  riders from the BMW works team. Shortly before the chequered flag, he  lost two positions due to a small mistake, meaning he crossed the  finish line in eighth place. Eugene Laverty, riding for BMW satellite  team RC Squadra Corse, was 16th in the Superpole race and ended race  two in 17th place. Reactions after race two at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  are very happy. We invested so much work in this project in the  winter, and it was very difficult at the tests to establish exactly  how we really compared to the others. We got off to a difficult start  this weekend, so it is great to be able to turn that around in this  way. Sure they were extraordinary conditions, but it was very pleasing  to see that we were able to challenge the Kawasakis, which are setting  the benchmark, for the full race. There were obviously times in the  race when we would have liked to have finished on the podium, but it  is excellent that we were able to demonstrate with two or even three  bikes that we have the potential to do that. It is a strong result, on  which we can build. We are super happy. The work has paid off, but we  will not stop here – we will continue to work hard.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “A great day. Yesterday it was a struggle in areas, so I was  happy with how we finished the race. Today, I was struggling to see if  we could improve on that, but this morning Michael went out in the  morning’s warm-up in the rain and was immediately fast considering  this was his first ever outing in the wet conditions on the BMW M 1000  RR. In the Superpole race, Michael had a really good run, so to see  him come away with fifth was pleasing as he is learning every day when  he gets on the bike. Tom had an issue with the rear tyre in the  Superpole race so we had to retire but nevertheless we started in P5  and P10 in race two. That race was really exciting, to be battling for  the lead and never out of the top-three, top-four places for most of  the race was great to see. Both BMWs were in the spotlight and it’s  testament to the whole of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team who have  brought this bike through. Heading into Estoril we can be confident we  can be threat for the rest of the season.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “A bittersweet  day, really. We definitely had a Superpole race to forget which we  won’t go into too much detail about. That meant that we compromised  our start position in race two. For race two, I wanted to go with the  slick tyre but after this morning we opted to play it safe on the  intermediates. Overall, after a good start, it was a bit of a waiting  game. I could see what the guys in front of me were doing but  obviously considering the tyres we were on I tried a different  strategy to feel where the BMW M 1000 RR was working and where we had  to improve. Unfortunately, we just missed out on the podium today, but  considering our results here last year it is a huge improvement.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning, we had a wet warm-up session which was my  first time on the BMW M 1000 RR in the rain, and to be honest I had  such a good feeling from the first lap. The Superpole race was in  mixed conditions but I opted to go with the slick tyre and in the end  was the right choice. It did however keep raining at times during the  race which slowed me down in places but anyway it was a good result  for us. This afternoon’s race two again was a gamble on tyre choice,  and I knew I made the wrong choice going up to the start as the track  was drying so quickly. Despite that we made a good start, had some  incredible battles taking the lead but I knew I was asking too much of  the tyres and in the end some guys got past me. But we have got to be  happy with the two P5 positions and most importantly the experience  I’ve gained with the BMW M 1000 RR.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “We are absolutely  happy with eighth place in race two. It is class that we managed this  at the end of what was a difficult weekend. The conditions were very  difficult and we did not know for a long time whether wets or slicks  were the best option. We opted for slicks in the end. Only very few  others made the same decision, including the winner Scott Redding, and  we set the same lap time as Scott. The weather obviously suited us,  but we are very happy. Unfortunately, I went wide in the battle with  Toprak Razgatlioglu at the end of the race, otherwise we could perhaps  have finished sixth. However, eighth place was still the highlight  compared to the rest of the weekend, so we are very happy.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “It was not a good  day, unfortunately. We had some problems in all sessions. For the long  race, I had the wet front tyre and the other riders had intermediates  or slick tyres so there was no chance to move further forward. So it  was really disappointing but I am looking forward to Estoril already.  I said that Aragón and Estoril have been the toughest two tracks for  our bike last year so we have a big challenge but we did a good job  here yesterday during qualifying so that’s reason for optimism. In  Estoril, we need to put our progress on paper because this weekend we  weren’t able to get the results we wanted.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BMW Startup Garage China opens Joint Innovation Base with Alibaba Cloud in Shanghai.; Extension of the BMW Group’s open innovation ecosystem  Joint Innovation Base to provide incubation services to no less than 300 Chinese startups  New collaboration perspectives for international activities of BMW Startup Garage ;Shanghai/Munich. The Joint Innovation Base  (officially named “Alibaba Cloud Innovation Center - BMW Startup  Garage Joint Innovation Base”) started operations yesterday in the  Shanghai Jinqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone. With  this project, BMW and Alibaba will harness their respective strengths  and resources in order to empower Chinese tech startups for scaling up  their innovations. The focus of the startups in the Joint Innovation  Base will be on innovative products, solutions and services bridging  between internet, internet of things (IoT) and the automotive industry.Jochen Goller, President and CEO of BMW Group Region China, said:  “Having become a global innovation power house, China is providing an  ever expanding playing field for start-up companies especially in  science and technology. In this context, BMW Group is also scaling up  its digital footprint in China as well as accelerating our  transformation towards electrification. We will continue to deepen our  collaboration with both established Chinese tech players as well as  skilled new talents to foster their respective strength on innovation.”In three years the Joint Innovation Base will provide no less than  300 companies with advanced cloud computing infrastructure from  Alibaba, access to BMW experts and BMW business units via the BMW  Startup Garage. The BMW Startup Garage aims to scout high-potential  startups to match their innovative solutions with the BMW Group’s  needs. It is positioned as the gateway for startups to the auto  industry linking the BMW Group with cutting-edge outside-in  technologies (more    information on the BMW Startup Garage). More than twenty  startups covering strategic innovation fields such as digitisation,  electrification and sustainability have already set up their office in  the joint incubator.Vehicle innovations in China mainly revolve around digitalization,  smart connectivity, artificial intelligence and automated driving.  “Digital innovation happens at a breath-taking pace in China. Our new  Joint Innovation Base will act as accelerator to further strengthen  our engagement with Chinese top-startups,” said Peter Lehnert, Vice  President New Technologies, Research and Innovation Digital Car.The worldwide search for startups: thinking outside the box.The BMW Group’s technology scouting network has a global reach. The  BMW Startup Garage runs small, agile teams stationed at international  technology hotspots. It now has representatives working at the BMW  Group Technology Offices in Munich, Silicon Valley (Mountain View),  Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore and Tel Aviv. Working closely with  the central development departments in Munich, each individual  location is instrumental in securing early access to trends and  technologies to be able to shape future mobility and bring the best  possible offers to customers.In addition to promoting open innovation in China, BMW also teamed up  with Alibaba to accelerate digital transformation. In October 2020,  the duo signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to carry out  comprehensive cooperation in branding, marketing, channels, end-to-end  operations, services, information technology etc, aiming to implement  the digitalization strategy into BMW China’s full business process,  and enable dealers to provide an end-to-end online-to-offline digital  experience for customers.BMW Group’s R&D footprint in China.Technological innovation and digitalization are the two key fields to  accelerate BMW Group’s business development in China. It is  continuously scaling up investment in R&D in China, accelerating  the transition from “Made in China” to “Create in China”. The BMW  Group has established the largest R&D footprint in China outside  of Germany, including three R&D centres in Beijing, Shanghai and  Shenyang, a dedicated digital company LingYue Digital Information  Technology Co.

Ad-hoc announcement: Partial release of the provision with respect to EU antitrust proceedings;Based on the progress of the proceedings, BMW AG expects, compared with the statement of objections of 5 April 2019, that the EU Commission will significantly reduce its allegations against BMW AG in terms of content and duration.;Munich. Based on the progress of the proceedings, BMW  AG expects, compared with the statement of objections of 5 April 2019,  that the EU Commission will significantly reduce its allegations  against BMW AG in terms of content and duration. The subject matter of the proceedings is whether German automobile  manufacturers cooperated in technical working groups to restrict  competition in the development and rollout of emission-reduction  technologies. The legal conformity of diesel vehicles is not subject  of the proceedings. The BMW Group is not and has not been accused of  unlawful manipulation of emission control systems. On 5 April 2019, BMW AG had recognised a provision of around €1.4  billion. Based on the new information, BMW AG continues to consider it  more likely than not that the EU Commission will issue a fine to BMW  AG. However, the significant limitation in the scope of the  allegations has led to a revaluation of the provision. This  revaluation will result in a positive effect on earnings of around €1  billion in the second quarter of 2021. This effect on earnings is not included in the current guidance for  2021 and will lead to an increase in the EBIT margin for the  Automotive segment of around one percentage point. The current  corridor forecast in this respect will be increased accordingly. The  BMW Group continues to expect a significant increase in Group earnings  before taxes in the current financial year. If the allegations are significantly reduced as expected, BMW AG  would refrain from taking legal action against the issuance of any fine. If you have any questions, please contact: Corporate Communications Michael Rebstock, Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesEmail: michael.rebstock@bmw.de,  Telephone: +49-89-382-20470 Eckhard Wannieck, Head of Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesEmail: eckhard.wannieck@bmw.de, Telephone: +49-89-382-24544 Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail: presse@bmwgroup.com   The BMW Group With its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

BMW Art Journey artist shortlist 2021 announced. Julien Creuzet, Kelvin Kyung Kun Park and Alice Wang nominated.;During this year’s Art Basel in Hong Kong, the BMW Art Journey, a joint initiative of Art Basel and BMW to recognize and support emerging and mid-career artists worldwide, is continued with the announcement of the next shortlist. Like a mobile studio, the BMW Art Journey can take artists almost anywhere in the world to develop new ideas and envision new creative projects. ;Hong Kong. During this year’s Art Basel in Hong Kong,  the BMW Art Journey, a joint initiative of Art Basel and BMW to  recognize and support emerging and mid-career artists worldwide, is  continued with the announcement of the next shortlist. Like a mobile  studio, the BMW Art Journey can take artists almost anywhere in the  world to develop new ideas and envision new creative projects. The  initiative is part of BMW Group’s global cultural engagement  celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Committed in  the fields of modern and contemporary art, classical music, jazz and  sound as well as architecture and design, the BMW Group has been an  integral part of culture on a global scale.Today, the shortlisted artists for the BMW Art Journey 2021 were  announced at the BMW Wanchai Showroom in Hong Kong:Julien Creuzet born in 1986; lives and  works in Seoul; represented by Vanguard Gallery, Shanghai.Alice Wang born in 1983; lives and works in Los  Angeles and Shanghai; represented by Capsule Shanghai.In recognition of the ongoing exceptional circumstances caused by the  pandemic, the international expert jury conducted its selection  process online. Artists and their galleries were invited to submit  digital applications, including a short video by the artists  explaining their work and artistic process. Since 2020, the circle of  eligible artists has broadened and includes not only emerging and  mid-career artists from the Discoveries sector, but also artists  represented by galleries founded no more than ten years ago at Art  Basel’s show in Hong Kong.The shortlisted artists are now invited to develop the proposal for  their ideal journey, with the winner to be announced in summer 2021.Members of the international expert jury are Claire  Hsu, Director, Asia Art  Archive, Hong Kong; Matthias Mühling, Director,    Städtische Galerie im    Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau, Munich; Patrizia Sandretto Re  Rebaudengo, President, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo,  Turin; Philip Tinari, Director, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art,  Beijing; and Samson Young, artist and winner of the  first BMW Art Journey. “We were deeply impressed with the group of artists we reviewed, and  those we selected. Their profiles are very different in terms of  practice, research, and expressive modality, and this infuses a great  richness to the group. Together, their varied perspectives and ways of  working the artistic horizon of the BMW Art Journey,” stated the jury  in its unanimous decision.“The Paris-based French-Caribbean artist Julien  Creuzet is a traveler between genres and cultures. His hybrid  practice includes film and animation, music, poetry and sculpture. His  multi-layered assemblages explore different cultural heritages. His  gaze on history and on different geographies, on minor and forgotten  tales, is important for building new collective scenarios. South  Korean Kelvin Kyung Kun Park’s multi-disciplinary  work deals with notions of the individual versus the collective,  nature versus conditioning – topics that have tremendous potential in  generating a research journey across time and culture. His videos,  performances, and photographs explore the fundamental structures of  those mediums, and of contemporary society. Alice  Wang, who lives and works between Shanghai and Los Angeles,  makes sculptures and films that take us on epic journeys unfolding  across space, time and materials to bring us closer to understanding  our place in the universe. Each work tells a different story that  transverses the surreal and sublime, leaving us to question what is in  fact truth and what is fiction,” notes the jury.Works of this year’s shortlisted artists can be viewed following the  announcement in a virtual  showroom at “Art Basel Live: Hong Kong” the digital overlay of the  fair. As official partner of the show, BMW will host a virtual partner  room at “Art Basel Live: Hong Kong” showcasing works and  documentations of previous BMW Art Journey winners.Launched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a collaboration between Art  Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging and  mid-career artists worldwide. Past winners of the BMW Art Journey  include sound and performance artist Samson Young  (presented by a.m. Space, Hong Kong at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in  2015); video artists Henning Fehr and Philipp Rühr  (presented by Galerie Max Mayer, Dusseldorf at Art Basel's Miami Beach  show in 2015); Abigail Reynolds (presented by Rokeby,  London at Art Basel's show in Hong Kong in 2016) as well as    Max Hooper Schneider (presented by High Art, Paris  at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2016), Astha  Butail (represented by GALLERYSKE, New Dehli, Bangalore at  Art Basel´s Hong Kong show in 2017), Jamal Cyrus  (represented by Inman Gallery, Houston at Art Basel’s Miami Beach show  in 2017), Zac Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael  Lett, Auckland at Art Basel’s Hong Kong show in 2018), Lu  Yang (represented by the gallery Société, Berlin at Art  Basel's Hong Kong show in 2019) and Leelee Chan  (represented by Capsule Shanghai at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2021).In collaboration with the winning artist, the journey will be  documented and shared through publications, online and via social  media.

In his work he creates protean artworks  incorporating poetry, music, sculpture, assemblage, film and  animation. Evoking trans-oceanic postcolonial transactions in relation  to multiple temporalities the artist places his own inherited past,  present and future at the heart of his production. Eluding generalized  narratives and cultural reductions, Creuzet’s work often spotlights  anachronisms and social realities to construct objects of  irreducibility. Recent solo exhibitions of the artist include Camden  Arts Center, London (upcoming); Palais de Tokyo, Paris and Fondation  d'entreprise Pernod Ricard, Paris. His work was on display at group  exhibitions at Manifesta 13, Marseilles; Museum für Moderne Kunst,  Frankfurt; Musée d’Art moderne de Paris and Centre Pompidou, Paris.

Holidays in the region and journeys of  discovery through the local countryside will continue to be high on  the list of priorities for many people seeking relaxation in the  summer of 2021. The desire to relax in nature also inspires a  preference for camping. These holiday trends are beneficial for the  eco-balance, especially when they are combined with sustainable  mobility. MINI has two models with electrified drive and matching  optional equipment on offer for all those who want to be both flexible  and particularly efficient on the road: the MINI Cooper SE Countryman  ALL4 (fuel consumption combined: 1.9 - 1.7 l/100 km according to WLTP,  2.1 - 1.9 l/100 km according to NEDC;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Time to go racing: BMW Motorrad Motorsport kicks off its campaign in the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship.;This weekend, BMW Motorrad Motorsport starts into the 2021 WorldSBK. After the development period and winter tests, the new BMW M 1000 RR is now set for its race debut. For the first time, the 2021 WorldSBK grid will feature four riders on the BMW M 1000 RR. Tom Sykes and Michael van der Mark start for the works team, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Jonas Folger and Eugene Laverty line up for BMW satellite teams Bonovo MGM Racing and RC Squadra Corse.;Munich. The wait is over. This weekend, BMW Motorrad    Motorsport kicks off its campaign in the 2021 FIM Superbike World    Championship (WorldSBK). After the development period and winter    tests, the new BMW M 1000 RR is now set for its race debut. For the    first time, the 2021 WorldSBK grid will feature four riders on the    BMW M 1000 RR. Tom Sykes (GBR) and BMW newcomer Michael van der Mark    (NED) start for the works team, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team.    Jonas Folger (GER) and Eugene Laverty (IRL) line up for BMW    satellite teams Bonovo MGM Racing and RC Squadra Corse. After a break of over half a year, the season gets underway with a  double-header in Spain and Portugal. The first race weekend of the  year will take place from 21st to 23rd May at MotorLand Aragón (ESP).  This is followed just one week later (28th to 30th May) by round two  of the season at Estoril (POR). In preparation for the season, BMW  Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW teams were at MotorLand Aragón for a  pre-season test roughly two weeks ago. The new BMW M 1000 RR is a consistent development of the BMW S 1000  RR. At the heart of the new M RR is the engine. Like the engine for  the production model, it has been developed specifically for racing.  The chassis geometry and aerodynamics have also been improved. In a  two-part video documentary, BMW Motorrad Motorsport shows the route  from assembly to the racetrack, from the production of the engines at  the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin (GER), and the assembly of the race  bikes at the headquarters of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team in  Guisborough (GBR), to the works and satellite teams’ outings on the  track at MotorLand Aragón. The videos are available for download and  further use here in the BMW Group PressClub and can also be viewed on  the BMW Motorrad YouTube channel: b.mw/Launch_2021_Part_1  and b.mw/Launch_2021_Part_2.  Quotes ahead of the opening round of the 2021 WorldSBK season. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  go into the 2021 WorldSBK season with a lot of new features. For  example, we are obviously looking forward to the race debut of our BMW  M 1000 RR. The tests went very well and, although we still have a bit  of work ahead of us with the new bike, I am feeling very positive. I  would like to say another big thank you to everyone who has been so  full of enthusiasm for their role in the development, assembly and  preparation of the M RR: our production colleagues and engineers in  Munich, engine production in Berlin, the team members and, of course,  our riders. Another important step for our WorldSBK project is the  fact that we are now more broadly positioned than before. As well as  our established works team, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, our family  now also includes the satellite teams Bonovo MGM Racing and RC Squadra  Corse. When it comes to the riders, we are also very strongly  positioned, with Tom Sykes, Michael van der Mark, Eugene Laverty and  Jonas Folger. Our goal for the season is to close the gap to the  front-runners and claim our first win.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We are looking forward to finally get into the race weekend.  It has been a long off-season between Estoril and this first round. I  think we have really taken good steps forward with the BMW M 1000 RR  and I am looking forward to see what we can do in race conditions. The  weather is looking very favourable for Aragón and obviously we go over  there where we last tested so we are confident we can find a good base  setting very quickly and focus on race simulations. We are confident  that Michael and Tom can start on the front foot and we can start our  2021 season in a positive style.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am very  excited to finally get back racing, and what better way to do it than  to do it with a double header? We start in Aragón, which is obviously  a circuit I really enjoy riding. The target is quite clear for me: I  want to get back winning races and being consistently at the sharp and  the target for me as well as for the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team.  On the other side, we have got a little bit of more work we need to do  in order to get to there. So we will see. For me, I just want to get a  good, clean start to the season and get some strong points on the  board from these two race weekends. Aragón is such an enjoyable track.  Also Estoril, a track which was my first time there last year.  Overall, I am very confident and can’t wait to get things started.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  has been such a long time without any racing. Testing of course is  nice, riding the bike, developing the bike – but we are doing it all  for racing. It has been a long winter so I am really looking forward  to it and luckily we have two race weekends in a row. That is good,  and also at races we can learn a lot more about the bike and try to  develop it. In general, I think we are really well prepared, but for  sure we have to make some more steps with the bike in development. But  as I said, racing is always better as you can have a look at your  opponents and see their stronger points and their weaker points.  MotorLand Aragón is a nice track to start the season;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
On the final straight to unique driving dynamics: The new BMW 2 Series Coupé.;At the end of its series development process, the new edition of the sports car in the premium compact segment completes its driving dynamics tuning and testing run. Production starts in late summer 2021.;Munich. The new BMW 2 Series Coupé is on the final  stretch as it heads to the front row of the grid. The final phase of  the series development process for the new edition of the BMW 2 Series  Coupé has begun with the dynamic testing and tuning of its drive and  suspension systems under racetrack conditions. The two-door compact  sports car features numerous hallmark ingredients that are unique in  the premium compact segment for achieving a sporty and emotional  driving experience, which are carefully coordinated during the test  drives. This is what underpins this car’s claim to taking pole  position in its class. The unique selling points of the new BMW 2  Series Coupé in the competitive environment include the rear-wheel  drive setup, an extremely powerful in-line 6-cylinder engine, the  almost 50:50 balanced axle load distribution, an extremely torsionally  stiff body and chassis technology consistently designed for agile and  dynamic driving behaviour.Sporty driving pleasure in the tradition of the BMW  2002.The new BMW 2 Series Coupé, which will be  manufactured from late summer 2021, is designed for uncompromising  sporty driving pleasure. It continues the tradition of the brand's  particularly driver-oriented, compact and powerful two-door models,  which have been built since the legendary BMW 2002. In terms of power  delivery, traction, cornering dynamics and handling precision, the new  BMW 2 Series Coupé meets the needs of particularly discerning  customers who are enthusiastic about unadulterated sportiness in a  compact premium automobile.During the development of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé, the test and  tuning drives on the Nürburgring's Nordschleife serve as the ultimate  test for wheel suspension, chassis, damping, steering and braking  system. In addition, testing on public country roads around Munich and  at the BMW Group test site in Maisach ensure that the dynamic driving  qualities of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé can also be experienced in  everyday traffic and under different road conditions. By extensively  testing all drive and chassis systems, the development and test  engineers ensure that the engine's performance characteristics go hand  in hand with precisely controllable handling in every situation,  fascinating cornering dynamics, optimised traction in all weather and  road conditions and perfectly balanced ride comfort. At the same time,  the car is fine-tuned to optimise self-steering behaviour and the  dynamics when building up lateral acceleration forces. The power  transmission to the rear wheels, which is unique in the segment of the  new BMW 2 Series Coupé, is ideally suited to sporty, ambitious  cornering including easily controllable drift manoeuvres.BMW M version at the top of the model range.The  new BMW 2 Series Coupé's focus on maximum driving dynamics in the  segment is embodied particularly by the BMW M version at the top of  the model range.

Statement and Presentation by Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, 101st Annual General Meeting of BMW AG in Munich on 12th May 2021;Statement and Presentation Zipse AGM 2021.;Good Morning to all our shareholders! A very warm welcome from BMW Welt in Munich. The Annual General Meeting is the most important event of the year  for us. It is where we answer to you – the owners of BMW AG – and show  you where your company is headed. All members of the Board of Management and almost all the Supervisory  Board are here today – naturally in compliance with coronavirus  restrictions – as Dr Reithofer mentioned – and as a sign of our  respect for you. BMW has a “WE” culture. I would therefore like to start by thanking all our customers  worldwide, who choose to buy our products and motivate us to do our  very best. We stand together – because that is our culture. There might be  tough discussions sometimes between company managers and employee  representatives – but, at the end of the day, they always find the  best solution for BMW. That is something we learned from the  entrepreneur Herbert Quandt. He believed in BMW. He stepped in to  rescue the company in 1959, laying the foundations for our success.  This spirit lives on to this day. And we look forward to the next  generation carrying it together with us into the future. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board propose a  dividend of 1.90 euros per share of common stock and  1.92 euros per  share of preferred stock for the financial year 2020. This is lower  than last year; in  some areas, it is even lower than the 1.5-degree goal. We are only measuring ourselves against goals we can actually  achieve. That is why we joined the Science-Based Targets Initiative. Our approach is holistic:RE:THINK. RE:DUCE. RE:USE. RE:CYCLE.That is also our core idea for the IAA MOBILITY in September and  the circular economy is our central theme. How much energy do we consume?How many resources?What do we use them for?Every business model will have to answer these questions in the future. Humankind is still taking more than 100 billion tonnes of raw  materials out of the earth every year: This cannot work as a long-term solution. Our electric cars are designed to be sustainable. This will be the  overall product of: The technology for this is extremely demanding, because a  climate-friendly car is not created simply by using green power. We are completely rethinking our vehicles, from the very first moment  of their development. The “NEUE KLASSE” is a radical new approach.The name will be familiar to some of you, I’m sure.BMW completely reinvented itself back in the early 60s. BMW completely reinvented itself back in the early 60s. Back then, our new mid-size models captured the spirit of the times –  fresh, dynamic and progressive. Today, although the circumstances are different, we are once again  living through a time of change. Now, by naming a whole vehicle generation the “NEUE KLASSE”, we are  once again sending a clear signal for the future and for the coming decades. The “NEUE KLASSE” we will launch in 2025 is a radically new product  offering for the markets of the future. Our combined know-how will go into this development, as well as  massive investment. Electric. Digital. Circular.That is what characterises the “NEUE KLASSE”. It will bring a variety of very different and surprising vehicles. It represents a decisive step in the transformation of your company  and includes a new vehicle architecture that is uncompromisingly  tailored to electric drive trains. Our battery cells are not only powerful, safe and cost-effective –  they will also be recyclable. The high-voltage battery is an important factor in the carbon  footprint of any electric car. The next generation will reduce the battery’s carbon footprint by  half, compared to the current Gen5 technology. One thing is clear: The situation in the global raw materials markets  will remain very difficult. That’s why we are tying the “NEUE KLASSE” to a new efficiency imperative. Instead of precious primary materials, we are using secondary  materials in our vehicles, such as recycled steel, plastics and aluminium. I refer to this paradigm shift as “secondary first”. We are creating a “NEUE KLASSE” for a new age and making your company  sustainable. By 2030, we will reduce our carbon footprint per vehicle by at least  a third from 2019 levels. This is not just an ambition or a vision; it is a binding target for  us, because attitudes are reflected in behaviour. Long before the US elections, your company agreed on ambitious  climate goals with the State of California. These are now being discussed with the Biden administration. This is just one example of how we also act consistently in our  second home - in accordance with our convictions. There will be no sudden U-turns from BMW. This year, for the first time and as the first company in our  industry to do so, we are presenting an integrated report. We are documenting our sustainable development and financial  indicators with equal weighting in a single report; both are subject  to the same degree of scrutiny. Overall, our promise regarding e-mobility is: 80 – 40 – 20. This is how we intend to reduce CO2 emissions per vehicle  throughout the entire lifecycle by 2030: Therefore our entire approach is holistic and implemented in  conjunction with our suppliers. Take a look for yourselves.  Sustainability is like a jigsaw puzzle.Together, the individual pieces create the perfect picture: As you can see:Your company is taking responsible action to create completely  sustainable mobility.According to forecasts, e-mobility will continue to grow in leaps and  bounds from 2025. That is why we are electrifying BMW faster than ever and our  production network is integrating electrification into the existing  plant structure. Take a look at our e-mobility roadmap up to 2030:   Your company is growing and entering a new electric dimension. How quickly this happens will also depend on charging infrastructure.  Everyone is asking how quickly it can be expanded: As far as I’m  concerned, it can’t happen quickly enough. Right now, sales of electric cars are growing four times faster than  charging stations in Germany. Individual manufacturers’ exclusive charging networks are of little  use in this respect. Our charging station joint venture Ionity can be used by anyone for  high-power charging along motorways. By the end of the year, we will  have set up 400 charging stations with over 1,500 charging points. E-mobility is a project for the whole of society.If we do it right, it should become a flagship project for a  sustainable world – without having to make any sacrifices. Let’s move on to the second topic:We are laying the foundation for the BMW road to 2030 and beyond  right now. Under the challenging conditions of the coronavirus pandemic, we  focused on two things:  You will remember that our last Annual General Meeting was held in  the middle of the global lockdown, a time full of uncertainty. But the BMW Group never really stood still. I promised you then that we were working on the best-possible restart  for your company – and, in fact, we did achieve our adjusted targets  for 2020.  In addition to this, our global market share increased during the  pandemic: from 2.9 percent in the first quarter of 2019 – i.e. before  the pandemic, to 3.3 percent in the first quarter of 2021.2020 gave our electrified vehicles a real boost.Sales of fully-electric vehicles were up 13 percent and plug-in  hybrids 40 percent – a combined increase of a third over the previous year. Electrified vehicles accounted for 15 percent of our total European  sales last year.We had, after all, made a binding commitment to meet the  European Union’s CO2 goals for 2020. We delivered on that promise, with fleet emissions of 99.1 g  CO2 per kilometre. This means that we are significantly  below the limit value assigned to us. We will do the same again this year. You might think this would make high-performance models less  desirable, but BMW M GmbH had its best year ever in 2020. BMW Motorrad presented 13 new models and reported the second-best  sales result in its history. We also made your company even leaner and more efficient in 2020. Let me give you two examples: We promised to take everyone along with us – and you can see this at  our oldest plant in the heart of Munich: Our main plant is going  electric and becoming state-of-the-art. Engine production is being  relocated to make room for a new assembly. To summarise the year 2020 for BMW:  We have learned once again that everything is constantly in motion.  Many trends can be predicted; others cannot. For this reason, we must continue to pull together in 2021.  We already got off to a good start: Our customers bought more vehicles than ever before in a first  quarter, especially in our largest market, China. April was another strong month, with sales up more than 10 percent,  compared to the comparable figure for the pre-coronavirus year 2019. The Automotive Segment delivered an EBIT margin of 9.8 percent in the  first quarter – back within our usual medium-term target range of 8 to  10 percent for the first time in ten quarters. Our good start to the year is also reflected in the BMW share price,  with the price of our common stock up around 15 percent since the  start of the year alone (updated 7 May, +16.1%). However, there is still a long way to go until the end of the year –  and there are still a number of risks: the course of the coronavirus  pandemic; difficulties with semiconductor supplies; the situation in  the raw material markets. Risks are part of our business – and companies aim to grow in every environment. Global companies also face an additional challenge.Whether they are progressive or established, they need to identify  where markets are headed. We are targeting the milestone of three million vehicles per year  well before the end of the decade. Our aim is to achieve profitable growth within our target range. I am confident we will succeed because our product portfolio is  perfectly suited to the current demographic and economic trends, with  the technology to meet varied demand for different types of drive train. Our intelligent vehicle architectures show how good your company is  at integrating very different systems and requirements in an optimal manner. Our plants produce different types of drive trains within a single structure. BMW is global. We serve 140 markets – and that’s why offer our customers exactly the  drive trains they ask for – because we do not want to miss out on any  market opportunities; because we are not on a consolidation course;"  and because we have the expertise to master the complexity. This is referred to in tech jargon as “flexible exchangeability”. The popular BMW X3 already comes with four drive train variants,  including the fully-electric iX3 built in China. The iX3 received the highest praise from German magazine Auto Motor  und Sport, beating all its rivals in a comparative test. Now, we are ramping things up with the BMW X1 model series, the 5  Series, 7 Series and the MINI Countryman – all with a choice of drive  technologies.  Technology openness pays off – as shown by the fact that BMW is the  global market leader in plug-in hybrids. At the same time, we are conducting research into e-fuels and hydrogen. Next year we will unveil a BMW X5 with a fuel cell drive. A small  series of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT will show how we envision the  hydrogen drive train. Ladies and Gentlemen,Climate protection through technological innovations is not just an  exciting area of activity – it is also a lot of joy. When we, the Board of Management, get to test and rate our vehicles,  we always try to be as neutral as possible.But, truth be told, we are always absolutely thrilled by our products. And I was very happy to see for myself that the media had big smiles  on their faces last week when they tested our fully-electric BMW i4.  Their feedback was extremely positive. We are delighted – but not surprised. The i4 comes right from the heart of BMW.Last year, it was the BMW i4 concept car standing here.Today, it is the production model that will be available as of  autumn, along with our innovation and technology flagship, the BMW iX,  which really has it all: up to 600 km electric range, according to  WLTP, short charging times and an experiential interior. It represents  technology in its purest form – but you don’t see it and you don’t  feel it, because everything is intuitive:We call this shy tech.Check it out for yourselves! The i4 and iX offer the very best of electric driving pleasure.They are also produced using domestic hydroelectric power from the  Isar and Lech rivers.Our new sales approach will come into effect with the launch of the  i4 and iX. Our Sales and Marketing team is digitalising the product and  purchasing experience so mobility can be experienced in digital form:  Configuration, ordering and delivery are all available digital and  contact-free in more than 60 countries already. It is our firm belief that digitalisation should serve humankind.And because we all just expect it to work, without being too obvious,  we are making the technology in our vehicles simple and precise. Shy  tech is designed to inspire our customers and make their lives easier. Together with Apple, we developed the BMW Digital Key, the first car  key integrated directly into the iPhone. In the BMW iX, the Digital Key Plus comes with ultra-wideband  technology, making it even safer and more convenient.The iX is a digital powerhouse, with our most powerful data  processing system ever:Our BMW Operating System 8 with 5G processes 20 times more data than before. We developed it ourselves for the new BMW iDrive. Our new operating system – the simplest and most secure in our  industry – connects people with their cars.Third-party services can be seamlessly integrated – whether they are  from Apple, Google, Tencent or Spotify. Our customers can be sure that their vehicles come with the very  latest technology, which we update in real time over the air.  Take a look for yourselves. We are not only digitalising our vehicles, but also processes across  the company and in production. Take our partnership with NVIDIA, the global market leader in  graphics cards:Together, we are creating a virtual version of our production network. Imagine each plant having a digital twin.This makes our planning processes even more precise, faster and more efficient.Standing here next to me is the fully-electric MINI. Customers love it – and our order books are full. It has been 20 years since the first MINI developed by BMW rolled off  the production line at Plant Oxford.  Since then, we have built more than five million MINIs in the UK. I  actually spent two years in charge of production in Oxford myself, so  I am especially pleased to share with you today that MINI will be our  first all-electric brand. MINI is perfect for the city and for e-mobility. We will be releasing  the last model with a combustion-engine variant in 2025.By the early 2030s, the brand will be exclusively fully electric. BMW Motorrad also went electric a long time ago. Our Definition CE 04 is also perfect for the city.Its world premiere will be in summer.We will have a lot more to show you at the IAA MOBILITY. The Rolls-Royce team is also hard at work on a fully-electric  offering. Look out for that! Dear Shareholders,Electric. Digital. Sustainable. This is your company.For a new age, when individual mobility will no longer be a climate factor.We are making big plans:Because we want to and because we can.Because we have an obligation towards our customers – so they can  stay mobile.Because we want the investment made by you, our shareholders, to  continue to be worthwhile.And because we have an obligation towards the BMW Group, our unique  company with emotional, globally desirable brands.Our long-term perspective is our way of making an effective  contribution to society. We are looking far into the future and laying the foundation today  for the BMW road to 2050. We hope you will continue to stand by us. Stay healthy – and thank  you for your attention. """;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Over 200 million tonnes: BMW Group sets ambitious goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 2030;The BMW Group is underpinning its mission for sustainable mobility with ambitious goals for the reduction of greenhouse gases: At today’s Annual General Meeting, the company announced that it will avoid emission of over 200 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030.

The BMW Group is underpinning its mission for  sustainable mobility with ambitious goals for the reduction of  greenhouse gases: At today’s Annual General Meeting, the company  announced that it will avoid emission of over 200 million    tonnes of CO2 by 2030. This is equivalent to more than    20 times the annual CO2 emissions of a city with  over a million inhabitants, like Munich. To achieve this, the BMW  Group is reducing its vehicles’ carbon footprint throughout    their lifecycle – from raw material extraction, through  production and the use phase, to end-of-life recycling. Going forward,  using fewer resources will be one of the priorities. “A climate-friendly car is not created solely by using green power.  We must design our vehicles for sustainability from the very first day  of development: reducing the amount of material used to manufacture  them and, above all, planning for reuse and recycling from the very  beginning. In the face of rising raw material prices, this is not just  an environmental, but also a business imperative,” said Oliver  Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, at the  Annual General Meeting in Munich on Wednesday. “The technology for  this is extremely demanding: That is why we want to lead the way on  the circular economy and play a pioneering role. We are already  working on quotas for the use of secondary material in our “Neue  Klasse” that are both concrete and ambitious to meet our high standards. RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE, RE:CYCLE – BMW Group makes circular    economy central theme of IAA MOBILITY 2021 The BMW Group will highlight the future potential of  the circular economy for environmental and climate  protection at the IAA MOBILITY 2021 in September. The  company's “RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE, RE:CYCLE” approach provides a  holistic view of how the use of primary raw materials can be  drastically reduced in the cars of the future. The BMW Group already plans to take sustainability to a radically new  level in its “Neue Klasse” models from the middle of  the decade by significantly reducing its    resource consumption per vehicle. The aim is to  substantially increase the percentage of secondary  material, such as recycled steel, plastics and aluminium.  Faced with a shortage of natural resources and rising  raw material prices, the BMW Group sees this step as a crucial lever  for sustainable business practices and creating    a clear efficiency imperative. To achieve this, the BMW Group has initiated a paradigm  shift in development with its “secondary  first” approach, i.e. using secondary material wherever the  quality and availability of materials allow. Carbon footprint of high-voltage battery to be reduced by more    than half The high-voltage battery plays a unique role in  this: The process of manufacturing the battery and producing battery  cells is extremely energy-intensive and therefore an  important factor in the carbon footprint of any electric car. With the    next generation of battery technology to be  introduced in the “Neue Klasse”, the BMW Group aims  to reduce the carbon footprint of the high-voltage battery to    less than half the baseline value for the current  Gen5 technology. In addition to the shift to green power already  implemented by cell manufacturers, the new battery and cell  concept, combined with enhanced cell  chemistry, will also make a significant contribution. Another  factor is the growing percentage of secondary  material in the battery cells and high-voltage battery as a  whole. The housing in the BMW iX* already contains up  to 30 percent secondary aluminium and up to 50  percent secondary nickel, which is a key raw  material, is used in the battery cell. At the same time, the BMW Group  has limited its use of critical raw materials in the current  generation of battery cells and reduced the amount of  cobalt in the cathode material to less than    ten percent. The electric motor no longer requires    the use of rare earths. “Circular design” as basis for circular economy Recycling needs are already considered in the vehicle  design – because extracting materials in a very pure  form is a central challenge for current recycling  processes. For example, the electrical system must be easy to  remove, prior to recycling, to avoid mixing the steel with copper from  the vehicle’s wiring harness. Otherwise, the secondary steel no longer  meets the automotive industry’s strict safety  requirements. The use of mono-materials –  for instance, in seats – must be significantly increased to enable the  maximum amount possible to be fed back into the material cycle. Another key aspect is efficient dismantling  capability. For secondary materials to be  able to compete in the marketplace, the vehicle and  individual components must be dismantled quickly and cost-effectively  as a preliminary to recycling. The prerequisites for this must be put  in place when designing the vehicle – for example, by  not securing connections with adhesive, but designing them so they can  be detached again at the end of the vehicle life and ensuring  different materials are not mixed with one another. CO2 reduction goals validated by Science-Based Targets    Initiative – entire production will become completely net carbon neutral from 2021 The BMW Group made sustainability and resource efficiency the focus  of its strategic direction in 2020 and, with this realignment, is  pursuing a much more ambitious course than the goal  of limiting the increase in global temperature to two degrees.  Throughout the vehicle lifecycle and all three scopes considered, the  BMW Group has set measurable and verifiable goals  that have since been validated by the    Science-Based Targets Initiative: TopicCO2 reduction up to 2030 (from        2019)Equivalent climate goalProduction and          locationsScope 1+2-80% per vehiclemore ambitious than 1.5°CgoalSupply chainScope 3        upstreamat least -20% per        vehicle1.75°C goalUse phaseScope 3        downstreammore than -40%          per vehicle/kmwithin          target range of 1.5 -1.75°C goalEntire lifecycleScope 1-3at least -33% per vehiclewithin target range of 1.5 - 1.75°C goal Each of these goals represents a substantive reduction in  emissions – in other words, a real decrease in CO2 emissions  per vehicle. A key factor is that BMW Group production and all  locations have been sourcing 100-percent green power since the end of  2020. Starting this year, the BMW Group is also  offsetting its remaining CO2 emissions (Scope 1+2) through  selected offsetting measures, which also cover  emissions from company cars and business trips, for example. This  means that, from 2021 on, the BMW Group’s entire production, including  all its locations worldwide, will be completelynet carbon neutral. For the BMW Group, one thing is certain: Such measures are an  important factor in offsettingthe net impact of climate-damaging emissions –  however, they must not delay substantive measures that can deliver a  real reduction in emissions. For this reason, the BMW Group  only applies these measures for its remaining  carbon emissions that are still unavoidable –  for example, from the use of highly efficient co-generation plants. “As far as the BMW Group is concerned: Avoiding comes before  offsetting. In this way, we have already lowered our energy  consumption per vehicle produced by more than a third from 2006 levels  and were even able to reduce the corresponding CO2 emissions per  vehicle produced by over 70 percent,” said Zipse. The BMW Group is the first automotive manufacturer  to set itself concrete targets for reducing CO2 emissions in its    supply chain by 2030. In addition to the use of  green power for the energy-intensive production of fifth-generation  battery cells, further measures have been initiated – for example,    solar power will be used in the future for  production of aluminium, which is also highly  energy-intensive. The BMW Group is also investing in an innovative  method for carbon-free steel production, developed by    US startup Boston Metal, through its venture  capital fund, BMW i Ventures. 2030: At least 50 percent of global sales fully electric  A key driver for the decarbonisation of individual mobility and the  most important factor in reducing CO2 emissions during the use phase  will be the massive ramp-up of electromobility – which the BMW Group  has stepped up even more in recent years. The company will offer five  fully-electric models by the end of this year: the BMW i3*, the  MINI SE* and the BMW iX3*, as well as the two main innovation  flagships, the BMW iX* and the BMW i4*. These will be followed in the  coming years by fully-electric versions of the high-volume BMW 5  Series and the BMW X1. They will also be joined by the BMW 7 Series,  the successor to the MINI Countryman and other models. By 2023, the  BMW Group will have at least one fully-electric model  on the roads in about 90 percent of its current market segments. Between now and 2025, the BMW Group will  increase its sales of fully-electric models by an  average of well over 50 percent per year –    more than ten times the number of units sold in  2020. Based on its current market forecast, the company also expects    at least 50 percent of its global sales to come from    fully-electric vehicles in 2030. The actual figure may vary  significantly from market to market and will ultimately depend to a  large extent on how much progress is made in expanding charging  infrastructure at regional level. At this point, there will no longer be any segment position in the  BMW Group’s entire product portfolio where the  company does not offer at least one fully-electric model. Individual  segments may, in fact, be served exclusively by fully-electric models.  The company will also be capable of handling a much larger percentage  of fully-electric vehicles if demand develops accordingly. In total,  over the next ten years or so, the BMW Group will release about    ten million fully-electric vehicles onto the roads. Definition CE 04 – Electric production vehicle to be unveiled    this summer BMW Motorrad is also expanding its range of electric  vehicles on two wheels for urban spaces: At #NEXTGen 2020, the company  shared a concrete vision of what a production vehicle that could soon  take one-track electromobility in cities to a whole new level, both  technically and optically, might look like, with the BMW Motorrad  Definition CE 04. The BMW Group will be presenting the corresponding  production model this summer.  *Consumption/emissions data: BMW iX: Power consumption in kWh/100 km: 22.5-19.5  WLTP.

The MINI Convertible: the future is ready for it. ;MINI continues the realignment of its model range and announces the development of a successor to the open-top four-seater.;"Munich. Electrification, the conquest of new target  groups and a consistent customer orientation are at the heart of the  realignment with which the British premium brand MINI is setting the  course for its future model range. Following the announcement of a new  generation of the brand's purely electric small cars, another decision  has now been made: The success story of the MINI Convertible will be  continued. The development of a successor to the only open-top  four-seater in the premium small car segment is a done deal. The new  model is scheduled to be unveiled in 2025. ""The MINI Convertible  has a large and particularly loyal fan base. This is also shown by the  great demand for the latest, freshly updated model,"" says Bernd  Körber, Head of the MINI brand. ""We are therefore firmly  convinced of the success of this vehicle concept for the future.""With the new edition of the MINI Convertible launched a few weeks  ago, the brand's typical open-air driving pleasure has gained even  more appeal. The clear and reduced design expresses the vehicle's  extravagant charisma more intensively than ever - especially with the  body paint in the new Zesty Yellow variant available exclusively for  the MINI Convertible. In addition, the unmistakable design features of  the open-top MINI are showcased particularly effectively. The  hexagonal radiator grille is larger than ever, the standard LED  headlights have been redesigned as have the Side Scuttles, the black  wheel arch surrounds have been given new contours, and the rear lights  in the striking Union Jack design are now standard equipmentWith its fresh look, new standard and optional equipment and  innovative operating system, the MINI Convertible continues a success  story that began some three decades ago. After the prototype at the  British Motor Show in Birmingham in 1992 had already caused  enthusiastic reactions from the public, a convertible version was  added to the classic Mini for the first time. And even after the  relaunch of the brand, fans did not have to do without open-top  driving fun in typical MINI style. Since 2004, the combination of  go-kart feeling and open-air fun has thrilled discerning target groups  all over the world. At times, MINI's open-top four-seater was the  best-selling convertible in the world.The current MINI Convertible is not only the original in its vehicle  class, but also a true one-off as the only open-top model in the  premium small car segment. Three equally powerful and efficient  engines with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology ensure driving pleasure  made to measure.

BMW Motorrad expands equipment range for the R 18 and R 18 Classic. ;High-grade Option 719 parts for perfect detail customisation available from September 2021.;"Munich. The existing range of optional equipment and  the still growing range of Original BMW Motorrad accessories offer  many possibilities for customizing the R 18 and R 18 Classic according  to your own preferences. With the introduction of the Option 719  parts, BMW Motorrad is now adding features that enable highest-level  bike customisation based on historical roots. After all, the internal  code ""719"" at BMW Motorrad already stood for particularly  high-quality and exclusive special equipment, unusual special requests  and unique items decades ago. The new Option 719 parts will be  available from September 2021.Option 719 Design Package AERO.The Option 719  Design Package AERO includes the cylinder head covers on the left and  right, the front cover and the intake snorkel cover on the left and  right. All parts are made of aluminium sheet with a brushed,  colourless anodised surface. The cylinder head covers feature finely  wrought air vents reminiscent of the “streamliners” of the 1920s and  1930s. The highlight is a badge on the front and side covers: This is  made of solid copper which is chrome-plated and partially finished in  white. The white paint enclosing the number sequence “719” is  reminiscent of historical emblems that were typically lined with  enamel during that era.Option 719 seat.For the new R 18 and R 18 Classic, the Option 719 seat is a  particularly exclusive alternative to the standard seat. In addition  to the standard seat height, it offers a fascinating material  selection and finish. For example, two black upper materials are used,  which are combined with diamond-shaped quilted embossing. An  embroidered BMW logo and the 719 symbol on the side round off this  exclusive seat.Option 719 Paint finish Galaxy Dust metallic/Titanium Silver 2 metallic.The colour Galaxy Dust metallic is a flip-flop finish that  shimmers in a spectrum from violet to turquoise blue, depending on the  incidence of light. In addition, the many large effect pigments create  a unique visual effect when exposed to sunlight. This special finish  is combined with a Titanium Silver 2 metallic mirror on the fuel tank.  The transition between the two colour surfaces consists of a  hand-applied smoke effect familiar from the legendary R 90 S. In  addition, the mirror surface is surrounded by a classic white double line.Option 719 Wheels AERO and ICON.The two Option 719 wheel sets AERO and ICON in the basic colours  matt silver and matt black, respectively, provide a particularly  refined and technically sophisticated look. The cast alloy wheels  feature a six-spoke design. The milled filigree ribs of the spokes are  a real eye-catcher. The milled areas give the aluminium a fascinating  contrast with the paint colour of the wheels - hence the name Contrast Cut.R 18 and R 18 Classic: Successful market launch with the First    Edition models.BMW Motorrad entered the cruiser segment with the market launch  of the R 18 in September 2020, followed in February 2021 by the R 18  Classic, the second member of the new model series. The R 18 Classic  embodies the nostalgic tourer, echoing the beginnings of the big  cruisers suitable for touring. Compared to the very purist R 18, the R  18 Classic is characterised above all by the large windshield, the  pillion seat, the saddlebags, the LED auxiliary headlights and the  16-inch front wheel.Both R 18 models are rooted in the tradition of historic BMW  motorcycles. Both technically and visually, they borrow from renowned  models such as the BMW R 5 and focus back on the essentials of the  motorcycle: purist, straight-up technology and the boxer engine as the  epicentre of riding pleasure, combined with ""good vibrations"".The very successful market launch of the BMW R 18 and the R 18  Classic was carried out with the First Edition models. Production of  these exclusive, limited-edition models will already cease at the end  of July 2021, after more than 13,000 units have been manufactured to date.You will find press material on BMW motorcycles and BMW Motorrad  rider equipment in the BMW Group PressClub at www.press.bmwgroup.com.In case of queries please contact:Dominik Schaidnagel, BMW Motorrad CommunicationsTel.: +49-89-382-50181, Dominik.Schaidnagel@bmw.deTim Diehl-Thiele, Head of Communications BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-57505, Tim.Diehl-Thiele@bmw.deJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108, Jennifer.Ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.deInternet: www.press.bmw.deE-mail: presse@bmw.deThe BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad,  the BMW Group is the world's leading premium manufacturer of  automobiles and motorbikes and also provides premium financial and  mobility services.

BMW M GmbH and Hans Zimmer co-develop the emotionally engaging driving sound for electrified BMW M models.;Ongoing expansion of the range of sounds for electric vehicles. BMW IconicSounds Electric enriches electric mobility with a fascinating and unmistakable sonic experience. Collaboration with the Academy Award winner produces a new, characteristic driving sound for the BMW i4, the M version of the BMW i4 and the BMW iX.;Munich.The future of driving pleasure is electric, locally emission-free –  and characterised by a typically BMW sporting flair expressed not only  in dynamic talent, but also through an emotionally rich aural  experience. BMW IconicSounds Electric brings an unmistakable sound  portfolio to BMW models powered by a fully electric or plug-in hybrid  drive system. The collaboration between composer and curator Hans  Zimmer and Renzo Vitale, Creative Director Sound at the BMW Group, has  produced a distinctive driving sound which customers will soon be able  to experience in a version developed specially for electric BMW M  cars. “Every BMW has its own character, which is reflected in the  sound it makes,” says film music creator and Academy Award winner  Zimmer. “So for the electrically driven BMW M models we have developed  a driving sound which accentuates their emotional driving experience  particularly vividly and ensures their performance can be felt with  even greater intensity.”Hans Zimmer had previously been involved in the development of an  inspiring ready-to-drive sound for electrically powered BMWs which  instils a sense of excitement at the prospect of electric driving when  the Start/Stop button is pressed. The latest chapter in this  collaboration covers drive sounds for the BMW iX and BMW i4, including  a differentiated sound for the M-specification version of the BMW i4.While the hush of electric driving offers an unprecedented level of  comfort, the driving experience loses a degree of emotionality. This  is where BMW IconicSounds Electric steps in to put smiles on the faces  of customers keen to experience Sheer Driving Pleasure with all the  senses. In the future, electric driving pleasure will be enhanced by  acoustic feedback to every movement of the accelerator. Like the  on-board driving modes selectable at the touch of a button, the  driving sound also takes its cues from the driving situation at hand  and the driver’s personal preferences. In the basic setting, BMW  IconicSounds Electric employs a strikingly transparent timbre with  spherical components to convey the basic character of an electrically  driven BMW brand model. An immersive and pleasant atmosphere is  created initially in the BMW i4 in COMFORT mode. But when the driver  steps on the accelerator, the direct relationship between how the car  is being driven and the sounds it makes is immediately revealed: the  sound experience deepens as load and speed increase. In SPORT mode, in  particular, the car’s aural spectrum is more dominant and powerful,  the sound providing a constant commentary on the driving situation.  Drive system processes are registered within milliseconds and  acceleration, load changes or recuperation given a suitable acoustic  accompaniment. Only when the vehicle is travelling in ECO PRO mode is  the acoustic feedback reduced to nothing. Here, the silence of the  drive system underscores the driver’s decision to adopt an  ultra-efficient driving style.In the version developed specifically for electrified BMW M models,  the drive sound of the BMW i4 is charged with extra energy. Added to  which, the differentiation between COMFORT and SPORT mode is  especially strong. Overall, the drive system note displays a less  harmonious but engagingly rousing and technical sonic profile.  Acceleration sparks a rich intensification of the soundtrack’s  development, authentically reflecting the car’s performance character.  “When you press the pedal of an M car, you suddenly get goosebumps all  over your body,” says sound designer Renzo Vitale. “We translated this  feeling into a drive sound that expresses a fusion of superior power  and flowing energy.”Hans Zimmer and Renzo Vitale had already co-developed the driving  sound for the BMW Vision M NEXT revealed in 2019 and the BMW Concept  i4 presented the following year. Numerous learnings from this creative  process have now been channelled into the design of the sound for  future series-produced vehicles.The new drive sounds developed as part of the collaboration with Hans  Zimmer are expected to feature in the BMW i4 and BMW iX over the  course of 2022. IconicSounds Electric comes as standard in the BMW iX  and can be specified as an option for the BMW i4. In cars with earlier  build dates, the new sounds can be imported retrospectively via Remote  Software Upgrade, should the customer wish. The new spectrum includes  one ready-to-drive sound and one stop sound, plus a driving sound  which will be made available in the relevant version for BMW models  and BMW M cars with electrified drive system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW teams complete dress rehearsal for the 2021 24h Nürburgring on the Nordschleife.;The BMW teams completed the final endurance test ahead of the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring (GER) this weekend, the six-hour qualifying race. ROWE Racing, Schubert Motorsport, Walkenhorst Motorsport and the BMW Junior Team were in action with their BMW M6 GT3s, as were countless other BMW teams in the various classes.;Nürburgring. The BMW teams completed the final endurance test ahead of the    24-hour race at the Nürburgring (GER) this weekend, the six-hour    qualifying race. ROWE Racing, Schubert Motorsport, Walkenhorst    Motorsport and the BMW Junior Team were in action with their BMW M6    GT3s, as were countless other BMW teams in the various classes. The    dress rehearsal for the Eifel classic took place in glorious    weather, and the teams used the weekend to make preparations in race    conditions. The 49th running of the 24-hour race on the    Nordschleife will be held on 5th/6th June. The best-placed BMW car in the final classification of the 24h  qualifying race was the #1 BMW M6 GT3 of ROWE Racing. The quartet of  drivers Nick Catsburg (NED), Nick Yelloly (GBR) John Edwards (USA) and  Philipp Eng (AUT) ended the race in P9, but then moved up into eighth  place. Their ROWE Racing team-mates in the #98 BMW M6 GT3 had  originally crossed the finish line in this position, but the car with  Connor De Phillippi (USA), Martin Tomczyk (GER), Sheldon van der Linde  (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER) at the wheel was disqualified for  violating the minimum number of laps per driver regulation. The #20 BMW M6 GT3 of Schubert Motorsport finished in P14. Jens  Klingmann (GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Stef Dusseldorp (NED) shared  the cockpit of this car. Right behind them in P15 was the BMW Junior  Team in the #77 BMW M6 GT3. Dan Harper (GBR), Neil Verhagen (USA) and  Max Hesse (GER) are set to contest their first 24-hour race in the GT3  car. They will be supported by Augusto Farfus (BRA) in the cockpit.  The #102 BMW M6 GT3 of Walkenhorst Motorsport with Sami-Matti Trogen  (FIN), Jörg Müller (GER) and Jakub Giermaziak (POL) finished the race  in P18, which also saw them make the top 20. There were also several wins for the BMW teams in the individual  classes. Walkenhorst Motorsport won the SP10 class with the #74 BMW M4  GT4. This car was driven by Lance Boicelli, David Thilenius and  Charlie Postins (all USA). The other class winners in BMW cars  included Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive (CUP 5 with the  BMW M2 CS Racing and V2T with the BMW 330i GS20) and AVIA Sorg  Rennsport (BMW M240i). Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH, also competed in the six-hour  qualifying race. He shared duties in the #241 BMW M2 CS Racing with  Matthias Malmedie, Jörg Weidinger und Nikolaus Schelle (all GER).  Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive was responsible for the  car’s outing. The quartet finished in fourth place of the CUP 5 class. Reactions to the qualifying race for 24h Nürburgring: Philipp Eng (#1 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “The race  was a lot of fun. The car felt great, we crossed off everything on our  to-do list and completed our programme. We also compared tyres. The  atmosphere in the team is really good, we’re all helping each other  out and are very open with each other. It’s a lot of fun, and now we  are all really looking forward to the big race at the beginning of June.” Marco Wittmann (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “Aside  from the subsequent penalty, our race was relatively unspectacular. We  started from eighth on the grid and crossed the finish line in the  same position. But our focus this weekend was on sorting a few things  out for the 24-hour race. I was at the wheel for the qualifying  session and a lap of the Nordschleife on your own without any traffic  is great fun. You can really push the car to the limit, and that is  every racing driver’s ultimate dream. Now we are all really looking  forward to the 24-hour race and are hoping for a good result there.” Jens Klingmann (#20 BMW M6 GT3, Schubert Motorsport):  “The weekend was hugely important to us, because we are still a little  behind in terms of experience, so we needed every kilometre. We  weren’t focussed on the result, we viewed the race as a test race,  tried to optimise our pace further, specifically for a long run, and  to fine-tune the set-up. We learned a great deal and I am confident  that we can improve our package even more in the coming weeks, and I’m  really looking forward to the 24-hour race.” Neil Verhagen (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team): “I  am quite happy with the weekend. We definitely learnt a lot in the 24h  qualifying race, which was the main point for us. There are a lot of  things that we still need to smoothen out before the 24-hour race, and  getting the data and all the experience from this six-hour race  definitely will help us a lot to go and push in the big one. We had a  very strong car and if we get everything together then the result will  come. So there is a lot of positives to take away, and now the team  and us will work hard to make sure we are prepared as well as possible  for the 24h Nürburgring.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Maximilian Günther reaches fifth position in Monaco as best-placed German driver.;In the seventh race of the season in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, Maximilian Günther (GER) crossed the finish line fifth in his adopted country, Monaco (MON). He just missed out on the podium but equalled the best result of the season and scored ten important points in the overall standings. After a tight, thrilling race, Günther missed out on second place by just four-tenths of a second in the #28 BMW iFE.21. ;Monaco. In the seventh race of the season in the ABB FIA    Formula E World Championship, Maximilian Günther (GER) crossed the    finish line fifth in his adopted country, Monaco (MON). He just    missed out on the podium but equalled the best result of the season    and scored ten important points in the overall standings. After a    tight, thrilling race, Günther missed out on second place by just    four-tenths of a second in the #28 BMW iFE.21. Having won the    Valencia E-Prix (ESP), Jake Dennis (GBR) suffered back luck this    time. A not-at-fault collision early in the race put him at the back    of the field and he was unable to score any points. With the first    half of the season completed, BMW i Andretti Motorsport is now in    fifth place in the team standings with 55 points. Günther finished third in qualifying to reach Super Pole where he  secured fifth position on the grid. The BMW i Andretti Motorsport  driver was involved in some close-fought duels on the Formula 1  circuit in the principality. He moved up as high as third place and  was battling for his first podium finish of the season. Günther fell  back to fifth place as drivers attempted to get their ATTACK MODE  timings right, but sound energy management gave him the opportunity to  make up some ground towards the end of the race. A minor collision saw  Günther’s chance of a podium finish disappear however, when Oliver  Rowland (GBR, Nissan) clipped him from behind in the port chicane.  Victory went to António Félix da Costa (POR, DS Techeetah). Dennis’ first race in Monaco, and the first after his maiden Formula  E victory in Valencia, did not go according to plan. Starting from  14th on the grid, he was involved in a not-at-fault  accident on the very first lap and dropped to the back of the field.  He subsequently also received a drive-through penalty for excessive  energy use. Dennis finished the race in 16th place in the  #27 BMW iFE.21. The FIA Formula E Safety Car, the MINI Electric Pacesetter inspired  by JCW, pulled the field back together around 15 minutes before the  end after René Rast (GER, Audi) had retired, ensuring that there would  be plenty of excitement in the final stage of the race. Races eight and nine of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E World  Championship take place on 19th and 20th June in  Puebla (MEX). Reactions to Race 7 in Monaco. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 5th place):“It was fantastic to be back here in Monaco and race on the full  track. It’s been a day of mixed fortunes for our two drivers. Fifth  place for Maximilian after P5 in qualifying is a very good result.  It’s important for him to be back in the points and it’s also a good  finish for the team. Unfortunately for Jake it wasn’t the strong  result we had hoped for after such an impressive weekend in Valencia.  We go into the six-week break now and look forward to continuing our  progression up the standings.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    5th place, race result: 5th place, points: 22,    driver standings: 16th place):“First of all P5 was a good start position for us. The race itself  was very spectacular and very strategic. When do you take the ATTACK  MODE, when do you use energy? Every overtaking move was right on the  edge. At one point I was running in P3 but then after the ATTACK MODES  I ended up in P5 fighting with Jean-Éric Vergne. He slightly touched  me in turn 6 and then had the better run through the tunnel to  overtake me. To sum it up, a bit of a shame to have missed the podium  here, but we had a good race and scored good points. That was  important for everybody.  All in all it was a positive day in Monaco.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    14th place, race result: 16th place, points:    33, driver standings: 10th place):“My race was a bit unfortunate. I was in the middle of the pack and  there was a backlog into turn 7. As I got hit, the car flipped into  reverse gear and I lost a lot of time. After that we managed the race  and hoped for a safety car. It came out towards the end but it just  wasn’t enough to gain a lot of positions. I think the biggest thing we  can take away from here is that we learned the track in Monaco. The  performance wasn’t that bad. It is what it is and we move on now.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

Statement Dr Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, Conference Call Interim Report to 31 March 2021;Statement Dr Peter Conference Call Q1 2021;Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning! The BMW Group made a good start to the financial year 2021. Our  operating result in the first quarter was at a very high level and we  exceeded market expectations. We achieved all of this despite growing headwinds from rising raw  material prices and in a market environment that remains volatile due  to the coronavirus pandemic. We were also able to maintain the supply of semiconductors in the  first quarter. As a result, there were no interruptions in production  during the reporting period. However, the situation remains difficult. Significantly improved pricing was a key driver for our strong Group  earnings. Additionally, the positive trend of the second half-year in  2020 continued during the first quarter in all major regions of the  world with over 636,000 vehicles delivered. In particular, our electrified vehicle fleet once again proved to be  an engine for growth. Our sales of electrified vehicles more than  doubled from the same period of last year to over 70,000 units (2020:  30,692, +129.8%). This means more than one in ten vehicles we sell is  already electrified. This underlines the high – and steadily growing –  importance of electromobility to our company. We took advantage of the past year to make ourselves more efficient  and more profitable for the long term. In addition to the better  pricing I mentioned before, this includes strict management of fixed  costs, a focus on controlling our inventory levels and cost-efficient  personnel structures. The company-wide Performance Programme continues to deliver important  contributions to sustainable earnings growth. Ladies and Gentlemen, All these factors are having a positive impact on our financial figures. Let’s now take a closer look at our financial performance. Group revenues for the first quarter of 2021 totalled around 26.8  billion euros (2020: 23.3 billion euros, +15.2%). Group earnings  before tax reached 3.76 billion euros (2020: 798 million euros) and  were therefore significantly higher than the previous year. The EBT  margin stood at 14%. The development in pre-owned car markets also contributed to the  margin increase through higher prices for the sale of end-of-lease vehicles. Manufacturing costs rose compared to the previous year, mainly driven  by the overall increase in sales volume and the growing share of  electrified vehicles. But also rising raw material prices contributed  to the increase. These increases, however, were partially offset by  lower risk provisioning. These results show that we remain on track with our transformation  process. Today’s profitability will secure our future competitiveness.  We continue to make systematic investments in important future areas  of activity, such as digitisation and electrification. This year  alone, two more all-electric vehicles will be released onto the  market: the BMW i4 and the BMW iX – important milestones in our  electromobility offensive. Research and development expenditure was almost on a par with last  year, at around 1.3 billion euros (2020: 1.34 billion euros/-2.8%).  Our R&D ratio of 4.8% was lower than in 2020, due to the company’s  high revenues (2020: 5.7%). The ratio of capitalised development costs  of 22.6% was also lower year-on-year (2020: 28.4%). The financial result of 732 million euros for the first quarter  climbed more than 1.3 billion euros from the same period of last year  (2020: -577 million euros). One the one hand, this was mainly due to  significantly higher earnings of 503 million euros from BMW Brilliance  Automotive, which had been heavily impacted in the previous year by  China's lockdown in response to the pandemic (2020: 162 million euros). On the other hand, the other financial result improved significantly  year-on-year to reach a total of 334 million euros. This was due in  particular to positive valuation effects compared to the previous year. Group liquidity increased to 20.1 billion euros in the first quarter  – reflecting the strong operating result and positive free cash flow  (2020: 17.8 billion euros). Over the coming months, we will bring  liquidity back within our target range of 17-18 billion euros.Ladies and Gentlemen, Let's move on to the segments, beginning with the Automotive Segment. The segment’s EBIT margin for the first quarter was 9.8% and  underlines the company’s excellent performance. The key drivers here were the improved pricing, the significant  increase in sales and higher aftersales revenues. Significant growth  was posted by all three BMW Group brands: BMW (+36.1%), MINI (+15.9%)  and Rolls Royce (+61.8%). Rolls-Royce had its best quarter ever,  selling a total of 1,380 automobiles. At BMW, in addition to the  electrified vehicles, the BMW X models were especially in demand, as  well as the BMW 3 Series and BMW 5 Series. The high earnings quality is also reflected in our strong free cash  flow of 2.52 billion euros (2020: -2.218 billion euros). A key driver, in addition to the significant increase in earnings  before tax, was the strict management of our working capital. The segment’s net financial assets rose significantly year-on-year to  21.3 billion euros (2020: 18.5 billion euros) due to the strong free  cash flow. Let’s turn now to the Financial Services Segment. This segment also got off to a good start this year, with around  489,000 new financing and leasing contracts concluded with retail  customers during the reporting period. This represents a solid  increase of 8.8% over the previous year (2020: 449,687 contracts). The recovery in new business with retail customers can be attributed  to significant growth in financing business (+15.2%). Segment earnings before tax increased significantly to 787 million  euros (2020: 484 million euros, +62.6%). The improved result was mostly due to the positive development of the  pre-owned vehicle markets, and the related improvement in the risk  situation for the Segment. In the prior-year quarter, additional risk provisioning for  anticipated credit and residual value risks was needed, due to the  uncertainty created by the pandemic. Credit losses remain at a low level. The Financial Services Segment makes comprehensive provisions for its  main business risks on an ongoing basis. Current assessments confirm that residual  value and credit risks are appropriately covered. The Motorcycles Segment successfully continued its growth strategy in  the first quarter. Over the past year, 13 new models were released  onto the market. During the reporting period, more than 42,500  motorcycles were delivered to customers. This is significantly more than in the same period of last year  (+22.5%). The EBIT margin in this segment was 17.9% (2020: 12.9%). Ladies and Gentlemen, Let's take a look at our guidance for the year. We made a strong start to 2021. Despite this, we expect to see  increasing volatility and we will continuously reassess the risk situation. The semiconductor supply situation will remain difficult, for  instance. Additional headwinds are also expected due to rising raw  material prices, particularly for rhodium and palladium and steel. The volatile situation continues to affect the BMW Group’s business performance. Based on current information, we are able to confirm our guidance for  2021. The following forecast for the main key figures does not take  into account possible effects in connection with the European  Commission’s ongoing antitrust proceedings. We expect to see a significant increase in Group pre-tax earnings  this year. The Automotive Segment should post a solid increase in the number of  BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles delivered to customers compared to  the previous year. We expect the EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment to be at the  higher end of our target range of 6 to 8%, with a significant increase  in RoCE for the automotive business. Our share of electrified vehicles in our deliveries will also  continue to increase over the course of the year. In the Financial Services Segment, we expect return on equity to be  at the higher end of our target range of 12 to 15%. In the Motorcycles Segment, we anticipate a solid increase in  deliveries. The EBIT margin should be within our target range of 8 to  10% and RoCE for the segment should also be significantly higher year-on-year. Now, let’s take a look at the non-financial indicators. The percentage of female managers at the BMW Group will increase  slightly in 2021, as planned. We will significantly reduce CO₂ emissions in our new vehicle fleet  once again, from today's adjusted benchmark. According to the  planning, CO2 emissions per vehicle produced are likely to fall moderately. Thanks to ongoing personnel restructuring measures, it should be  possible to achieve the above-mentioned goals with a slightly smaller  workforce size than the previous year. Ladies and Gentlemen, Our thinking and actions are always geared towards the long term. We  are setting the right course today to achieve our short, medium and  long-term goals. This applies, in particular, to our focus areas of  digitalisation, electrification, and sustainability. Our products are in demand and our operating business is performing  well. For the remainder of the year, we expect a free cash flow of  over four billion euros.We have the right strategy to successfully continue our  transformation process based on our high profitability. And, although  we expect the second half of the year to be more volatile, we are  optimistic about the future. Thank you for your attention. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Statement Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Conference Call Interim Report to 31 March 2021;Statement Zipse Conference Call Q1 2021;Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. The BMW Group is a global company.We leveraged this strategic strength both during the financial year  2020 and in the first quarter of 2021. When the market situation is difficult in individual regions of the  world, the other markets carry us through. Since the start of the pandemic, we have done everything possible to  create a safe working environment for our employees. We also offer  safe and contact-free delivery of vehicles to customers. In more than 60 markets we have set up Mobile Sales Offices. Our new  Customer, Brands and Sales System is taking advantage of the momentum  and growing acceptance of digital services that has been building over  the past year. Our strong results underline the viability of our business model –  even during one of the worst crises the global economy has faced. It  is robust, in demand all over the world and full of innovations. In many areas, we have picked up the pace once again. I would like to give you a brief overview, focusing on three main points:  Let's start with the first point. The BMW Group delivered excellent results in the first quarter of 2021.  This shows clearly: our strategy is having a real impact. The Automotive Segment delivered an EBIT margin of 9.8 percent in the  first quarter – back within our strategic medium-term target range for  the first time in ten quarters. As in the past, this EBIT margin does  not include the at-equity result from our BBA joint venture in China. Another indicator of our operating strength is our free cash flow of  2.5 billion euros in the Automotive Segment – our best figure ever for  a first quarter. Our first-quarter deliveries also reached a new all-time high.  Compared with the first quarter of 2019 – in other words, the  comparable period before the crisis – Group sales increased by six percent. Our total market share worldwide has climbed up to 3.3 percent –  from 2.9 percent in the same period 2019. Our performance in the Chinese market stands out, in particular.  Compared to the first quarter of 2019 – again, pre-crisis – our China  sales increased by more than 36 percent. We recently presented our model line-up for our largest market at  Auto Shanghai 2021. With highly innovative, digitalised, electric and,  above all, exceptionally high-quality products, like the BMW iX3, the  BMW iX and the BMW i4, we intend to sustain our growth in China. Our electrified models are also in high demand globally. In the first  quarter, we were the biggest manufacturer of plug-in hybrids worldwide. With more than 70,000 electrified vehicles sold in the first three  months of 2021, we are on track to have a total of one million  fully-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids on the roads by the end of  the year. This also illustrates the success of our flexible architecture strategy. The BMW iX3 is receiving consistently outstanding ratings from the  automotive press: not only because of its many impressive  characteristics – such as its quality, comfort, connectivity,  operating ease and dynamic performance – but also its range. Its efficient drive train puts it on a par with electric models with  the highest ranges among all brands within its segment. Just yesterday, I met with journalists testing pre-production models  of the BMW i4. This car will put e-mobility right at the heart of the  BMW brand. I am extremely confident we will be able to build on our e-mobility  successes with the BMW i4 and BMW iX. Growth remains our industry’s strongest currency. Before the end of the decade, we want to reach the milestone of three  million delivered vehicles annually. As far as the BMW Group is  concerned, we are also growing profitably and sustainably – and we  will make sure this continues. That brings me to my second point:We are growing sustainably. Sustainability is the new language that connects the world. The three major world markets, Europe, the US and China, as well as  other industrial nations, have set themselves ambitious goals on the  road to climate neutrality. They have recently confirmed – and even  stepped up – these targets. The next big, binding step will be the year 2030 – also for the BMW Group. We have geared our company entirely towards sustainability. By 2030,  we aim to reduce our actual carbon footprint per vehicle by at least a  third from 2019 levels – in a verifiable and transparent manner,  everywhere around the world. During our Annual Conference, we published an integrated BMW Group  Report for the first time, which documents our progress and, most  importantly, gives equal weighting to our sustainable development and  financial indicators. A company does not become sustainable simply by flipping a switch or  buying certificates. What counts is not alleged sustainability – but  verifiable measures that deliver a real impact. That is why we joined the Science Based Targets Initiative. We think about sustainability in a way that goes far beyond emissions. Energy and resource consumption will be the next, much bigger issue.Raw materials are becoming more expensive. Water and many mineral  resources are scarce and valuable commodities. We are seeing that especially right now. This is why it is so  important to think in terms of a circular model and reduce our use of  materials from the outset. To achieve this, we are relying on partnerships and collaboration  across our industry, with NGOs as well as political institutions.This requires hard work, investment and an ongoing commitment.We firmly believe: we will add value for society in this way, and  also become a stronger company in the long term.  Let me give you a few examples from the last few months alone:        All these examples show that:Sustainability cannot be taken for granted. It takes a lot of  different measures to achieve a large-scale effect – as well as a  conscious openness towards choosing the most effective technology in  each case. Our ambition is clear:The greenest electric car will be a BMW. However, we also know that we always have to – and we will – combine  sustainability with technology, innovation and inspiring products for  our customers. That is the BMW way. And we will continue full speed ahead. That brings me to my third and final point: We are shaping the technology for tomorrow’s mobility.    We are electrifying all our brands to achieve this.    We will also be introducing our new and self-developed BMW Operating  System 8 with the BMW iX: a new generation of performance, user  experience and intelligent driver assistance. In combination with high-performance hardware, we are capable of  processing more data live than ever before. The data transfer is 10 to  20 times faster than in previous systems.We have also enhanced our award-winning and safe display and  operating concept.  BMW Operating System 8 is designed for 5G connectivity, with complete  functionality for applications like our powerful cloud-based  navigation software BMW Maps.  Third-party services can be fully integrated into the operating  system. This applies, for instance, to services from Apple,  Google, Tencent and Spotify, which can transform the vehicle into the  perfect digital companion. We already introduced over-the-air updates for our vehicles with  BMW Operating System 7. More than one million vehicles have already  received upgrades. This was a huge success that we will continue to build on. In many  cases, our vehicles can be configured with functions on demand at a  later date. By the end of the year, we will have the largest connected fleet in  the world, with around 2.5 million vehicles with Remote Software  Upgrade capabilities. And we are already planning the next big step. At the Annual Conference, we unveiled the broad strokes of our  vehicle strategy from the middle of the decade:the Neue Klasse – electric, digital and circular. It will be key to the future success of the BMW Group. We are putting  all our know-how and considerable investment into this development. The Neue Klasse will establish a new generation of technology modules  – targeting maximum synergies and scalability for our entire vehicle portfolio. We will be introducing a new digital architecture and a new  generation of electrical system. We will also be taking the next leap with our electric powertrain and  leveraging the opportunities of the new architecture to redesign our  batteries. At our Battery Cell Competence Centre, we are currently  testing different cell chemistries, formats and modules. We aim to realise an automotive-compatible solid-state battery in  collaboration with the battery specialist Solid Power by the end of  the decade. We will present an initial demonstrator vehicle with these  batteries well before 2025. Ladies and Gentlemen, The BMW Group is on course for success. We are growing and reaching more customers than ever. We are  focused on our goal of reaching three million units sold in a single  financial year within this decade. In recent years, we have been working hard to get back on a  profitable track. Today, we are seeing the benefits of this strategy. We are setting the standard with our sustainable global business model.We will eliminate mobility as a climate factor in the long term – by  implementing impactful and transparent measures in the BMW style. And we are paving the way for the next leaps in technology – that  will inspire our customers even ten years from now. Thank you for your attention. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

First quarter: Transformation accelerated – core business significantly strengthened;"Zipse: ""BMW Group highly profitable and sustainable""  Deliveries of electrified vehicles more than doubled  Free cash flow of € 2.5 billion in first quarter  Sustainable mobility needs more than just an e-drive  Earnings boosted by higher deliveries and better pricing  Automotive segment EBIT margin at 9.8%  ";"Munich. The BMW Group continued to grow extremely  dynamically in the first quarter 2021 – as demonstrated by its  outstanding reported figures. The Group is systematically driving its  transformation process at a high pace, reaching new milestones in  terms of e-mobility, digitisation and sustainability. At the same  time, it was able to strengthen its business model in the first  quarter of the year and to grow further. ""The first quarter shows that our global business model is a  successful one, even in times of crisis. We remain firmly on track for  continued sustainable, profitable growth,"" said Oliver    Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, in  Munich on Friday. ""Our strategy is based on retaining a keen  focus on providing attractive high-tech products that are destined to  shape the changing world of mobility going forward. With this clear  vision, we are already developing the next major technological leaps  that will continue to fascinate our customers ten years from now."" The main thrust of the Group's work is on digitally    connected, sustainable electric mobility. The    breakthrough of e-mobility has been expedited by  the holistic approach adopted by the BMW Group, driven in particular  by the systematic addition of electrified drivetrain technologies to  its model portfolio and the target of increasing its sales of    fully electric vehicles by an average of more than 50 per  cent per year through to 2025. By then, the BMW Group  plans to have some two million fully electric  vehicles on roads worldwide, also putting it firmly on track  from a strategic perspective to achieve the    EU's ambitious decarbonisation targets by 2030. As part of this strategy, the BMW Group is keen to play a leading  role in the development of battery technology. Within  the framework of its second EU-coordinated ‘IPCEI’ project  (‘Important Project of Common European Interest’), the focus  is on developing the next generation of lithium-ion battery cells. The  all-solid-state battery (ASSB) for automobiles is expected to be more  cost-effective, more sustainable and optimised for the    circular reuse of raw materials to take account of  the increasingly limited availability of natural resources worldwide.  After their deployment in vehicles, the intention is to use the  batteries as stationary storage devices, with the ultimate aim of  processing all their raw materials for subsequent reuse. The second  IPCEI project also promotes the continued development of process  technologies and the construction of a prototype production plant for  innovative battery modules and systems. The BMW Group recently signed  an agreement with the US company Solid Power for the  industrialisation of new solid-state batteries. As part of a pilot  project, the latter will supply solid-state battery cells with a  higher capacity of 100 Ah already from 2022 onwards. By adopting this sustainable reuse approach, the BMW Group intends to  make a valuable contribution to preserving limited natural  resources. Circularity is also a proactive way of  counteracting price hikes of scarce commodities going forward.""This example of combatting resource scarcity clearly shows how  sustainability has economic as well as ecological benefits and  validates the comprehensive approach to sustainability applied  throughout the enterprise,"" stated Oliver Zipse. At the same time, the BMW Group is also extensively involved in    expanding public and private charging  infrastructures. Since 2013, it has participated in some 50  international projects with various partners, jointly installing over    15,000 public charging points. By mid-year, it will  have established around 4,100 charging points for its own employees in  parking areas at various Group locations, around half of which will be  accessible to the general public, all powered fully by electricity  from renewable sources. The BMW Group is also fostering the rapid expansion of and ubiquitous  access to an open charging infrastructure in Europe in the form of a  recently agreed collaboration of the YOUR NOW subsidiary    CHARGE NOW with the energy company bp (formerly: BP British  Petroleum). With the same objective in mind, the BMW Group is also a    co-founder and partner of Ionity and its high-power charging  network. So far, Ionity has set up around 350 charging  stations across Europe, with the number expected to rise to over 400  by the end of the year. These charging facilities each provide an  average of four fast-charging points and are conveniently located on  motorways and main traffic routes. The all-electric  BMW iX3*, for instance, can be recharged    within 10 minutes for a range of up to 100 km (WLTP) at one  of these fast-charging points. The Ionity network is due to be  successively expanded, also within towns and cities. The BMW Group’s mission to build the ‘greenest’ electric car has been  furthered by its involvement in a number of projects during the past quarter. For example, it has concluded multi-year supply agreements with the  US company Livent to purchase sustainable lithium  sourced from South America. Livent utilises a special process that  reduces the impact of lithium extraction on the surrounding ecosystem  to a minimum. With immediate effect, one half of the aluminium required by the  light metal foundry in Landshut will be supplied by the Abu  Dhabi-based company Emirates Global Aluminium. The  raw material is produced using electricity generated by one of the  world's largest solar farms.The BMW Group also has a stake in Boston Metal, a  company that aims to make steel production more sustainable. Boston  Metal is working on industrialising low-emission electrolysis  processes for producing liquid iron. In collaboration with the WWF (World Wide Fund For Nature), Google,  Samsung SDI and Volvo, the BMW Group has launched an    initiative to protect the deep seas. Accordingly,  the practise of extracting minerals from deep-sea mining is considered  taboo as long as the consequences have not been comprehensively  scientifically investigated. World's largest fleet capable of over-the-air upgrades set to    be on roads by end of 2021Apart from the electric drivetrain itself, other crucial factors  driving the transformation process include software systems    and their digital interaction with the vehicle.Since 2014, customers have been able to book and pay for services  online directly from the vehicle via the BMW Connected  Drive Store. Moreover, since 2018, BMW drivers have been able  to keep vehicle connectivity up to date at all times with the help of    remote software upgrades, much like they have  already become used to doing with their smartphones. By the end of  2021, the BMW Group will already have the world's largest  fleet on the road, with around 2.5 million vehicles that can  be updated with new and enhanced functions over the air. The BMW iX* will be the first vehicle to feature the  new BMW Operating System 8 − the most powerful data  processing system devised for cars to date − enabling high-speed    over-the-air upgrades, which will provide an even  broader range of functions on demand that can be  ordered and installed over the air at any time with complete flexibility. BMW Group on growth course in first quarter Compared to the previous year's pandemic-affected first-quarter  performance, key financial figures developed positively in the first  three months of the financial year 2021. The significant recovery of  the markets, which began in mid-2020, continued to gain momentum  during the first three months of the year. Within a favourable  environment, the BMW Group set a new record for first-quarter  deliveries with an increase of 33.4% compared to the previous year to  636,606 units (2020: 477,111 units). Sales of electrified vehicles more than doubled in the first    quarter Strong demand forelectrified vehicles (plug-in hybrids and fully  electric vehicles) contributed substantially to the outstanding sales  performance, with deliveries more than doubling compared to the same  quarter one year earlier.This dynamic growth rate is testimony to the success of the BMW  Group’s electrification strategy, with a total of 70,207    electrified vehicles delivered to customers during the  three-month period (2020: 30,692 units"; +18.9% adjusted for currency factors). The Group's research and development expenditure  totalled € 1,287 million (2020: € 1,324 million;  -2.8%), slightly lower than one year earlier, with costs arising in  the first quarter 2021 primarily for electrification and digitisation  as well as for preparing the production ramp-up of the BMW iX*. The  increase in revenues caused the R&D ratio to fall    to 4.8% (2020: 5.7%). At 22.6%,  the capitalisation rate was also lower than one year  earlier (2020: 28.4%). In light of the various positive effects described above,    Group profit before financial result for the  three-month period rose significantly to € 3,025 million (2020: € 1,375 million;" +120%). The improved financial result also contributed to  earnings growth. In particular, the Group’s share of the profit in the  Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive amounting to € 503  million (2020: € 162 million) as well as positive valuation effects  arising on interest rate hedges and individual investments gave rise  to a significant improvement in the first-quarter financial  result, which turned around from a net negative amount of  € 577 million to a net positive amount of € 732 million. Group profit before tax improved to € 3,757  million (2020: € 798 million). The EBT  margin for the Group came in at 14.0% (2020:  3.4%). Group net profit amounted to € 2,833  million (2020: € 574 million). """"Profitability is a key aspect of our transformation journey.  Our operational strength enables us to manage the move towards a world  of digitally connected, sustainable mobility. With this aim in mind,  we are investing specifically in low-emission drivetrain systems and  attractive, highly innovative products and equipment. Furthermore, we  continue to streamline our processes and structures in order to boost  performance,"""" said Dr Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board    of Management of BMW AG, Finance in Munich on Friday. Dynamic sales growth for all Group brands Higher sales volume in the first quarter 2021 resulted in  corresponding increases in Automotive segment revenues and earnings.Worldwide deliveries of BMW brand vehicles totalled    560,543 units (2020: 411,809 units"; +36.1%). The  figure included excellent contributions from the highly successful BMW  5 Series and BMW 3 Series, both of which recorded year-on-year growth  of more than 40%. The popular X-family models were also in high demand  during the three-month period.At 74,683 units, MINI brand sales  were 16% higher than one year earlier (2020: 64,449 units; +15.9%).  Demand for the MINI Countryman was extremely high, with deliveries up  by more than one third (+35.9%) as well as for the John Cooper Works  models (+20.5%) with their sporty flair.Rolls-Royce Motor Cars delivered 1,380    ultra-luxury automobiles to customers, the highest number  ever achieved in a single quarter (2020: 853 units; +61.8%), with  China, the USA and the Asia-Pacific region the biggest contributors to  this growth. Deliveries up in all major regions of the worldIn Europe, the number of vehicles delivered by the  BMW Group rose by a solid 8.1% to 239,018 units  (2020: 221,024 units) despite the adverse effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Customers in Germany took delivery of 62,696  units (2020: 66,004 units; -5.0%) and customers in the UK42,413units (2020: 44,474 units; -4.6%). In other countries  and regions of Europe such as France, Italy and northern Europe, the  BMW Group recorded double-digit sales volume growth year on year. Deliveries to customers in the Americas region rose  to 96,352 units (2020: 82,078 units; +17.4%) as  markets continued to pick up, most notably in the  USA, where sales were up by more than one fifth to    78,067 units (2020: 64,956 units; +20.2%). In Asia, the BMW Group delivered a total of    287,697 units, up by 77% on the same quarter last  year and a new all-time high (2020: 162,940 units; +76.6%). Sales  figures for China nearly doubled year-on-year,  jumping by 98% to 230,193 units (2020: 116,577 units;  +97.5%), partly reflecting the weaker performance one year earlier. Automotive segment records high revenue growthSegment revenues totalled € 22,762  million in the first quarter (2020: € 17,989 million; +26.5%,  currency-adjusted +30.4%), driven primarily by the continued upward  trend in sales volume. In addition, positive product mix effects due  to higher sales of the X5 and X6, among other models, as well as  improved price penetration boosted revenues. Revenues generated with  the Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive also rose year-on-year. Segment EBIT amounted to € 2,236  million (2020: € 229 million) and segmentprofit before tax to € 2,776 million  (2020: € 80 million). The EBIT margin came in at  9.8% and therefore within the defined long-term  target range (2020: 1.3%).Free cash flow generated by the Automotive segment increased to €  2,522 million, mainly reflecting improved earnings before tax and  continued rigorous working capital management. Financial Services: solid increase in new business with retail customersIn total, 489,066 new credit financing and leasing  contracts were signed with retail customers during the first  quarter 2021, up by a solid 8.8% compared to one year earlier (2020:  449,687 contracts), mainly due to the sharp rise in credit financing  business (+15.2%), particularly in China. The total volume of    new credit financing and leasing contracts concluded with  retail customers increased by 9.1% to  € 15,351 million (2020: € 14,075 million). Significant improvement in Financial Services segment earningsRevenues generated by the FinancialServices segment in the first quarter increased  slightly to € 7,906 million (2020: € 7,598 million;  +4.1%) due to positive effects from business with end-of-contract  leasing vehicles. Earnings improved at an even more pronounced rate, largely thanks to  the improved risk situation on the one hand and higher marketing  revenues from the sale of returned lease vehicles on the other,  particularly on the US market, with segment profit before  tax rising to € 787 million (2020: € 484  million; +62.6%). The Financial Services segment makes provision on an  ongoing and comprehensive basis to take account of significant  business risks. Current assessments confirm that residual value and  credit risks are appropriately covered. Remainder of year expected to remain volatile The coronavirus pandemic will continue to influence the course of  business for the BMW Group throughout the current financial year −  both directly and indirectly. Vaccination measures being taken  worldwide should, however, have a positive effect on the situation and  increasingly reduce the adverse impact of the pandemic on global  economic growth. Nevertheless, negative consequences for the BMW Group  cannot be ruled out in the further course of the year. Furthermore,  rising raw materials prices could have a dampening impact on earnings  going forward. In light of the current dynamic environment, the  BMW Group reaffirms its outlook for the full year, expecting business  performance continuing to develop positively. New models and digital  services covering various aspects of individual mobility are likely to  ensure that demand remains buoyant. Group profit before tax is  therefore predicted to rise significantly during the outlook period. The Automotive segment is expected to record a solid  year-on-year increase in the number of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand  vehicles delivered to customers. The segment’s EBIT margin is set to  improve significantly on the previous year's figure and come in at the  upper end of the forecast range between 6 and 8%, with segment RoCE  therefore also improving significantly. Segment free cash flow is  likely to exceed € 4 billion over the year as a whole.In the Financial Services segment, the Return on  Equity (RoE) is forecast to come in at the upper end of the range  between 12 and 15%. The Motorcycles segment is expected to record a  solid increase in deliveries to customers. The EBIT margin is  predicted to lie within a target range of 8 to 10%, enabling the  segment to record a significantly higher level of RoCE than one year earlier. The BMW Group also reaffirms its forecast for non-financial    performance indicators. Accordingly, the proportion of  women in management functions is expected to increase slightly. At the  same time, the BMW Group is targeting a further significant reduction  in the carbon emissions generated by its new vehicle fleet. According  to current forecasts, carbon emissions per vehicle produced are likely  to fall moderately. The Group's targets for the year are to be met with a    slightly smaller workforce. Ongoing uncertainty –  particularly regarding the further course of the corona pandemic,  macroeconomic and political developments as well as international  trade and customs policies – could have a negative impact on economic  conditions in many regions. These eventualities could hold down growth  and thereby have a further significant impact on the business  performance of the BMW Group. The BMW Group – an overview1st quarter20211st quarter2020Change in %Deliveries to customersAutomobiles1units636,606477,11133.4thereof:         BMW1units560,543411,80936.1 MINI1units74,68364,44915.9 Rolls-Royce1units1,38085361.8Motorcyclesunits42,59234,77422.5     Employees                                         (as          of 31.12.2020)120,726 -4.22 Automotive segment          EBIT margin%9.81.38.5 % pointsMotorcycles          segment EBIT margin%17.912.95 % pointsPre-tax return on sales3%14.03.410.6 % points     Revenues€ million26,77823,25215.2thereof:        Automotive€ million22,76217,98926.5Motorcycles€ million75355735.2Financial        Services€ million7,9067,5984.1Other        Entities€ million11-Eliminations€ million-4,644-2,89360.5     Profit before financial result        (EBIT)€ million3,0251,375120.0thereof:        Automotive€ million2,236229-Motorcycles€ million1357287.5Financial        Services€ million76754241.5Other        Entities€ million-612-Eliminations€ million-107520-     Profit before tax (EBT)€ million3,757798-thereof:        Automotive€ million2,77680-Motorcycles€ million1357287.5Financial        Services€ million78748462.6Other        Entities€ million141-344-Eliminations€ million-82506-     Group income taxes€ million-924-224-Group net profit€ million2,833574-Earnings per share(common/preferred share) €4.26/4.260.84/0.84-/-1In connection with a review of its sales practices and  related reporting practices, the BMW Group has examined prior-period  vehicle delivery data and ascertained that certain vehicle deliveries  were not reported in the correct periods.

Four BMW M 1000 RRs at MotorLand Aragón: BMW Motorrad Motorsport enters the crucial phase of preparations ahead of the 2021 WorldSBK.;With two weeks to go until the start of the 2021 season in the FIM FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad Motorsport has entered a crucial phase of preparations. MotorLand Aragón, the Spanish circuit that will host the opening races of the year, was the venue for this week’s intensive tests with the new BMW M 1000 RR.;Alcañiz. With two weeks to go until the start of the 2021    season in the FIM FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW    Motorrad Motorsport has entered a crucial phase of preparations.    MotorLand Aragón, the Spanish circuit that will host the opening    races of the year, was the venue for this week’s intensive tests    with the new BMW M 1000 RR. Among those attending were the factory    team, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, with riders Tom Sykes (GBR)    and Michael van der Mark (NED), as well as the two BMW satellite    teams: Bonovo MGM Racing with Jonas Folger (GER) and RC Squadra    Corse with Eugene Laverty (IRL). The test was primarily used to test further developments and  fine-tune the bikes to the individual needs of the riders ahead of the  start of the season. Working closely together, and blessed with ideal  conditions in the Spanish sun, the teams and riders gained a lot of  valuable information for their final preparations. WorldSBK kicks off the 2021 season with a double-header. The action  takes place from 21st to 23rd May at MotorLand Aragón. Round two of  the season follows just one week later (28th to 30th May), at Estoril, Portugal. Quotes after the test at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It  was the last test before it really gets serious – on this same track.  Again, we had productive days under perfect weather conditions without  any large technical issues so we could clearly conduct our test plan.  Already, the satellite teams have shown added value for us because we  can get more confirmation and we can share the test points so we can  get through more work. That is very positive, we still have some  homework to do before the first race but I am confident we will get  there and already in some areas it’s a clear improvement, like top  speed, brakes and so on. Overall I am happy and I am very much looking  forward to finally race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK  Team: “It was good to get to the final test in pre-season  preparation at Aragón. We again had good conditions. I think we have  been very fortunate this year with the late start of the season and  selecting to start our testing late has paid dividends. On track  activities - we have been focusing on chassis and electronic work. I  think it is fair to say that we have completed most of that;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW Blends Art and Artificial Intelligence to Create “The Ultimate AI Masterpiece.”   Frieze New York taking place at The Shed from May 5-9, 2021.;BMW debuted today the “The Ultimate AI Masterpiece,” a unique exploration of art and technology that uses artificial intelligence to generate entirely new works. The virtual art installation premieres in conjunction with Frieze New York 2021, as well as the 50th anniversary of BMW Group Cultural Engagement. ;BMW debuted today the “The Ultimate AI Masterpiece,” a unique  exploration of art and technology that uses artificial intelligence to  generate entirely new works. The virtual art installation premieres in  conjunction with Frieze New York 2021, as well as the 50th  anniversary of BMW Group Cultural Engagement. Content and videos  documenting its creation process are available today online via www.bmw.com“The Ultimate AI Masterpiece” virtual art installation was created in  partnership with creative technologist Nathan Shipley of Goodby,  Silverstein & Partners, and Gary Yeh, Art Collector & Founder  of ArtDrunk. The duo leveraged Nvidia’s open source “StyleGAN”  artificial intelligence software to cross-reference over 50,000 images  of artwork spanning 900 years of art history and a curated set of 50  works from renowned and emerging contemporary artists BMW has worked  with over the past 50 years. Using these inputs as a basis for  understanding art, the artificial intelligence then generates entirely  new works of art, merging what it learned from classical art and the  styles noted from the contemporary artists. These new works have been  projection-mapped onto a virtual rendition of BMW’s range-topping 8  Series Gran Coupe.“For 50 years, BMW has supported the arts and culture through  numerous initiatives as a way to engage and interact with consumers  around the world in an authentic way,” said Uwe Dreher, vice president  of marketing, BMW of North America.  “As we continue these efforts  into 2021 and look for new and creative ways to engage audiences, we  shift to a virtual setting where we are combining centuries-old art  and the latest AI technology to create something completely new and exciting.”To document the creative process behind the virtual installation,  Shipley and Yeh collaborated digitally from different parts of the  world – Yeh in Seoul, Shipley in San Francisco – and virtually joined  each other for an engaging conversation on the technology behind the  artwork created by the AI, as well as BMW’s decades-long support of  the arts. “The Ultimate AI Masterpiece” documentary video is available  at www.bmw.com“AI is an emerging medium of creative expression. It’s a fascinating  space where art meets algorithm,” said Nathan Shipley. “Combining the  historical works with the curated modern works and projecting the  evolving images onto the 8 Series Gran Coupe serves a direct nod to  BMW’s history of uniting automobiles, art, and technology.”“During an unusually isolated time in history, we took the  opportunity to curate and work with artists from around the world as a  means to give viewers a true art experience digitally,” said Gary Yeh.  “It was particularly exciting to push the boundaries of art, see how  technology may influence the art world in the years to come, and build  on 50 years of cultural engagement at BMW.”Today, BMW is committed to cultural engagement around the world and  takes its social responsibility seriously as a corporate citizen. Over  a hundred long-term cultural initiatives in the fields of modern and  contemporary art, classical music, jazz and sound as well as in  architecture and design have been well established throughout the  decades. Together with other partners, the BMW Group developed its own  range of partnerships and activations with renowned artists,  musicians, designers, curators, initiatives including the BMW  Guggenheim Lab, BMW Tate Live, BMW Open Work by Frieze, the BMW Welt  Jazz Award, the BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors, the BMW Art  Journey and the free concert series Opera for all in Berlin, Munich,  Moscow and London.From May 5-9, 2021, Frieze New York runs its tenth edition, taking  place for the first time at The Shed in Manhattan. Reimagined for its  new location, the fair brings together over 60 major galleries and  sees a strong representation from New York, celebrating the creative  spirit of the city. A dedicated edition of Frieze Viewing Room will  run parallel to the fair, through May 14, and will feature an expanded  list of over 160 exhibitors, connecting international galleries and  audiences unable to travel. As official automotive partner, BMW will  provide dedicated shuttle vehicles for VIP guests.Visitors to Frieze can also explore the latest work of artist  collective Random International “Body / Light” presented by Arts  Brookfield and Superblue at Manhatten West, in walking distance from  the fair. The work is inspired by a year-long collaboration with BMW i  and the precise, minimalist culture of their design group as well as  the technologies enabling the electrification of mobility.

Versatile, stylish and sustainable on tour: the MINI Electric with MINI Genuine Accessories.;With optional roof rails and a wide range of retrofit products for the exterior and interior, the first purely electrically powered model from the British premium brand also becomes the perfect companion for active leisure activities and excursions into nature. ;Munich. The temperatures are rising and with them the  anticipation of outdoor activities and excursions into nature. The  model-specific railing and roof rack systems from the MINI Genuine  Accessories range create ideal conditions for leaving the limits of  urban mobility behind and combining driving pleasure with active  leisure activities. The MINI Cooper SE (combined power consumption:  17.6 - 15.2 kWh/100 km according to WLTP, 16.9 - 14.9 kWh/100 km  according to NEDC) is a particularly sustainable escape from everyday  life. The MINI Cooper SE is the only fully electric model in its competitive    class, that can be equipped with optional roof rails and a wide    range of retrofit products. This means that nothing stands in  the way of locally emission-free transport of roof boxes, bicycles or  other sports and leisure utensils.With a range of 203 to 234 kilometres determined in the WLTP test  cycle, the MINI Cooper SE is ideally equipped to explore new routes  away from the urban jungle. And when it comes to versatility and  transport capacities, the first purely electrically powered model from  the British premium brand is in no way inferior to the conventionally  powered variants of the MINI 3-door. With all four seats utilised, its  luggage compartment volume is also 211 litres. And after folding down  the rear seat backrest, which can be divided in a 60 : 40 ratio, the  storage space increases to 731 litres, just like in a MINI 3-door with  an internal combustion engine. And that's not all: the railing and  roof rack systems from the MINI Genuine Accessories range turn the  electrified model into a versatile transport talent in no time at all.The conditions for this are created by the roof rails in matt black,  which are available directly from production site. On the roof of the  MINI Cooper SE, it forms the stable basis for various fastening and  transport systems, which are available in the MINI Genuine Accessories  range for both the MINI Cooper SE and the conventionally powered MINI  3-door and MINI 5-door models. For example, the railing rack available  there as a retrofit product enables the MINI roof box to be locked in  place comfortably and securely. With a tare weight of 13 kilograms, it  offers a capacity of 320 litres. This provides sufficient space for  sports clothing, bicycle helmets or even camping and picnic equipment.  Even skis can be stored in the roof box, which is around 1.90 metres  long. The all-black box has embossed stripes and MINI lettering. It is  lockable and can be opened on both sides.Because the brand's typical principle of creative use of space also  applies to the roof of the MINI Cooper SE, there is even room for a  bicycle next to the roof box. With the touring bike holder, which is  also available in the MINI Genuine Accessories range, two-wheelers of  different types and sizes can be mounted upright and securely on the  railing carrier. The holder made of high-strength aluminum fixes the  bike with a lockable clamping system and two tension straps. In  addition, the range includes other transport solutions such as ski  racks and an aluminum luggage basket, which are also compatible with  the railing carrier.The MINI Cooper SE becomes the ideal companion for a short trip or  weekend excursion with the model-specific Travel & Comfort System.

BMW Group Strengthens Leadership Position in Battery Technology with Investment in Solid-State Innovator Solid Power;Taking a successful Joint Development effort to the next level  20 ampere hour (Ah) multi-layer all solid-state batteries in production  100 Ah cells for automotive vehicle integration in 2022  Automotive-compatible all solid-state battery by the end of the decade – BMW demonstrator vehicle well before 2025 ;" ### Start of joint Press Release from all partners involved ### Louisville, Colorado, USA. Solid Power, an  industry-leading producer of all solid-state batteries for electric  vehicles, today announced a $130 million Series B investment round led  by the BMW Group, Ford Motor Company and Volta Energy Technologies.  Ford and the BMW Group have also expanded existing joint development  agreements with Solid Power to secure all solid-state batteries for  future electric vehicles. The investment positions Solid Power to produce full-scale automotive  batteries, increase associated material output and expand in-house  production capabilities for future vehicle integration. The BMW Group  and Ford aim to utilize Solid Power’s low-cost, high-energy all  solid-state battery technology in forthcoming electric vehicles. “BMW and Ford now share leading positions in the race for solid-state  battery-powered electric vehicles,” said Doug Campbell, CEO and  co-founder of Solid Power. “Solid Power now plans to begin producing  automotive-scale batteries on the company’s pilot production line in  early 2022 as a result of our partners’ continued commitment to Solid  Power’s commercialization efforts.” Solid Power has demonstrated its ability to produce and scale  next-generation all solid-state batteries that are designed to power  longer range, lower cost and safer electric vehicles using existing  lithium-ion battery manufacturing infrastructure. Solid Power’s leadership in all solid-state battery development and  manufacturing has been confirmed with the delivery of hundreds of  production line-produced battery cells that were validated by Ford and  BMW Group late last year, formalizing Solid Power’s commercialization  plans with its two long-standing automotive partners.  “Solid-state battery technology is important to the future of  electric vehicles, and that’s why we’re investing directly,” said Ted  Miller, Ford’s manager of Electrification Subsystems and Power Supply  Research. “By simplifying the design of solid-state versus lithium-ion  batteries, we’ll be able to increase vehicle range, improve interior  space and cargo volume, deliver lower costs and better value for  customers and more efficiently integrate this kind of solid-state  battery cell technology into existing lithium-ion cell production processes.” “Being a leader in advanced battery technology is of the utmost  importance for the BMW Group. The development of all solid-state  batteries is one of the most promising and important steps towards  more efficient, sustainable, and safer electric vehicles. We now have  taken our next step on this path with Solid Power,” said Frank Weber,  Member of the Board of Management BMW AG, Development. “Together we  have developed a 20 Ah all solid-state cell that is absolutely  outstanding in this field. Over the past 10 years BMW has continuously  increased the battery cell competence– important partners like Solid  Power share our vision of a zero-emission mobility.” Solid Power is currently producing 20 ampere hour (Ah) multi-layer  all solid-state batteries on the company's continuous roll-to-roll  production line, which exclusively utilizes industry standard  lithium-ion production processes and equipment. Both Ford and the BMW Group will receive full-scale 100 Ah cells for  automotive qualification testing and vehicle integration beginning in  2022. Solid Power’s all solid-state platform technology allows for the  production of unique cell designs expected to meet performance  requirements for each automotive partner. Solid Power’s truly  all-solid cell designs achieve higher energy densities, are safer and  are expected to cost less than today’s best-performing lithium-ion  battery cells. “Volta invested early in Solid Power when our team of energy and  commercialization experts found they had not only promising  technology, but also a fundamental focus on manufacturability. After  all, a breakthrough battery will not find a place in the market if it  can't be produced at scale with acceptable costs,” said Dr. Jeff  Chamberlain, CEO of Volta Energy Technologies, a venture capital firm  spun out of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National  Laboratory focused on investing in breakthrough energy storage and  battery innovations. “The fact that Solid Power is already producing  multi-layer all solid-state batteries using industry-standard  automated commercial manufacturing equipment is why Volta is excited  to ramp up its earlier investment. The company's partnership with BMW  and Ford will further accelerate the full commercialization of Solid  Power’s batteries and position both car companies to be among the  first to have EVs on the road powered by safer, affordable,  high-energy solid-state batteries.”                    ### end of joint Press Release from all partners  involved ### For the BMW Group, it is clear that high-performance and sustainable  energy storage systems are the key success factor for the individual  mobility of the future. The development of highly innovative and  sustainable battery cells is therefore one key element of the next  phase of transformation of the BMW Group. The BMW Group is accelerating its development for the battery  technology of the future: This goal is also reflected in the Neue  Klasse, which the BMW Group first presented at its annual conference  in March. This new generation of vehicles, which will be launched by  the middle of this decade, will be uncompromisingly electric, digital,  circular – and clearly focused on all-electric drivetrains. With the Neue Klasse, the BMW Group aims at the level of  state-of-the-art internal combustion engines in terms of range and  manufacturing costs. Therefore, electric mobility ""engineered by  BMW"" is intended to appeal to and convince new groups of buyers  worldwide. For this sixth generation of BMW e‑drive technology,  featuring the next level of Lithium-Ion batteries, the company  evaluates correspondingly different cell formats, cell chemistry and  also cell modules in the current development phase. A key goal is to  create truly green, low-carbon and recyclable batteries. Solid-state battery for serial use – demonstrator vehicle well    before 2025However, the BMW Group with its extensive in-house expertise in the  complete value chain of electric drive for years, is already planning  further into the future beyond this next generation:By the end of the decade, the energy density of battery cells is  expected to increase by at least a mid-double-digit percentage range –  from an already high level today.The battery cell of the future will be powerful, safe,  cost-effective, and recyclable - from material selection to  recyclability after the use in the vehicle. For the end of the decade  the BMW Group has announced an automotive-compatible all solid-state  battery for series production. A first demonstrator vehicle featuring  this technology will be on the road well before 2025. Electric offensive in full swing Thanks to intelligent vehicle architectures and a highly flexible  production network, the BMW Group will have around a dozen  all-electric models on the road as early as 2023.In addition to the BMW i3*, MINI Cooper SE* and BMW iX3*, which are  already on the market, two key innovation drivers, the BMW i4* and the  BMW iX* will be put on the road this year– the BMW i4 even three  months earlier than originally planned.In the coming years, all-electric versions of the high-volume BMW 5  Series and the BMW X1 will follow. In addition, there will be an  all-electric BMW 7 Series as well as the successor to the MINI  Countryman and other models. As early as 2023, the BMW Group will have  at least one all-electric model on the road in around 90 percent of  its current market segments.By 2025, the BMW Group will increase sales of all-electric models by  an average of significantly more than 50 percent per year – more than  ten times more than in 2020. In total, the company will have delivered  around two million all-electric vehicles to customers by the end of 2025.Based on current market expectations, the BMW Group is planning that  by 2030 at least 50 percent of its global sales will consist of  all-electric vehicles. In total, the company will bring about ten  million all-electric vehicles onto the road over the approximately  next ten years. This also means that the BMW Group is strategically on  target of achieving the EU's ambitious CO2 reduction targets in 2025  and 2030.The investment in Solid Power again demonstrates the BMW Group´s  capability to identify the leading tech start-ups and to join forces  on the way to achieve pathbreaking next generation technology. Various  BMW Technology scouting offices around the world, outstanding startup  accelerators, the BMW Startup Garage and BMW i Ventures, are always on  the lookout for leading edge or disruptive tech in an increasingly  competitive ecosystem. As a result, BMW sets the standard for  successful start-up collaboration, venture funding and corporate investment.In the event of enquiries please contact: Corporate Communications Bernhard Ederer, BMW Group Innovation CommunicationsTel.: +49  (0) 176 601 28556, e-mail: bernhard.ederer@bmwgroup.comMax-Morten Borgmann, BMW Group Corporate  CommunicationsTel: +49 89 382-24118, e-mail: max-morten.borgmann@bmwgroup.comBenjamin Titz, Head of BMW Group Design, Innovation &  Motorsport CommunicationsTel.: +49 (0)179 – 743 80 88, e-mail: benjamin.titz@bmw.de Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail: presse@bmwgroup.com   The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Innovation driver for hydrogen technology and tomorrow’s sustainable CO2-free mobility; Bavarian Economic Affairs Minister Hubert Aiwanger and BMW Group Board of Management Member Dr Andreas Wendt impressed by Landshut Lightweight Construction and Technology Centre’s expertise in manufacturing components for hydrogen propulsion  Innovative capabilities and industrialisation expertise showcased in small series of BMW i Hydrogen NEXT from 2022;" Bavarian Economic Affairs Minister Hubert Aiwanger and BMW    Group Board of Management Member Dr Andreas Wendt impressed by    Landshut Lightweight Construction and Technology Centre’s expertise    in manufacturing components for hydrogen propulsion Innovative capabilities and industrialisation expertise    showcased in small series of BMW i Hydrogen NEXT from 2022Landshut. Development of CO2-free drive  technologies is a top priority for the BMW Group. Hydrogen vehicles  can also play an important role in the growth of e-mobility and will  become an additional option in the long term. Just like electric  vehicles, hydrogen vehicles come with an electric drive train.  However, they do not obtain the energy they need from high-voltage  batteries, but produce it directly on board the vehicle from hydrogen.  In this way, the use of innovative hydrogen technology can help  further decarbonisation.The Lightweight Construction and Technology Centre (LuTZ) in Landshut  plays a key part in this by producing essential components for the  hydrogen-electric drive train that will be installed in the BMW i  Hydrogen NEXT from 2022 and supplying them for installation of the  fuel cell system in Munich. Bavarian Minister of Economic Affairs  Hubert Aiwanger and BMW Group Board of Management Member Dr Andreas  Wendt were able to see the company’s strong innovation capabilities  and industrialisation expertise in the field of hydrogen for  themselves at today’s “Hydrogen Technology Day”.“I am convinced hydrogen technology will gain traction – and I am  committed to making Bavaria a high-tech location for hydrogen  technology. This is a constructive way of responding to the climate  debate,” stated Hubert Aiwanger, Deputy Minister-President of Bavaria  and the state’s Minister for Economic Affairs, Regional Development  and Energy, on a visit to the component plant in Landshut in Lower  Bavaria. “The focus now is on building a hydrogen infrastructure at  national and international level, from production to application.”“Here at our Lightweight Construction and Technology Centre, we are  creating important innovations for the mobility of the future,” said  Dr Andreas Wendt, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG  responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network. “We are developing  highly complex components tailored to the demands of our cars. In this  way, the location is making a vital contribution to the company’s  transformation towards e-mobility. More than ever, our in-house  component production in Landshut serves as an innovation driver.”Small series of second-generation BMW i Hydrogen NEXT from    late 2022Hydrogen vehicles generate the electrical energy needed from hydrogen  directly in the vehicle and offer a number of advantages. They are  best suited for customers who frequently drive long distances, require  a great deal of flexibility or do not have regular access to electric  charging infrastructure. Refuelling takes just a few minutes, as it  does with conventional fuels. Vehicles that run on hydrogen produced  using renewable energy can make an important contribution to meeting  climate goals.The BMW Group will pilot a small series of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT  from 2022, based on the current BMW X5 and equipped with a hydrogen  fuel cell e-drive that only emits water vapour. The BMW Group is  building on its experience with fifth-generation e-drives to develop  this vehicle.However, the conditions needed to be able to offer BMW Group  customers a hydrogen vehicle are not yet in place. Further commitment  is necessary – particularly with regard to the hydrogen filling  infrastructure and requirements throughout the entire energy system,  where green hydrogen must be available in sufficient quantities and  produced at competitive prices for individual mobility.In Germany, the European Union and other major regions of the world,  lawmakers have recognised the significance of green hydrogen for the  energy system of the future. The European Union has mad hydrogen  technology a focal point with the “Green Deal”. The BMW Group welcomes  these activities. Major Asian markets, such as Japan, Korea and China,  have expressed a strong interest in establishing infrastructure for  hydrogen vehicles. The conditions for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will  develop differently around the world.Highly innovative components from Landshut for fuel cell    system Preparations are already underway in Landshut for the fuel cell  system that will be used in the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT from 2022. The  production location in Lower Bavaria will manufacture highly  innovative components for the small series: the so-called stack  housing made of light metal, which holds the fuel cells, and the media  end plate made of plastic and light metal castings, which creates an  air and watertight seal around the stack housing. “Media” refers here  to the hydrogen, oxygen and coolant that are channelled into the  housing through the media end plate to initiate the chemical reaction  in the fuel cells. These complex components are specifically designed  to withstand prolonged contact with hydrogen.""Having the Lightweight Construction and Technology Centre here  at the site gives us a real advantage over our competitors. We have  innovative capabilities and industrialisation expertise";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
“Disability is all relative”: Impressive documentary about Alessandro Zanardi’s “Road to Daytona”.;BMW brand ambassador Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) has now started the process of rehabilitation after his serious handbike accident in June 2020. Thanks to his fighting spirit and his impressive personality, Zanardi has become an idol for many. Some insights into this personality are also provided by a 50-minute documentary that was filmed over several months in 2018 and 2019 as Zanardi prepared for the Rolex 24 at Daytona (USA) in the BMW M8 GTE.;Munich. BMW brand ambassador Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) has now    started the process of rehabilitation after his serious handbike    accident in June 2020. He has been constantly in the thoughts of the    BMW family since that accident and countless fans around the world    have been sending him their best wishes. Thanks to his fighting    spirit and his impressive personality, Zanardi has become an idol    for many. Some insights into this personality are also provided by a    50-minute documentary that was filmed over several months in 2018    and 2019 as Zanardi prepared for the Rolex 24 at Daytona (USA) in    the BMW M8 GTE: “Alex Zanardi – Disability is all relative”. This    documentary will be broadcast on Sunday (2nd May) on the    German TV channel Sky Sport F1. Zanardi has now begun a programme of rehabilitation after his  accident and is in very good hands. It is a very lengthy healing  process, in which there are rays of hope, but unfortunately there are  also repeated complications. His family have granted their permission  for the documentary to be shown. Zanardi himself viewed it before his  accident and was thrilled with the emotional and impressive way in  which his “Road to Daytona” is represented in this film. The title of the documentary reflects Zanardi’s attitude to life:  “Disability is all relative”. In his opening quote, he says: “We all  have to deal with restrictions in a certain way. It is all relative.  Life is a journey and we have to accept our limits. No person can fly  like a bird, so you try to deal with the problem if you cannot  overcome it.” Viewers then get to see exclusive insights into the  collaboration between Zanardi and BMW Motorsport, including some  unique scenes from the races at Misano (ITA) and Daytona that will  send shivers down the spine.  Zanardi’s appearance in the BMW M8 GTE for the BMW Team RLL at the  “24 Hours of Daytona” in January 2019 was one of countless highlights  in a long history of collaboration between Zanardi and BMW Motorsport  that stretches back to 2003 and which has witnessed him repeatedly  dealing with restrictions. The Daytona project kicked off in the  spring of 2018. This time, the greatest challenge was adjusting the  BMW M8 GTE to meet Zanardi’s requirements as he needed to be able to  compete in an endurance race without his prostheses: Zanardi  accelerated, braked, steered and changed gear using just his hands.  The Rückenwind Film crew accompanied him all the way through the  process – from initial preparations in Munich (GER) to the finish of  the 24-hour race. They were with Zanardi on his “Road to Daytona” for  eight months. The 50-minute documentary “Alex Zanardi – Disability is all relative”  will be broadcast this Sunday, 2nd May, at 19:30 CEST on  German Sky Sport F1. The documentary is also available on Amazon (in  Germany, UK and USA). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Confident appearance in the ‘Green Hell’: BMW M4 GT3 completes successful test on the Nürburgring Nordschleife.;BMW M Motorsport has now taken the next important step in the development of the new BMW M4 GT3. The new flagship in the portfolio of cars from BMW M Motorsport successfully completed a series of test drives on the Nürburgring Nordschleife (GER) on Thursday. The two BMW works drivers Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Jens Klingmann (GER) shared driving duties.;Nürburg. BMW M Motorsport has now taken the next important    step in the development of the new BMW M4 GT3. The new flagship in    the portfolio of cars from BMW M Motorsport successfully completed a    series of test drives on the Nürburgring Nordschleife (GER) on    Thursday. The two BMW works drivers Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Jens    Klingmann (GER) shared driving duties. The special characteristics of the over 20 kilometres of the  Nürburgring Nordschleife make it the perfect testing ground for the  development of new race cars. It is a very long track with plenty of  options, and its combination of high speeds, fast corners and  significant climbs and descents provide everything that BMW M  Motorsport engineers require for comprehensive vehicle testing. A race  car that emerges from testing on the Nordschleife is well prepared to  take on all other racetracks. Thursday's testing focused on gaining initial experience on the most  challenging racetrack in the world, especially with regard to the  durability of components under extreme levels of stress imposed by the  Nordschleife and driving behaviour in those very specific series of  corners. First impressions were very positive for the drivers. “The debut of the BMW M4 GT3 on the Nordschleife went very well,”  said Klingmann. “My initial feedback is that the BMW M4 GT3 has  retained the strengths of its predecessor on the Nordschleife, while  eradicating its weaknesses. Of course, it’s not possible to transfer  that 1:1 to other circuits from such a special track, but as a driver  you feel right at home from the word go in the BMW M4 GT3. It is not  unpredictable, but it’s fast nonetheless. It was really great fun.” Farfus said: “It is a great honour for me to be involved so  intensively in the development of the BMW M4 GT3, and to have been  there for the first laps on the legendary Nordschleife. Many thanks to  BMW M Motorsport! It is always special to hit the track for the first  time in a new car, as you never know what to expect and how the car  will behave. The BMW M4 GT3 made a good impression. The driving  experience is very good and we had no technical problems whatsoever on  this challenging circuit.” Further testing has been scheduled and the BMW M4 GT3 will return to  the Nürburgring Nordschleife at the start of June. Ahead of the  24-hour race, the new BMW M Motorsport flagship will be introduced to  the public for the first time. Over the course of the year, the BMW M4  GT3 will also have the opportunity to make its first test appearances  under race conditions in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The BMW Group is launching  production of battery components at its plants in Leipzig and  Regensburg and expanding its e-drive production network. It has been  less than a year since the decision was made to expand production  capacity for e-drives in Germany. BMW Group Plant Leipzig will launch  series production of battery modules on Monday, 3 May 2021, while BMW  Group Plant Regensburg began coating battery cells for high-voltage  batteries in April 2021. High-voltage batteries will also be produced  in Regensburg from 2022. “We expect at least 50 percent of the  vehicles we deliver to our customers worldwide to be fully electric by  2030,” said Michael Nikolaides, Senior Vice President Production  Engines and E-Drives. “And we are systematically expanding our  production network for electric drive trains in response to this.”The company is investing more than 250 million euros in its  Regensburg and Leipzig locations alone to supply the BMW Group’s  growing number of electrified vehicles with high-voltage batteries.  High-voltage battery components will be used in production of the BMW  iX* and BMW i4, both of which will be released onto the market  shortly. The production systems are highly flexible and will also  supply battery components for other BMW Group electrified vehicles in  the future.“We are increasing capacity at existing locations and developing  capabilities at others. In this way, we can make the most of our  associates’ expertise and experience and offer them long-term, secure  jobs,” Nikolaides added. The BMW Group is investing a total of around  790 million euros in expanding production capacity for drivetrain  components for electrified vehicles at its Dingolfing, Leipzig,  Regensburg and Steyr locations between 2020 and 2022.Production of battery modules at BMW Group Plant LeipzigLeipzig is the BMW Group’s pioneer plant for electromobility and has  been building the BMW Group’s first fully-electric vehicle, the BMW  i3*, since 2013. Now, the location will also produce electric  drivetrain components.“We are continuing on this track with the launch of battery module  production and further enhancing the plant’s future viability for  electromobility,” confirmed Hans-Peter Kemser, Plant Director of BMW  Group Plant Leipzig. “Plant Leipzig will play an important role in  supplying the growing number of BMW Group electrified vehicles with  battery components.” The successor to the MINI Countryman, scheduled  to come off the production line in Leipzig from 2023, will be released  onto the market with an electric drive train. “The expertise and  experience gained by staff at our location over the years can be put  to good use. Construction of the battery module lines will make a  major contribution to long-term job security,” emphasised Kemser.From May 2021, the 10,000 sq. m. production area previously reserved  for the BMW i8 will be used for manufacturing battery modules.  Production will get underway with 80 employees working in battery  module production;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BMW SIM News, April 2021.;In our monthly BMW SIM News, we briefly summarise news from the world of virtual racing, and provide information on driver backgrounds, teams, technology, and much more. ;BMW SIM Racing has an extensive and diverse programme in store for  the Esports community in 2021 – from BMW SIM Cups and BMW SIM Racing  teams to technical innovations. In our monthly BMW SIM News, we  briefly summarise news from the world of virtual racing, and provide  information on driver backgrounds, teams, technology, and much more.  Over the year, we also regularly focus on individual subjects in  separate press releases. Kevin Siggy at the wheel of a real Formula E car. A dream came true for BMW Team Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) last  weekend. Ahead of the Valencia E-Prix in the ABB FIA Formula E World  Championship, he was able to claim his prize for topping the overall  standings in the 2020 ‘ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge’, the  chance to drive a real Formula E car. Siggy completed his laps in the  Gen2 car at the ‘Circuit Ricardo Tormo’ and had a first taste of the  forces at work in the cockpit. “The car was really cool and it was  fantastic to be able to drive on the real racetrack in it,” said Siggy  afterwards. “I hadn’t expected it to feel so lively through the fast  turns. I had oversteer a few times and the front wheels locked up a  few times when braking. The Formula E car is tricky to drive. That’s  why it's absolutely understandable that we went out behind the safety  car. In particular, I was impressed by the torque and the power that  is applied through the turns and under braking. You just don’t feel  that in the simulator. Overall, I tried to squeeze every last drop of  enjoyment out of this drive.” Siggy spent the entire race weekend in the paddock, visiting the pit  area for BMW i Andretti Motorsport, where team principal Roger  Griffiths showed him the BMW iFE.21 and explained how everything works  in the team. Siggy also met BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver  Maximilian Günther (GER), who he had coached last year for his sim  racing appearances in the ‘Race at Home Challenge’. IMSA iRacing Pro Series.Two out of three races in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series took place in  April. BMW works drivers celebrated some fine results. This applied  first and foremost to Philipp Eng (AUT), who drive the virtual BMW M8  GTE to victory in the season-opener at Sebring and in the second race  at Laguna Seca. After these two wins from two races, he heads the  overall standings before the third and final race on 6th May, at Road  Atlanta. “I am delighted to be back racing in the IMSA iRacing Pro  Series,” said Eng. “I think it is always great for there to be a  virtual race series taking place in parallel to the one in the real  world. The calendar is short and sweet, with three races. I have  prepared extremely well for all three races and, just like last year,  I am taking it very seriously. We are lucky that we have a very strong  team in the background to take care of setup and strategy. Now I am  really excited about the finale. The competition is really strong, so  winning the championship would mean even more to me.” Behind Eng,  Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Connor De Phillippi (USA) secured one-two  results for BMW in Sebring and Laguna Seca respectively. Augusto  Farfus (BRA), John Edwards (USA) and Turner Motorsport driver Robby  Foley (USA) are also competing for BMW. iRacing 24h Nürburgring.The BMW SIM Racing Teams celebrated a top-three lock-out in the  virtual BMW M4 GT3 at one of the highlights of the season on the  iRacing simulation platform, the Special 24h Nürburgring powered by  VCO. After 153 laps on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife, Maximilian  Benecke (GER), Chris Lulham (GBR) and Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen  (NED) claimed victory for the BMW Team Redline. “Pole position,  fastest lap and then the race win - that was a mega race for us and  there were only a few heart-stopping situations. The car did really  well and it felt like we could go to the limit on every lap,” was how  Benecke summed it up. Team BMW Bank crossed the line in second place,  followed by the BMW Team GB in third position. G2 Esports.The BMW Team G2 Esports has enjoyed an eventful month with numerous  races on the Assetto Corsa Competizione platform. Without a doubt, the  greatest success was Nils Naujoks’ title win in the British GT Esports  Championship with the virtual BMW M4 GT4 in the GT4 class. Naujoks had  already won the race at the start of April on the Brands Hatch  circuit, where his team-mate Gregor Schill finished in third place.  After finishing fourth in the penultimate race, Naujoks recorded a  dominant victory from pole position in the season finale to claim the  class win and the title. G2 Esports was also very active at the wheel of the virtual BMW M6  GT3 in April. The high point was marked by victory for Naujoks and  Arthur Kammerer in the third round of the SimGrid Sprint Cup at the  Imola circuit. The G2 Esports team crossed the line in 16th place at  the season-opener in the prestigious ‘The SimGrid x VCO World Cup’,  the 12h Bathurst. Interview with Nils Naujoks.  Congratulations on winning the title in the British GT Esports    Championship! What did you think about the season and the    championship format?Nils Naujoks: “Many thanks! The races with multiple classes were  certainly something new for us. For virtually my entire sim racing  career, I have been involved in one-make cups or have just raced  within one class. And if I had been involved in a race with multiple  classes, I was normally in one of the faster cars. So, I had to get  used to looking in the mirror a lot more and learn how to let the  faster GT3 cars go past without losing any time myself. In addition,  the real racing drivers also had to adjust to the sim racing  environment and they had to get used to the level as well. That  improved from race to race, so that there were no more major incidents  towards the end of the season.” How important is collaboration like that with BMW SIM Racing    for you as a team, and for the Assetto Corsa Competizione platform?Naujoks: “It helps the whole sim racing scene hugely when a major  player like BMW decides to get involved. It demonstrates recognition  of what we are doing and helps us to make our intensive hobby more  professional, as well as making sim racing more attractive for  partners. Of course, we at G2 Esports benefit from this as we have  more resources to work with than other teams, and it provides  additional motivation.” What highlights do you and the team have to look forward to now?Naujoks: “The British GT Esports Championship was only the beginning  – the season is just getting started. We are focusing on the SimGrid  and SRO series, which have already begun or will be starting soon.  This series contain sprint and endurance formats, meaning that the  weeks and months ahead will be anything but boring for us. The results  in the British GT Esports Championship mean that I have received a  wildcard for the SRO championship, which is a huge help in terms of  time management. I won’t have to complete hot laps each week to  qualify. We only have to wait a few weeks for the next highlight, the  24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps in the ‘Sim Grid x VCO World Cup’, where  we are hoping to score plenty of points in the BMW M6 GT3.” BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup.Jiri Toman (CZE) and defending champion Erhan Jajovski (MKD) are the  latest pair of sim racers to secure their tickets for this year’s BMW  SIM M2 CS Racing Cup finale on the rFactor 2 platform. Toman was  declared the winner after a dramatic finish to the third race of the  season in the virtual one-make trophy at Silverstone. Second place  went to Marcell Csincsik (HUN), who had already claimed his ticket for  the finale with victories in the first two races. Risto Kappet (EST)  finished in third place. Jajovski secured his first win of the season  in the fourth race of the season, which took place on the Nürburgring  Grand Prix circuit. Jajovski had dominated the series last year before  winning the season finale at the BMW SIM Live 2020 event. Johannes  Drayss (GER) and Joonas Raivio (FIN) followed him to complete the  podium. Csincsik, Toman and Jajovski will be joined at the finale by  Michal Smidl (CZE), who secured his place by finishing second in the  second race of the season. The two final races in the BMW SIM M2 CS  Racing Cup take place on 3rd May (Sebring) and on 17th May (Indianapolis).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Performance runs in the family: The MINI John Cooper Works models.;With up to 225 kW/306 hp, chassis technology refined with racing know-how, model-specific design features and sports car flair in the interior, the British brand's top athletes set benchmarks for extreme driving pleasure in both the premium small car and premium compact segments.;Munich. When characteristic driving pleasure rises to  a thrilling race feeling, the John Cooper Works logo immediately comes  into focus alongside the unmistakable design features of the British  premium brand MINI. Each John Cooper Works model combines individual  style with challenging performance in its own unique way. The current  starting line-up of top athletes includes models from the small car  and premium compact segments. Each of them guarantees extreme driving  pleasure and fascinating charisma through drive and chassis technology  derived directly from motorsport as well as specific design features  in the exterior and interior.The connection between MINI and John Cooper Works is based on a  decades-long tradition, joint successes in racing and a shared  awareness of driving pleasure, individuality and premium quality. Six  decades ago, the sports car designer John Cooper paved the way for the  classic Mini on the race tracks and rally tracks. Three overall  victories at the Monte Carlo Rally helped the British small car to  legendary status as early as the 1960s. In the more recent past, the  sporting career was marked above all by the six overall successes for  MINI in the Dakar Rally.With the current John Cooper Works models, the passion for top  performance can also be experienced in everyday traffic. Their  technology, developed with racing know-how, and their  performance-oriented appearance secure them an exceptional position in  their respective competitive environment. As an original in the  premium segment of small cars, the MINI John Cooper Works (fuel  consumption combined: 7.1 - 6.8 l/100 km according to WLTP, 7.1 - 6.9  l/100 km according to NEDC; CO2 emissions combined: 180 - 168 g/km  according to WLTP, 161 - 151 g/km according to NEDC) combines its  extremely sporty character with the individual body concept of a  modern Shooting Brake. Four side doors, the two split doors at the  rear and the dynamically stretched roofline help it to achieve modern  functionality and a lifestyle-oriented appearance. As the largest and  most versatile member of the Performance family, the MINI John Cooper  Works Countryman (fuel consumption combined: 8.2 - 7.6 l/100 km  according to WLTP, 7.0 - 6.6 l/100 km according to NEDC;" CO2 emissions  combined: 188 - 173 g/km according to WLTP, 161 - 152 g/km according  to NEDC) is characterised by its robust appearance and particularly  generous interior space.The most important thing they have in common is an irresistible  forward thrust that comes from the power of a 2.0-litre four-cylinder  engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology. The drive unit develops a  maximum output of 225 kW/306 hp and a maximum torque of 450 Nm. It is  combined with an 8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission as standard. In  both models, the ALL4 all-wheel drive system takes on the task of  distributing the ample drive torque between the front and rear wheels  precisely and as required in every driving situation. The system is  supported by the mechanical differential lock integrated into the  automatic transmission. It acts as a transverse lock to reduce the  speed compensation between the front wheels. With a locking effect of  up to 39 percent, it promotes traction on unpaved terrain or in  adverse weather conditions as well as driving dynamics during sporty cornering.A Brembo sports brake system with four-piston fixed calliper disc  brakes on the front axle ensures superior deceleration performance  even for the top athletes in the compact segment. Another component of  the standard equipment are the 18-inch John Cooper Works light-alloy  wheels. Adaptive Suspension is also available as an optional extra for  the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman and the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman.In all John Cooper Works models, a cockpit characterised by sporty  flair supports the performance experience. The redesigned Nappa sports  leather steering wheel with multifunction buttons on high-gloss black  surfaces and John Cooper Works logo can be heated as an option. John  Cooper Works sports seats with integrated headrests, a stainless steel  pedal set, an anthracite-coloured roof liner and a specific gearshift  or gear selector lever also come as standard. The standard equipment  in the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman and the MINI John Cooper Works  Countryman also includes the multifunctional instrument display, which  is available as an option in the other two top sports cars. In all  models, a new operating system offers optimised options for quick and  intuitive control of vehicle functions, audio programme,  communication, navigation and apps. Live widgets on the 8.8-inch touch  display of the central instrument now serve to activate the desired  menu item, which can be selected with a swiping motion similar to that  on a smartphone.Two colour worlds are now available for the graphic display on the  central instrument and the multifunctional instrument display on the  steering column. The """"Lounge"""" and """"Sport"""" modes  offer relaxing blue and turquoise tones and an animating combination  of red and anthracite, respectively, which can also be linked to the  corresponding settings of the standard MINI Driving Modes for a  comfortable or sporty vehicle setup if desired.Newly compiled trims and equipment packages allow the configuration  of all John Cooper Works models to be easily and specifically tailored  to personal requirements. The John Cooper Works Trim is available as  an alternative to the standard equipment. This option includes  particularly attractive exterior paint finishes such as Chili Red,  Rebel Green, Rooftop Grey metallic or Island Blue metallic. It also  includes John Cooper Works light-alloy wheels in size 18 inches for  the models in the small car segment and 19 inches for the compact top  sports cars, as well as exterior and interior surfaces in Piano Black  high gloss and Dinamica/leather upholstery in Carbon Black.The comfort, connectivity and driver assistance equipment packages  offered for all John Cooper Works models have also been carefully put  together. New to the range for all top sports cars is the Lane  Departure Warning system included in the Driving Assistant. In  addition, Active Cruise Control now also includes a Stop & Go  function for the MINI John Cooper Works and the MINI John Cooper Works  Convertible. It can be used in conjunction with the 8-speed Steptronic  Sport transmission and enhances comfort in those situations where a  slow flow of traffic temporarily slows down extreme driving pleasure. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product  Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com Fuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption were    measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC)    2007/715 as amended.
