With the new BMW 7 Series, the world’s most successful manufacturer of premium vehicles is creating forward-looking ways to enjoy driving pleasure, unsurpassed long-distance comfort and a top-end digital experience. Central to this reinterpretation is the BMW i7. The all-electric luxury sedan is a fully integrated member of the model family and clearly demonstrates how an exclusive driving experience and the ultimate feeling of on-board wellbeing can be combined with an unwavering commitment to sustainability.The generation change at the pinnacle of BMW’s model range is wrapped up in a new definition of luxury that focuses on the individual and their personal attitudes, needs and emotions. In addition to presence, elegance and exclusive premium quality, there is a progressive approach characterised by innovations that directly enhance the user experience, wide-ranging connectivity and standard-setting sustainability of the car. In this way, the new BMW 7 Series has been designed to meet the needs of a modern target group that sees itself as committed to meeting challenges in a responsible manner – and one that views personal mobility as a way to experience unique moments in everyday life and on trips away.A symbol of innovative strength and a milestone in the current model offensive.The new BMW 7 Series incorporates a modern style that focuses on the essentials in its exterior and interior design. The front-end design for BMW vehicles in the luxury segment is dominated by features that are typical of the brand, but a clear distinction is maintained between these models and the others in the BMW range. Innovative features such as the BMW Theatre Screen, the multi-sensory vehicle experience BMW iDrive with the latest generation of BMW Operating System 8, plus the BMW Curved Display and the Manoeuvre Assistant for automated parking and manoeuvring, highlight the progressive character of the luxury sedan.

Unlike its predecessors, the new BMW 7 Series will be available worldwide exclusively as a long-wheelbase model that maximises space in the rear. Different facets of its character are defined by the use of specific design features and drive system variants. The new BMW 7 Series range also includes models from the BMW i and BMW M brands, which allow its myriad characteristics – from elegant, modern and sustainable to expressive, sporty and dynamic – to be brought prominently to the fore.The new BMW 7 Series now offers a choice of combustion engines, plug-in hybrid systems and all-electric drive for the first time ever. The degree of diversity in the drive system portfolio is based on a newly developed flexible vehicle architecture and is an expression of a global model strategy for the new edition of the BMW 7 Series. This enables the BMW Group to take into consideration a customer’s individual needs, infrastructure factors and legal regulations in all relevant automotive markets around the world. The market launch in Europe will initially feature only the BMW i7. In the USA, China and other selected sales regions, two models will be offered at market launch in addition to the all-electric variant, each equipped with a petrol engine and 48V mild hybrid technology.Plug-in hybrid variants of the new BMW 7 Series are expected to follow in numerous markets from the beginning of 2023. These will include the first BMW M model with a six-cylinder in-line petrol engine and plug-in hybrid drive system. A model variant with a diesel engine and 48V mild hybrid technology will be added to the range in Europe just after the market launch. Further variants of the all-electric BMW i7, including the future top-of-the-line BMW i7 M70 xDrive, will be made available at a later stage.As was the case with all its predecessors, the new BMW 7 Series will be built at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing.

{"prompt":"After a ten-year break, a MINI John Cooper Works will once again compete in the legendary 24-hour race at the Nürburgring in 2022. The race car entered by the private team Bulldog Racing and built up in Nürburg will compete in the SP3T class. ->","completion":" Nürburg\/Munich. The 24-hour race at the Nürburgring is considered to be the ultimate endurance test for man and machine. The 50th edition of the high-speed showdown will take place this year from 26 to 29 May on the 25.378 kilometre circuit consisting of the Grand Prix circuit and the legendary Nordschleife of the Nürburgring with a MINI John Cooper Works competing.In September last year, the project was launched at Bulldog Racing in the Eifel region, just a few metres away from the Nordschleife. The base vehicle is a MINI John Cooper Works with the 4-cylinder turbo engine known from the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman and MINI John Cooper Works Countryman with 225 kW\/306 hp and a maximum torque of 450 Nm. The 8-speed Steptronic gearbox taken from large-series-production featuring an integrated, mechanical differential lock with a locking effect of up to 70% ensures that the drive torque is converted into thrilling performance without any losses.Racing modificationsFor racing purposes, the following modifications were made to the standard MINI John Cooper Works which go beyond SP3T class regulations: MINI in motorsportPat Moss made motorsport history in 1962, scoring the first international rally victory for MINI at the Tulip Rally. Her victory marked the beginning of the Classic Mini's unique success story in rally sport, with 3 overall Monte Carlo Rally wins in 1964 (Paddy Hopkirk), 1965 (Timo Mäkinen) and 1967 (Rauno Aaltonen).This string of successes included six overall Dakar Rally victories in 2012 (Leonid Novitskiy), 2013 (Stéphane Peterhansel), 2014 (Nani Roma), 2015 (Nasser Al-Attiyah), 2020 (Carlos Sainz Sr.) and 2021 (Stéphane Peterhansel).The MINI John Cooper Works racing car \"Made in Nürburg\" pays homage to the racing tradition of the MINI brand in the classic colour scheme of the 1960s racing cars in red \/ white. High-speed scheduleOnly seven months passed between the start of the project and the roll-out at the end of March 2022. In the coming weeks and until the start of the 24h race, further tests are scheduled on the Nordschleife of the Nürburgring and at the BMW Group testing centre in Miramas in southern France. Located between Marseille and Avignon, the former race track offers the best conditions for extensive testing and optimisation under a wide range of conditions. The chassis of the MINI John Cooper Works racing car is subjected to an extensive and varied test programme there. Friedhelm Thelen, Nürburgring expert and team boss of Bulldog Racing, knows how important comprehensive testing is before a race: \"The 24-hour race at the Nürburgring puts all components of the vehicle under extreme stress. That's why we're delighted to be able to use the BMW Group Test Centre to put the John Cooper Works through its paces there.\"The BMW Group has been testing new models and innovative chassis technology at the Miramas test grounds since 1986. The driver line-up and the further race programme for 2022 will be announced at a later date. \n"}

The 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA), the season-opener in the FIM Endurance World Championship 2022, began according to plan for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. Starting from fourth place, Jérémy Guarnoni (FRA), Markus Reiterberger (GER) and Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) were battling in the leading pack during the early hours of the race, putting themselves in a good position for another podium finish in the FIM EWC. However, a stone lodged in the radiator was the cause of an unfortunate retirement after four and a half hours. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team had already shown in practice and qualifying sessions that it remains one of the best teams in the FIM EWC this season. The pace with the race set-up was particularly promising and the team was brimming with optimism at the start of the 24-hour race on Saturday afternoon. Starting rider Guarnoni, Reiterberger and Mikhalchik kept the #37 BMW M 1000 RR consistently in the top four. The plan was to work their way gradually up through the field as the race progressed. However, Guarnoni was forced to make an unexpected pit stop after four and a half hours. A stone had pierced the radiator and the subsequent overheating damaged the engine so severely that it was impossible to continue the race. The team and riders are now fully focused on the second stop for the FIM EWC 2022, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) on the first weekend in June. Reactions to the 24h Le Mans. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Of course, that early retirement was hard for us to swallow. Another top result would have been more than deserved for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. This confirmed that the hard work that we put in with the team over the winter had paid off. The overall package was fast, the racing pace was spot on and the fuel consumption, which is an important factor in endurance racing, was very efficient. The riders also gave a superb performance and the team worked superbly in the pits. It is extremely bad luck for a stone to hit the radiator and cause a chain reaction that ended the race for the #37. However, that can happen. Now we have to build on the many positive aspects and on what we learned from Le Mans. Preparations are underway for the next race. Spa will be a home race for the team and we would all like to convert the good performance into the result it deserves.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The race was good – until we had a big stone in our radiator. The water was straight out, the oil temperature went up and the engine broke. It was very disappointing for everybody that the race ended that way. For the riders, for the team, the mechanics, they all had worked so hard this winter to prepare the bike. We were very well prepared but this was something that nobody could foresee. We have a big protector in front of our radiator but this stone was at least two centimetres big and when it hits the radiator at 260 km\/h then nothing helps. This happens, we are very disappointed but we will come back!” Markus Reiterberger: “We started pretty well into the race and were able to constantly be within the top-four. We expected to benefit from our efficient fuel consumption after nine or ten hours and that our pace would improve even more during the cooler night stints but unfortunately we did not get that far. It of course is a bitter pill to swallow that a stone in the radiator ended our race early but no one could foresee this, this was just bad luck. It is a pity and we just take two points from qualifying away. But we don’t give up, we still have two 24-hour races and at least one eight-hour race this season. I feel sorry for the entire team who had worked so hard over winter to give us the best possible package. It really would have deserved to get a top result.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “Overall, the race week was quite positive for us because we showed our speed over the entire week and the bike was particularly good for the race. For the first four and a half hours, we were fighting for the podium positions with a really good feeling. Unfortunately, we had bad luck and a stone decided to stop our race. But I already said last year after the Bol d’Or: we lose together and we win together. And afterwards, we have won at Most. So I am confident that more success is coming in the future. I am looking forward to getting back on this bike and fight again for top positions at my team’s home race at Spa.” Jérémy Guarnoni: “We could not do anything; it was completely bad luck. But it can happen, that’s endurance. I think that we did a good job, all three riders and the team. The bike was pretty good and we were waiting for the night to make a step forward. This unfortunately did not happen. Now we will focus on Spa, and I think at Spa, we have all chances to get to the podium. Thanks to the team and to my team-mates – see you at Spa!”\n"}

For the remaining concerts of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2022, the Double Cone of BMW Welt will host two further internationally known ensembles. On April 19, the Marco Mezquida Trio from Spain will interpret this year’s theme “Key Position”, followed by the British Ashley Henry Quartet on April 26. It is then up to the expert jury of the BMW Welt Jazz Award to choose two finalists from a total of six participants competing in the final concert in the auditorium of the BMW Welt on July 9, 2022. In addition, the winner of the audience award will be announced.For the fifth concert on April 19, the Marco Mezquida Trio will perform in the BMW Welt. Pianist Marco Mezquida is one of the most versatile and most productive representatives of the Spanish jazz world. Known from a very young age as a “prodigy”, “workaholic at the piano” and “once-in-a-century musician” in his native country, this Menorca-born artist has, at the tender age of 34, recorded over 30 albums to date. He performs solo improvisation and delivers programs with duos, trios or orchestras. With his inspiration coming from sources as far-ranging as Ravel, Skrjabin, Bach and traditional American jazz, Mezquida’s work is best described as a pioneering, modern interpretation of Spanish folklore. This can also be seen in his work with Flamenco guitarist Chicuelo, a project that was very successful both in Germany and on the international stage, or his most recent work “Talismán”, which he recorded with cellist Martín Meléndez and drummer and percussionist Aleix Tobias.At the last concert prior to the finale, the Ashley Henry Quartet can be heard in the Double Cone of the BMW Welt on April 26. 30-year-old London-based pianist Ashley Henry completed his studies at the Royal Academy of Music as recently as 2016. Widely known as a prodigy, Henry was offered the opportunity to perform alongside legends such as Terence Blanchard and Jean Toussaint that very same year and was invited as the youngest participant to date to play with Robert Glasper at the International Piano Trio Festival. His appointment as guest resident Musical Director at London jazz clubs “Jazz Café” and “Ronnie Scotts” and nominations for the Jazz FM Awards in two categories in addition to being named “Breakthrough Act of the Year” by Fader Magazine secured his big break in 2017. Adding to this, Ashley Henry’s acclaimed debut album “Beautiful Vinyl Hunter” further cemented his status as a multifaceted artist in 2019.Evening concerts of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2022March 8, 2022 Julia Hülsmann TrioMarch 22, 2022 Jacob Karlzon TrioApril 5, 2022 Anat Fort TrioApril 12, 2022 Giovanni Guidi QuintetApril 19, 2022 Marco Mezquida Trio April 26, 2022 Ashley Henry QuartetThe concerts in the Double Cone of BMW Welt are offered free of charge; however, seating is limited and cannot be guaranteed.

And now the unique character profile of the brand’s largest Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) has been honed to significant effect thanks to extensive design refinements – most notably a visually impactful front end – plus a new-look M Sport package, light-alloy wheels measuring up to 23 inches (an ex-factory first for BMW) and the latest-generation iDrive control\/operation system including BMW Curved Display and BMW Operating System 8. The new BMW X7 also comes with a further expanded range of standard equipment, additional driver assistance systems and the latest 48V mild hybrid technology for the three engine variants offered.The new BMW X7 is a central pillar in the ongoing product offensive at the most exclusive reaches of the premium carmaker’s model line-up. The new X7 will be produced at BMW Group Plant Spartanburg, the competence centre for BMW X models in the US state of South Carolina. The worldwide market launch for the new BMW X7 will get underway in August 2022.Exterior design: exclusive looks, progressive style.Fuelled by its highly versatile skillset, the largest BMW X model convinces with both on-the-road elegance and off-road ability. Extensive design modifications accentuate above all the visual exclusivity of the largest BMW X model even more vividly. Indeed, its design underscores more clearly than ever the status of the new BMW X7 as one of the brand’s flagship models. The newly structured front end picks up on signature BMW design cues such as the twin headlights and BMW kidney grille. In their newly interpreted form, these features emphasise the car’s upright stance and reinforce its road presence.Split headlight units are making their debut in the new BMW X7. The horizontal LED light elements set higher up in the front end house the position light, daytime driving lights and turn signal indicators. The LED units located below them for the low-beam and high-beam headlights give the impression of retreating into the background with their dark housing and deeply embedded position in the front apron, and only come to the fore when activated. The new adaptive matrix LED headlights with non-dazzling high beam and adaptive light distribution now also provide the functionality of front fog lights with their automatic bad weather light.Discreet cascade lighting for the two BMW kidney grille elements brings a richly extravagant feeling to the front end of the new BMW X7, both when stationary and on the move. The “Iconic Glow” BMW kidney grille is a standard feature of the range-topping BMW X7 M60i xDrive This high-quality, vegan surface material with leather-like properties has exclusive three-dimensional quilting and surface perforation.Together, the newly designed instrument panel – with its slim air vents and an ambient light bar included as standard in its lower section – and the BMW Curved Display bring a modern style shaped by progressive digitalisation to the cockpit. The innovative light bar complements the likewise standard ambient light. Its effective backlighting – with the help of LED units and a graphic including “X7” lettering (or the M logo in the new BMW X7 M60i xDrive) – is an integral element of the situation-based light effects and enhances the aura of exclusivity inside the cabin. The gear selector lever is also given a new and cutting-edge design.The further expanded range of standard equipment for the new BMW X7 goes to new lengths in enhancing the comfort of those on board and maximising their wellbeing. As well as the four-zone automatic climate control, panoramic glass sunroof and hi-fi system, it now also includes the comfort seats for the driver and front passenger, a Sport leather steering wheel with gearshift paddles and a new tray for wirelessly charging compatible mobile phones. Highlights of the options list include the Sky Lounge panoramic glass sunroof (illuminated by LED units), the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System and the newly designed Travel & Comfort System. Active seat ventilation and a massage function are also offered for the driver and front passenger. If the new Comfort Package is specified, the seats in the second and third rows can also be heated, as can the steering wheel and the armrests for the driver and front passenger.Newly developed engines with the latest 48V mild hybrid technology.The engine range is headed by a new 4.4-litre petrol V8 for the range-topping BMW X7 M60i xDrive, which is derived from the engines powering the high-performance cars coming out of BMW M GmbH. M TwinPower Turbo technology and a cross-bank exhaust manifold imbue the 390 kW\/530 hp unit with peak torque of 750 Nm radio technology. And the new BMW X7 also allows customers to enjoy the benefits of optimised smartphone integration, a personalised BMW ID and an eSIM designed for the new 5G mobile technology.\n"}

The team, which finished second overall last year, is well prepared heading to the season-opener on the banks of the Sarthe. The winter tests with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR were successful. The four riders – Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), Markus Reiterberger (GER), Jérémy Guarnoni (FRA) and Kenny Foray (FRA) – were able to evaluate and confirm multiple modifications to the bike. They include updates to the engine, electronics, cooling, brakes and suspension. The final winter test took place at Le Mans at the end of March, and served as a dress rehearsal for the season-opener at the same venue. The starting positions for the race will be determined in a two-part qualifying on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning. The 45th staging of the 24 Hours of Le Mans will start at 15:00 CEST. The factory team, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, will be joined on the grid by three private teams: Team LRP Poland, Tecmas Mersen GMC, and Seigneur Motorsport Team Mont-Blanc. Quotes ahead of the 24h Le Mans. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The action is coming thick and fast for us at the moment. Just one week after the opening round of the FIM Superbike World Championship at Aragón, we now kick off the 2022 endurance season with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. The 24 Hours of Le Mans is a real classic, and we go into the race with plenty of confidence. After the successful end to the 2021 season, we spent the winter working intensively to make our BMW M 1000 RR for the FIM EWC even better. The tests confirmed that we are well prepared. The team and riders know the challenges posed by the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and are ready for them. The goal is to lay the foundation for a successful 2022 FIM EWC season with a top result at the season-opener.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I think that we are very well prepared. We have worked together with BMW over the entire winter to give the riders the best bike. In general, I am very positive. The riders are perfect; the crew is strong. Let’s hope we also have some luck. Our aim is a very good result in the race.” Markus Reiterberger: “Given the positive tests and winter preparations, I am very optimistic about the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It will be a tough, long and tiring race, but we are perfectly prepared. The bike is better than ever. The final sessions before the race are just about fine-tuning the rideability for us riders. Our clear goal is to challenge for victory. We are ready for any conditions and will give it everything we have.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “First of all, it will be great that the spectators will be back at Le Mans; it will be a fantastic atmosphere there. That gives you an extra boost, especially during the cold night stints. We will start the weekend by working on a good setting for the race, show our speed during practice and qualifying, and then prepare ourselves for the very long race. We are highly motivated and want to start the season on a high.” Jérémy Guarnoni: “I think we all expect to win Le Mans. We have a good package with the bike, the riders and the team. I think we are among the favourites as the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team won the last race at Most and they have been on the podium at Le Mans but a 24-hour race is really long and you never know what can happen. If we riders don’t make mistakes, the bike is good and strong, and we can finish the race, I think we have a big chance to win.” Kenny Foray: “I am really happy to be at Le Mans and it will be the first Le Mans race for three years with spectators, so I think everybody is very excited about that. It is a really important race for everybody, and I hope that the team can get a very strong result there.” Note to editors:We will provide you with current information and statements on qualifying as well as ongoing updates during the race via our new Twitter channel:https:\/\/twitter.com\/BMWMotorradMoSp A race summary follows on Sunday in the form of a classic press release. \n"}

The 2022 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) kicked off at MotorLand Aragón. BMW Motorrad Motorsport experienced an opening weekend of highs and lows in Spain. Competing for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team were newcomer Scott Redding (GER) and Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR), who was standing in for the injured Michael van der Mark (NED). Loris Baz (FRA) and Eugene Laverty (IRL) were contesting their first race weekend together with the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team. Mikhalchik, a BMW works rider in the FIM Endurance World Championship, caught the eye with an impressive Saturday on his WorldSBK debut with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. He was the best-placed BMW rider in both Superpole qualifying and race one, finishing eighth on both occasions. However, he crashed in Sunday morning’s Superpole Race and had to settle for 15th place in race two. Redding struggled all weekend. His best result was 12th place in the Superpole Race, before retiring with a technical issue in race two on Sunday afternoon. The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team came into the season-opener with its sights set on the top ten – and successfully achieved that goal. Laverty finished tenth in race one on Saturday, just ahead of his team-mate Baz. The Frenchman then went one better in race two on Sunday afternoon: seventh place was the best WorldSBK result for the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team. Laverty came home 12th this time. Baz had also set the fastest time in the third free practice session on Saturday morning. Round two of the 2022 WorldSBK season will take place from 22nd to 24th April in Assen, Netherlands. Quotes after the season opener at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “After testing, which was in different conditions and painted a far more positive picture, the opening weekend was generally disappointing for us. However, there were various individual highlights. They include the strong performance from Ilya Mikhalchik on Saturday, and seventh place for Loris Baz and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in race two this afternoon. They are the positives that we will take with us. On the other hand, we still have a lot of work ahead of us – particularly with Scott, but also with Eugene. We must now work hard to understand the causes, and come up with a plan for solving the problem and making sure we are back at the front of the field. We hope to do better in Assen.” Loris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 10 \/ R01: 11 \/ SP Race: 13 \/ R02: 7): “I thought that P7 was our potential. To be honest, I was disappointed with yesterday and this morning, especially after the testing we did on Monday and Tuesday and FP3. So we needed to understand why we were slower in the race than in testing. Why I was slower in the group than alone. So our crew made some changes before race two. I was feeling more comfortable on the bike, I understood more things, I had the bike more in my hand. I know that our potential at the moment is to be behind the three top manufacturers and that is what I wanted to do. I tried to not any mistakes and bring it home. I said from the beginning, that this weekend is the base for our work for this year. And it is exactly what happened. We will build the whole project further from here, and work hard as we did from the first test on. For sure it is not my ultimate goal to be seventh, but the season is long and I am happy that I did a good race and with the work that BMW and the entire team do. So a big thank you to them. Now off to the next one.” Ilya Mikhalchik, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 8 \/ R01: 8 \/ SP Race: DNF \/ R02: 15): “For sure, I take more positive than negative points from my first WorldSBK weekend. The main thing was that I replaced Michael and we showed strong results in Superpole and race one. That was especially good as we did not have so much testing before. Today was not our day. I would have liked to continue in the same way we did yesterday. But in the Superpole Race, I was not able to push from the beginning. Then I made a small mistake and crashed. Thanks to the team that built a completely new bike within two hours and we made it to the grid for race two. The feeling of the bike was actually not bad, but the track temperatures were too high and it was difficult for me to find in a rhythm. After a few laps I started to feel better. My pace was good enough for seventh or eighth, but it was too late. I was riding alone, catching the top-ten group. For sure, those results did not make me happy after the strong Saturday. But that’s racing and every race can be different. Now we have a lot of information for BMW to continue to improve the bike to get it into top positions in the races.” Eugene Laverty, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team (SP: 14 \/ R01: 10 \/ SP Race: 11 \/ R02: 12): “In the Superpole Race, the bike felt really good. I really wanted to be in the top-9 to change my grid position for race two, but I just did not have the pace to beat those guys. But anyway, the performance was good. In race two this afternoon, the temperature was higher and I was in difficulties with the front tyre. That did not allow me to catch the group for seventh position. My pace was more or less the same than theirs but it was not meant to be today, I had lost too many positions in the early laps and was not able to recover. It was great for the team that Loris was seventh. The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team can be really proud of the effort they all put in not just this weekend, but also in winter testing.” Scott Redding, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team (SP: 16 \/ R01: 15 \/ SP Race: 12 \/ R02: DNF): “This weekend was not what I expected it to go like, even considering we had two days of testing on Monday and Tuesday. Then we come to the race weekend and we lost lap time. So for me it was hard to accept this. We worked very hard to try and solve our problem, but we really never got anything to help us through the weekend. It was hard. We need to understand why it was different, we need to understand why we are suffering more than with last year’s bike. There have been some changes on the engine and the bike so we need to understand why this happening because the potential is more. Then in the last race of the weekend, I just had no grip, the brakes where not working so well and the engine overheated. That is just how it goes. There is not much more to say. We need to work, understand and try to come back stronger because we don’t deserve to be in this position.” \n"}

BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers, Shaun Muir, Team Principal of BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Michael Galinski, Team Principal of Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, and the four works riders Redding, Laverty, Baz and Mikhalchik will be on hand for informal chats. The highlight of the evening is a cinematic surprise in which the BMW Motorrad works riders demonstrate their theatrical talent. The media presentation at BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Hospitality in the paddock gets underway at 6.00 p.m. CEST on Thursday 7th April. Quotes ahead of the season opener at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “After a winter break of four months it is always exciting to start the new season. Lots is new for us. For one thing, we have developed the BMW M 1000 RR in many areas. We have also strengthened ourselves in terms of riders and are now competing with a quartet that combines speed with a wealth of WorldSBK experience. Scott Redding is new to BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, and we are confident that it won’t take him long to get used to the BMW M 1000 RR. Unfortunately, Michael van der Mark’s fractured leg means that he is unable to be there for the opener. We wish him a speedy recovery and hope to have him back at the track soon. Ilya Mikhalchik is a good replacement who will help us gain further valuable insights into the motorbike in the first few races. At Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, Eugene Laverty brings his combined experience, and alongside Loris Baz forms a strong rider pairing that will allow the team to take a big step forward in the WorldSBK. We are setting ourselves realistic goals for the Aragón opener. We are aiming to be up there in the top five initially, and then be battling for the lead as soon as possible.” Scott Redding, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Because of the cold track conditions it was hard to do the work really consistently, but we were working on a few things. One of them was rear grip; we are still struggling in that area at the moment. In the end it was another circuit we have come to, it was a bit different, so we had to play a lot with the bike set-up to get more of a feeling but we are still not achieving the feeling that we want to have so we still have some more work to do. Now I am looking forward to the first race on the BMW. It’s going to be hard, for sure, but this is where we can collect more race data for me to ride with the other guys and understand the riding style a little bit more. The expectation? We need to see. At the moment we are not quite where we want to be but we have a couple of days to come with some more solutions and then we’ll try again and see if we can improve.” Ilya Mikhalchik, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “On these two days of testing we tried a lot of new things for the upcoming season. We found a lot of positive things, so I think that Scott and Michael can make another step during the season on the bike so we are happy with that. Then in the end I focused on my settings for the race weekend to be well prepared. For sure, I am really excited to compete in my first WorldSBK races and first of all I want to say a big thank you to BMW for this opportunity. Secondly I wish Michael that he gets well soon and back on his bike as fast as possible. For now I do his job and so far it is looking quite well for me. I get a better feeling for the bike with every lap. I am really confident for the race week because I know the track, I know the bike and the team now, so we can do a good job in my first WorldSBK races.” Eugene Laverty, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “We still have some work to do. The good thing here is that we have the race weekend at the same track so we can continue and try to improve in our weak areas but the two days of testing have been beneficial, even if I still want more. I like the Aragón track and in the past have often been strong here. It’s the first race weekend with the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team and so far it has been a fantastic atmosphere in testing so I am excited to start the season. The weather will be much warmer at the weekend compared with this test so that changes everything. So let’s see, it will be good fun.” Loris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “It has been a strange test because it was really cold but the Pirelli tyre works well in the cold, like always. Overall I am happy with the improvement we made, even if I am not completely satisfied with the bike yet. The most important thing is that we are going into the right direction, we make the right changes and I think that everything we tried was pretty good. I am happy with the job we do with BMW and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team. It’s great that we could continue the good work we made at Misano after the difficult Barcelona test. Now I am excited to go into the first race weekend. I’m a race guy and all I want is to be on the grid so it is really great to start again. The first weekend is always interesting because you build from there so it is an important weekend as a base for the rest of the season. I hope we can continue with the same feeling we had at the test, trying to make improvement again on the race pace. Let’s see what we can achieve.

We almost went through our full test programme. We did one very fast lap time but as always we mainly focused on long distance tests and we found everything we were looking for. We just had some minor technical issues that we could solve for the race weekend. We still have some small things to do in the free practice just before the race but in general I am happy with everything, including our new rider and new team members. The bikes were really well prepared by the technical crew – better than ever! Together with our tyre partner Dunlop and BMW power we are very happy and I think we are very well prepared for the race.” Jérémy Guarnoni: “It has been really two good days of testing because we got some dry action but also rode in the wet. So we could try the bike in absolutely all conditions and that is really important in view of a 24-hour race. The bike was good in the wet and we have a great pace also in the dry. We still have some work to do, especially to prepare for the fast lap time in qualifying where we still have a lot of potential. Overall, I am happy with this test and I think the package riders, team and motorcycle can fight for the win. We just need to work a little bit more during race week and try to do our best.” Markus Reiterberger: “It was great to be back at the race track with the entire team after the winter. It also was nice to ride the bike with what I think is the most stunning design we have ever had. Is has been two productive days. As expected, the weather was changeable but we were able to ride more in the dry than we thought. We started our test program yesterday in the dry, tested many parts and got mileage on them. We did a lot of set-up work overnight and were able to confirm that with a good feeling this morning in mixed conditions. We were always at the front on rain tyres, intermediates and slicks. But we didn’t go chasing times and then it started raining hard at the end. But we were at the forefront there, too. We have great pace and a good base to fight for victory here at Le Mans. We only have a few small things to work on, but we’ll use the time until the race. We definitely have a lot of potential and I’m looking forward to a great time in a few weeks.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “It was a good test. Regarding the weather, we had all conditions, with wet, intermediate and dry so we could test things under all conditions. I felt quite good on the bike and we also made some steps from last year, especially in race trim so we are well prepared. Maybe we were not the fastest at this test but this is not the main thing at the moment. Now I am looking forward to return to Le Mans for the race weekend in a few weeks. We keep working and try to do our best.” Kenny Foray: “The test was a good preparation for the 24-hour race and the season. There have been many further developments on the bike and it was good that we were able to try them in all conditions. It has been busy two days and we learnt and confirmed a lot.

He worked through several test items for us and got used to the Superbike. He completed many kilometres and we made good progress with him. In the end, he was the second-fastest BMW rider in the dry. Michael’s surgery was successful but we don’t know yet when he can ride again. In case he can’t, Ilya would be a potential substitute for the season opener. On Scott’s side, the test went partly positively, partly we have still some work to do. We confirmed the engine with all riders as a positive step. We also were strong in regards to top speed but we clearly lose in sectors two and four, especially when accelerating out of the fast corners. Here we definitely still have to work on our package, in combination with set-up and traction control. We were able to go through a lot of test items also with the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team. Loris unfortunately had a crash that cost him a lot of time. In addition, we had some minor technical issues here and there, but that’s the purpose of the tests, to identify them at an early stage. Those were topics we can well react on. In general, we are happy but we still have to work on the pace to close up to the top.” Scott Redding, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was good to have two days of testing here in Barcelona. We have made some improvements with the bike and the electronics which is important for me and the team. Then we had to try a few test items, tried the different tyres to get a feeling, tried again the electronics. We worked a lot and we did make some improvements which is good. But the goal post is always moving. You close the gap to the first one and then someone goes faster again. But we have to look at our situation, what we are doing and how we are improving. That’s where we need to focus. Then we had some rain in the afternoon of the second day which was interesting. It was good for me to get on the wet track and just get the feeling. It’s not too different to how it was in the past. I felt quite good. We need to do a bit more with the set-up and stuff but the temperature dropped quite a lot so we decided to test some other parts, practice starts a bit more because I haven’t done many starts on this bike and then we improved which was good. We also tried some other things for the conditions. In general, we did quite a lot but we still have more to do. We are moving on to Aragón, and I think we have some more things that we need to confirm there.” Ilya Mikhalchik, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First of all I want to say a big thank you to BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the team for giving me this opportunity, and secondly a speedy recovery and a get well soon to Michael. I hope he can back on his bike soon. I am happy to be here and for sure, the World Superbike is completely different. You need to know how to work on this bike to go fast. We got this feeling more with every lap we did. Lap by lap I felt where we should go and this brought me more speed and more fun on the bike. Hopefully we can continue in the same way and soon I will get more confidence and will be faster on the bike. Barcelona was a new track for me and it was a kind of a new bike, but I enjoyed it and really felt like home. At the next test at Aragón, we know each other already, I am acquainted to the bike so I think this will be a small advantage for me there and our work will be even better than here.” Eugene Laverty, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “Especially the first day was really good. We continued our progress from Misano day two in the same direction. We improved the braking again and in the afternoon we worked a lot on electronic strategies to help because this asphalt is usually slippery so it was a big chance to work on power reduction and traction control to improve that for the 20-lap races. We made good lap times. Still it’s too far to the top, we need to reduce this, but I am happy with the way the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team is working and it was positive.” Loris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “Yesterday morning, we did a quite a good job. At the beginning, I did not have the feeling I wanted with the bike. We improved this, I was pretty fast, but then I made a small mistake and crashed in an in-lap. That was basically the end of our test because we were not able to re-start after the crash yesterday. This morning we had some issues due to the crash I guess. We did in and out-laps trying to find the problem today. It is frustrating but for sure it is better to happen here than at Aragón. Before the crash we were pretty fast, not as fast as we want for sure, but on a track where the grip is so low, I think that’s our weakest point at the moment and we need to improve in these kinds of conditions. It has not been a productive test like Jerez or Misano but sometimes this happens. I am looking forward to Aragón now.” \n"}

With the Anat Fort Trio and the Giovanni Guidi Quinteton April 5 and 12, two further outstanding jazz ensembles will demonstrate their skills. After a total of six concerts between March and April following the theme “Key Position”, the BMW Welt Jazz Award jury will pick two ensembles to compete in the finale on July 9.The third ensemble onstage at the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2022 will be the Anat Fort Trio on April 5. Pianist Fort ranks among the Israeli artists raised in New York that continue to put their mark on contemporary jazz. Fort has since returned to Israel, a move that in no way slowed down her international career. Since 2007, she has been publishing her albums at the Munich-based label ECM with her most recent album “Birdwatching” featuring Italian clarinetist Gianluigi Trovesi as star guest. As so many of her great jazz pianist colleagues, Fort prefers performing as part of a trio working together with bassist Gary Wand and drummer Roland Schneider. Various experiments including her most recent collaboration with tango guitarist and vocalist Shlomo Ydov notwithstanding, the trio has been her ensemble of choice for over 20 years and a constant throughout her artistic career. The resulting trust allows for unparalleled freedom of improvisation, as seen on their most recent album “Colour”, released by Sunnyside Records, and soon to be heard at BMW Welt.Only one week later, on April 12, the Giovanni Guidi Quintet will show their skills in the Double Cone of the BMW Welt. While still a teenager, pianist Guidi truly impressed trumpeter Enrico Rava, Italian super star of jazz, during Rava’s jazz workshops and has been his permanent accompanist ever since. In that capacity as well as increasingly with his own projects and ensembles, Guidi has since been making his name on the international stage. For his current programme “Avec le temps” he and his fellow trio members, Chicago-born bassist Joe Rehmer and Portuguese drummer João Lobo, were joined by two other prominent names of the Italian jazz world: woodwind player Francesco Bearzatti and guitarist Roberto Cecchetto. The ensemble prefers impressionist, lyrical and bluesy sounds, as seen in their homages to poet, composer and chansonnier Léo Ferré or the recently deceased trumpeter Tomasz Stańko.Evening concerts of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2022March 8, 2022 Julia Hülsmann TrioMarch 22, 2022 Jacob Karlzon TrioApril 5, 2022 Anat Fort TrioApril 12, 2022 Giovanni Guidi QuintetApril 19, 2022 Marco Mezquida Trio April 26, 2022 Ashley Henry QuartetThe concerts in the Double Cone of BMW Welt are offered free of charge; however, seating is limited and cannot be guaranteed.

On its first appearance at the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA), the brand-new BMW M4 GT3 challenged at the very top of both the GTD PRO and the GTD class until the final stages. But it was not meant to be and the podium was narrowly missed in both classes. In GTD PRO, BMW M Team RLL’s #24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, driven by Philipp Eng (AUT), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR), crossed the line in fourth. The same result was scored by Turner Motorsport in the GTD class with the #96 BMW M4 GT3. The Florida endurance classic marked the second round of the 2022 IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Starting from seventh on the grid, the #24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 moved up the field into the podium positions and briefly lead the GTD PRO class by the halfway mark. From then on it was involved in a thrilling battle for the lead and the second six hours turned into a proper sprint race. The car ran like a clockwork, the team acted cleverly on strategy and Eng, Yelloly and Wittmann faultlessly completed their laps. The #24 was lying in second position until one hour before the chequered flag when it suffered a gearbox issue and dropped off the podium positions. The #25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 also raced into top three in the opening stage of the race but suffered a setback after two hours. A power steering issue resulted in a long repair. This dropped the trio of Augusto Farfus (BRA), John Edwards (USA) and Connor De Phillippi (USA) down the field but they continued the race. They brought the #25 home in tenth place. The two BMW M Motorsport teams in the GTD class also both had an eventful 12 hours that did not end with the top results they would have deserved. At Turner Motorsport, Sebring marked the 500th BMW race for Bill Auberlen (USA) and until the eighth hour it looked that the Californian could have lots of reason to celebrate at that milestone. Auberlen, who shared the #96 BMW M4 GT3 with Robby Foley and Michael Dinan (both USA), had taken the GTD lead but then got hit at the rear by another competitor and spun into the grass. This dropped the #96 back to eighth in the class. But the Turner Motorsport drivers fought their way back and with three and a half hours to go, Auberlen brought the car back in the lead. The #96 stayed at the very top before losing ground in the final stages due to a team mistake and crossing the line in fourth. The newest BMW M Motorsport family member, Paul Miller Racing, experienced cruel bad luck in the race after showing convincing performances in all sessions. In the first three hours of racing, the #1 BMW M 4 GT3 was fighting for the very top in GTD class. But then it became victim of an LMP incident. A car trying to avoid a spinning LMP2 car hit the #1 on the left rear damaging the suspension. This was a major setback on Paul Miller Racing’s way to a very strong result in their first race with the BMW M4 GT3. Madison Snow, Bryan Sellers (both USA) and Erik Johansson (SWE) finished 16th in the GTD class. The BMW M Motorsport team’s BMW M4 GT4 cars have been in action already on Thursday in the two-hour IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge race. The #43 Stephen Cameron Racing BMW M4 GT4 crossed the line in fifth position. Sean Quinlan and Gregory Liefooghe (both USA) shared duties in this car. Turner Motorsport finished ninth with the #95 BMW M4 GT4, driven by Auberlen and Dillon Machavern (USA). Their team-mates Foley and Vincent Barletta (USA) retired in the #96 car. Reactions after the Sebring 12 Hours: Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “After twelve exciting hours of racing we leave Sebring with mixed feelings. This race has once again confirmed that endurance racing not only has highlights in store but can also bring setbacks and the final results have been disappointing, of course. Right up into the final phase it looked as if we could finish on the GTD PRO podium with our #24 and BMW M Team RLL. But a race isn’t over until the chequered flag, and unfortunately a gearbox problem set us back a good hour before the end. The podium was clearly in the cards. I’m convinced that the number 25 would have fought for the rostrum as well if it hadn’t been for the early problem with the power steering. It was important that we covered a lot of race kilometres with this car, too, to gather information. In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport also was on course for the podium until the very end but then dropped back. Paul Miller Racing also was among the favourites with the BMW M4 GT3. It’s a shame that the team was denied a well-deserved top result through no fault of their own. Overall, our conclusion is that the pace and performance of all four cars were very good. Now it’s time to analyse and fix the problems that have arisen.” Marco Wittmann (BMW M Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, 4th place GTD PRO): “It’s been a highlight for me to race on this famous track for the first time. It was a mega event and a lot of fun. We were fighting at the top with a competitive car all weekend. In the race, we were able to show our potential and fight for the lead with the Corvette. BMW M Motorsport, BMW M Team RLL and my fellow drivers did a great job and showed a very good performance. Unfortunately, we dropped back one hour before the end due to a technical problem. Although we missed the podium, we can take a lot of positives from this race. I’m sure the first podium will come soon.” John Edwards (BMW M Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, 10th place GTD PRO): “Unfortunately we had a technical issue quite early in the race that cost us a lot of time. After that we took the race as a test session. It was important for Connor and myself to get a couple of hours in the car to learn as much as possible for the rest of the season. We are disappointed with our result but it was good to see that the car was competitive. That gives us confidence for the next race in Long Beach.” Bill Auberlen (Turner Motorsport, #96 BMW M4 GT3, 4th place GTD): “The new BMW M4 GT3 ran perfectly over the twelve hours. We lead a lot of this race – didn’t quite have the pace to win it, but stayed in second. Due to an error with the calculation of my maximum driving time we had to come to the pits. Otherwise we would have lost all our points. This one was much better than Daytona. Let’s take this, take the points and move on to the next one.” Bryan Sellers (Paul Miller Racing, #1 BMW M4 GT3, 16th place GTD): “We had a very good showing which was ended by someone else’s mistake. We started very strong, taking the lead and were pretty much in control of the race with a 30-second gap to the second-placed car. The balance of the BMW M4 GT3 was very good and all drivers did similar lap times. Then we were taken out by another car. But still it was important to get the car fixed and bring it to the finish line. It was our first race with it and there is a lot to learn. So every lap of experience is extremely valuable.” \n"}

In preparation for the 2022 season of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad Motorsport this week completed the first of three back-to-back pre-season tests. In Misano (ITA), the two BMW teams – the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team – both worked through an extensive test programme on Wednesday and Thursday. A further two tests will follow in Barcelona (ESP) on 25th and 26th March, and at MotorLand Aragón (ESP) on 4th and 5th April. Many areas of the BMW M 1000 RR have been optimised and developed over the course of the winter break. As such, Scott Redding (GBR \/ BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team) and the two riders from the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team, Eugene Laverty (IRL) and Loris Baz (FRA), tested many new components and set-up variants. The areas that have been developed by BMW Motorrad Motorsport include the engine, brakes, riding geometry and ergonomics as seats and fuel tank shapes. In addition, individual rideability options for the riders had been generated in the electronics area. The three factory riders provided more input, on the basis of which BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the two teams will now work closely together to prepare for the coming tests. BMW newcomers Redding and Baz also used the test to familiarise themselves further with the BMW M 1000 RR. Overall, the three riders completed over 1,700 kilometres of testing without any issues. Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team was unable to attend the test in Misano, due to an injury. He fractured his leg in a crash whilst training on his mountain bike. This injury also means the Dutchman is unable to take part in the tests in Barcelona and at MotorLand Aragón. BMW factory rider Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) will replace him as the reserve rider at these tests. Three-time IDM champion Mikhalchik is part of the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team in the FIM Endurance World Championship and also lines up in the Spanish Superbike Championship this season. Quotes after the Misano test. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “First of all, we wish Michael a good and speedy recovery, of course. His absence shortly before the start of the season is obviously very unfortunate. With him being absent we partly were missing a reference to last year’s topics which made the test work a bit more difficult. However, in Ilya we have a very good replacement, who will stand in for him at the next two tests. With him we can now work through the test list, fine-tune the 2022 package and Michael’s crew can gel. Ilya knows the BMW M 1000 RR well and is thus able to provide valuable input. He is a strong BMW factory rider, and has thus earned the opportunity to test the WorldSBK package. Nevertheless, our two days of testing have been overall very constructive. Our new riders could gather experience with the BMW M 1000 RR and get acquainted with the new developments.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We had only one rider testing with Scott but it has been a real positive test. The feedback we got from all our test items was that we made good steps forward over the winter period. So from Jerez to where we are today has confirmed what we have been doing, mainly chassis, electronics and engine. Especially the engine development has proved to be a good steps for all the guys from BMW. The first day was a lot about evaluation and the second day was a bit more of fine-tuning the set-up and that went pretty well. I am really happy with the fact that we focused mainly on the SC0 tyre for him. He has not got that set-up yet for him where he could use the extra grip of the SCX or the SCQ. So all work was with the SC0 and it was a good, solid test with a lot of positives to take away.” Scott Redding, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “So we finished the two days test here in Misano. I’m really happy with the work that we have done. We changed a lot at the bike angles. We had some new parts to test. That changed a lot on the bike. So we focused mainly on getting a feeling for me with this bike. It was very positive, and I enjoyed the two days here. We made some good steps, and we managed to close the gap to the front guys. That was important to me. I can go home from this test very happy. So we are going in the right direction, and I’m looking forward to Barcelona.” Michael Galinski, Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “As a team we are really satisfied with this test on both sides of the garage, as both riders made a step forward. Overall, they have been on the same level. The new parts, especially the new engines we got from BMW, are top and a significant improvement. We made some steps forward also with the other items we could test. We are still lacking nine tenths of a second to the very top but we got closer und were able to continuously improve. The team grew together very well. Both sides are on the same level now, and it was the second time for us to work in the final team constellation. Now I am already looking forward to the Barcelona test. This will be another challenge as it is known that there is a bit less grip. Nevertheless we are looking forward to it and to the next step we can make there.” Eugene Laverty, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “Today was really good. I made some progress because yesterday I still didn’t feel quite comfortable on the bike. Today especially in braking improved a lot. The bike is now transferring correctly. I’m a smaller rider than the other guys. So we needed to make some changes. Now I feel much more comfortable and make some really consistent lap time. So I’m really happy with the step.” Loris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I am really happy. I did not know what to expect. In Jerez, everything was totally new for me coming from a completely different bike. After then, we had a long break, so I was really happy to get back on the BMW M 1000 RR. This track is completely different, also the grip level is completely different but I was pretty happy straight away with the new engine spec and the electronic development that the guys have done. So, yes, I am really happy with the direction they took, I think it is the right one. I am happy with the pace and over the two days I managed to do a lot of consistent laps on the race tyre. I’m really happy with the job done, we are also close to Scott and Eugene so it’s a good direction for BMW.” \n"}

{"prompt":"In 1962, the British brand achieved its first international rally victory, thanks to the talent and passion of a modern-day heroine of racing: Pat Moss. The new MINI Pat Moss Edition for the MINI 3-door and        MINI 5-door is a tribute to a pioneer, MINI's sporting history and true team spirit. And strong women play a key role in shaping the success of the MINI brand today as well - these are their stories.  ->","completion":" Munich. On International Women's Day 2022, MINI remembers a legendary female racing driver. Pat Moss made motorsport history in 1962, scoring the first international rally victory for the British brand on the prestigious Noordwijk - Monte Carlo - Noordwijk route, better known as the \"International Tulip Rally\". Her victory not only kicked off the Classic MINI's unique success story in rallying, but also caused a sensation in male-dominated racing. \"Mossie\" and \"Wizz\", as Pat Moss and her co-pilot Ann Wisdom were called in the racing scene, managed to create facts that nobody could ignore. At a time when gender roles were predetermined, these two women unceremoniously defined them themselves. 60 years later, society has taken some decisive steps forward. And more than ever, strong women at MINI are shaping the success and image of the British premium brand.Stefanie Wurst has been in charge of the MINI brand since February 2022. With her experience in holistic business management and her intercultural background, she is determined to electrify the British premium brand and strengthen the issue of sustainability. \"It is the very idea of MINI to make economical use of resources and available space. The small ecological footprint is already in MINI's genes, so to speak. When it comes to sustainability, our customers need to know what we are doing and why, so that they can make a conscious decision,\" says Stefanie Wurst about her approach. For her, sustainable corporate governance also includes values such as diversity, tolerance and openness. \"It's not about favouring certain groups, it's about building a modern team that reflects and understands the changing global communities well. A modern brand must be meaningful, positive and constantly evolving.\" Jennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod is accompanying this realignment as Head of Communications for MINI and BMW Motorrad. For her, diversity and equal opportunities are part of MINI's recipe for success: \"We clearly see diversity as a strength - both within and outside our organisation - the appropriate makeup of our teams in all areas is a key factor in the creativity, innovation and ultimately success of the MINI brand.\"With her talent, courage and passion, Pat Moss in the Classic MINI left the male competition behind her - and many an established role model along as well. Now a special edition bears the name of the rally driver who died in 2008. The Pat Moss Edition for the MINI Cooper S 3-door and the MINI John Cooper Works and the MINI Cooper S 5-door will arrive at dealers in May 2022 - exactly 60 years after its triumph in the Netherlands. Its design reflects both the brand's racing tradition and the personal history of Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom, and also integrates MINI product innovations such as the Multitone Roof. \"When there is already a strong story, as with the Pat Moss Edition, it is a pleasure to define the details, combine the elements that underline this story, choose the right colour combination and decide where to place the design features,\" says Morgane Bavagnoli, the MINI designer responsible. Her own story at MINI began in 2010 with an internship in Munich, which she was thrilled with right from the start and which was to shape her career. Almost 10 years later and after working at Designworks and BMW, Morgane Bavagnoli returned to the MINI design team. Among other things, she was responsible for the colour concept of the MINI Electric Pacesetter. Most recently, for example, she also developed the design of the décor and interior surfaces for the MINI Countryman in the \"Untamed Edition\". Her heart beats for surprising details that even MINI fans may only notice at second glance. For example, the main symbol of the MINI Pat Moss Edition - the graphic of a tulip, which can be seen discreetly but unmistakably in many places. It is these special details with which designers like Morgane emphasise the individual character of a MINI and contribute to the success of the brand. \"Being a designer at MINI is something special. The opportunity to get involved in completely different projects and work at different levels - from pre-development and research to concept cars and series implementation - is always refreshing,\" says Morgane Bavagnoli about her personal drive.Telling stories like Pat Moss's is also Lina Fischer's passion. In the MINI Editorial Office, she works on editorial marketing and the MINI Insider magazine. She has been part of MINI since 2010. The editorial production around the Pat Moss Edition focused on female empowerment in several respects. A female photographer, an editor and two female drivers for the action scenes on the road worked together for the shoot and staged the edition, which was largely designed by women. \"I am proud to have worked on this project together in a team with such strong and inspiring women,\" says Lina Fischer.Verena Markart, Product Manager at MINI, also appreciates this kind of inspiration in her work. For her, the MINI community in particular is always a key driver in her work. \"Unconventional, versatile, creative and self-determined personalities, for whom community and new experiences are important, motivate me every day\" For her, the rally victory commemorated by the Pat Moss Edition is linked to the attitude that still applies to MINI today: “Born to compete”. The motto rounds off the Quick Facts about the legendary Tulip Rally, which are listed below the side scuttles on the front side walls: from the route Noordwijk - Monte Carlo - Noordwijk, to the distance of 2,500 kilometres and the vehicle, the Mini Cooper, to its starting number 104.\"MINI stands for thinking things differently, and that's what I love about our brand,\" says Yvonne Schrader, who heads up brand management, communications management and artwork at MINI. \"I associate Pat Moss' success above all with the motto \"Only MINI can do\", turning dreams into action. Mossie\" and \"Wizz\" already had this mindset. They dared to do the extraordinary instead of just talking about it.\"With British understatement, co-driver Ann Wisdom later recalled the success in the Classic MINI: \"We didn't see ourselves as pioneers back then, we simply drove a rally.\" The MINI team firmly believes that diversity is a strength. A team of players with different backgrounds and personalities is crucial - friction is where new ideas, solutions, products and services for the MINI brand are continuously created. \n"}

{"prompt":"60 years ago, a female British racing driver gave the brand its first victory in an international rally. With charismatic edition models, MINI commemorates the start of the British small car’s extraordinary racing career and a courageous foray into a male domain. Premiere on International Women’s Day, market launch in May 2022.  ->","completion":" Munich. Racing is in the MINI genes: the greatest feats in the brand’s history were achieved on the rally track. And the foundation for all this was laid by an exceptional female driver. In May 1962, the classic Mini was added to the list of winners of an international rally event for the first time. In the international Tulip Rally – from the Dutch municipality of Noordwijk to the French Riviera and back again – Pat Moss achieved the best time over the distance in the classic Mini Cooper. 60 years later, MINI celebrates the talent, courage and passion of this British woman racing driver with a fascinating special edition. The Pat Moss Edition of the MINI 3-door and MINI 5-door, limited to just over 800 vehicles, not only commemorates the launch of the classic Mini’s extraordinary sporting career, it also marks a pioneering achievement for female power in motorsports. Success in the Netherlands turned the classic Mini, Pat Moss and her co-driver Ann Wisdom into enduring heroines in a discipline otherwise dominated by significantly larger vehicles and entirely the preserve of men.Unconventional design features and stylish details characterise the Pat Moss Edition, which will be available from May 2022 for the MINI Cooper S 3-door and, the MINI Cooper S 5-door and the MINI John Cooper Works . With 4-cylinder turbo engines offering an output of 131 kW\/178 hp or 170 kW\/231 hp (MINI John Cooper Works), these cars bring the thrills of sporty driving fun to everyday traffic. The exclusive design of the edition models cites the racing history of the British premium brand as well as the sporting careers of Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom.It also incorporates MINI product innovations such as the Multitone Roof. What is more, an additional variant of the Multitone Roof is available for the first time in the Pat Moss Edition. The colour gradient of the vehicle roof extends from Chilli Red to Melting Silver and Jet Black. With the innovative paint finishing process fully integrated in production at the MINI plant in Oxford, this will be the first time a second colour variant has been realised. It will be available for customers to order from March 2022. Minimal deviations in the colour pattern caused by changing environmental conditions ensure that every MINI with a Multitone Roof has the character of a unique specimen ex works. On the new edition models, the charismatic roof paintwork is combined with the body finishes Pepper White or Midnight Black metallic and also red exterior mirror caps.A stylised tulip symbolises the first rally victory: it appears on the C pillars and side scuttles of the edition vehicles along with the inscription “Pat Moss”. The wheel hub covers also feature an exclusive design with a graphic which is based on the outline of the typical Dutch flower and the MINI wordmark.The key facts of the 1962 Tulip Rally appear below the side scuttles on the front side panels: the route Noordwijk – Monte Carlo – Noordwijk, the distance of 2 500 kilometres, the vehicle, namely a Mini Cooper, and its starting number 104. These are supplemented with the slogan that still applies to MINI to this day: “born to compete”. The tulip motif, the name inscription and the key facts about the first every rally win are also to be found on the screen-printed aluminium door sill trims designed exclusively for the edition model.Another design element used for the first time in the Pat Moss Edition is the horizontally aligned bonnet stripe in white. The printed combination of three-dimensional numbers and letters – 737 ABL – is the registration number of the classic Mini that won the 1962 Tulip Rally, likewise recalling the historical model. Meanwhile the original signature that Pat Moss wrote on the bonnet of her car after one of her victories adorns the front apron of the edition model as a graphic imprint.In the interior of the edition vehicles, the iconic signature on the Piano Black interior surface in the passenger area is another tribute to the revolutionary woman rally driver, who passed away in 2008. The sports leather steering wheel bears the edition emblem in the form of a tulip graphic which appears on the clip of the lower spoke. The abstract depiction of engine pistons moving up and down serves as the motif for a graphic on the interior surface on the driver’s side. With bars of different heights forming the shape of the letters “M” and “W” – standing for “Moss” and “Wisdom” – they symbolise that perfectly coordinated duo that caused a sensation in the rally scene for so many years.The MINI Pat Moss Edition is a tribute to a female racing pioneer, MINI’s rally history and true team spirit. One of the remarkable details of the first rally triumph for the classic Mini is the fact that Ann Wisdom insisted on taking part in the Tulip Rally despite being pregnant at the time: she went on to provide her team mate Pat Moss with unerring navigation guidance over the 2 500 kilometre route.Mossie and Wizz – as they were known in the paddock – formed a successful duo for seven years. The two women had the courage to compete in a male-dominated sport – and they brought about fundamental changes, too. The younger sister of Formula 1 driver Stirling Moss, Pat Moss also won the Sestriere Rally in Italy in 1968, achieved a podium finish in numerous other international competitions and was crowned European Ladies’ Rally Champion five times. Ann Wisdom is considered the first professional woman co-driver in the history of rallying. As successful sportswomen in their own right, the two viewed their courageous foray into a male-dominated domain with typical British understatement. “We didn’t see ourselves as pioneers back then,” said Ann Wisdom years later. “We were just entering a rally.”Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom paved the way for an extraordinary career for the classic Mini. In 1964, 1965 and 1967, the British small car secured outright victory in the Monte Carlo Rally. Decades later, MINI became the dominant brand in the world’s toughest endurance rally, achieving overall victory in the Dakar Rally four times in a row from 2012 to 2015. Two more overall victories followed in 2020 and 2021. \n"}

{"prompt":"Faster, more precise, more efficient: The first fully electric BMW xDrive system in the BMW iX and the BMW i4 M50. Two engines, four driven wheels and a globally unique drive torque control system ensure optimal traction, driving stability and dynamics in every situation.  ->","completion":" Faster, more precise, more efficient: The first fully electric BMW xDrive system in the BMW iX and the BMW i4 M50.Two engines, four driven wheels and a globally unique drive torque control system ensure optimal traction, driving stability and dynamics in every situation.Munich. More than 35 years ago, all-wheel drive provided a new form of driving pleasure for the first time in a BMW, and the intelligent distribution of power between the front and rear axles has been known as BMW xDrive for almost two decades. The fascination of four driven wheels now reaches an additional, particularly sustainable dimension. The first fully electric BMW xDrive system can now be experienced on the road. It makes its debut in the BMW iX and the BMW i4 M50 .Like all BMW iX vehicle types, the fully electric Gran Coupé from BMW M GmbH is powered by an engine on both the front and rear axles. This creates an axle-parallel all-wheel drive without a mechanical connection between the front and rear wheels. The interaction of the two engines is optimised by an innovative and globally unique drive torque control system. The electric BMW xDrive system thus ensures the ideal form of power transmission in every driving situation – combined with a typical BMW driving experience.Intelligent networking of driving stability control, actuator contiguous wheel slip limitation and drive control.The fully electric BMW xDrive system makes it possible to transform outstanding drive power, expressed for example in the BMW i4 M50 with a system output of up to 400 kW\/544 hp and a maximum torque of 795 Nm, into superior driving dynamics. This requires precise distribution of the drive torque. This is ensured by linking the DSC (driving stability control) system with the all-wheel drive-specific version of the actuator contiguous wheel slip limitation and the Combined Charging Unit (CCU), whose highly integrated range of functions for the first time includes both charging and drive electronics.The intelligent networking of all systems makes it possible to distribute the drive torque requested by the driver between the two engines in such a way that traction and driving stability, dynamics and efficiency are guaranteed to an optimum extent in the respective driving situation. DSC defines the general conditions under which the electric BMW xDrive system can operate. It permanently analyses the vehicle's wheel speeds, steering angle, driving speed, longitudinal and lateral acceleration and yaw rate. Based on these parameters, a speed corridor is determined in which the two drive units may be active to ensure a stable driving condition. The My Mode selected by the driver and whether the DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) is activated are also taken into account. This mode is a special DSC mode in which, in interaction with actuator contiguous wheel slip limitation and other control functions, an even sportier driving style is possible on normal surfaces without interventions, among other things through increased intervention thresholds. In addition, a maximum drive is achieved on loose ground such as snow, sand or gravel.From the data supplied by DSC and the drive torque requested by the driver, the CCU calculates the ideal distribution between front and rear-wheel drive. The fully electric xDrive system can react noticeably faster and with significantly higher control quality to any change in driving situation than would be possible with a transfer box between the axles familiar from BMW models with combustion engines.The drive control of the CCU, actuator contiguous wheel slip limitation and the driving stability control system interact flexibly and precisely. If required, the data supplied by DSC about the driving situation can already proactively include an all-wheel drive request. In many driving situations, a change in the distribution of drive torque between the front and rear engines alone can increase driving stability without requiring any further intervention. If one wheel threatens to lose grip with the road surface, actuator contiguous wheel slip limitation with its particularly fast and precise reactions comes into play first. Only in critical situations does DSC also assist with wheel-specific braking interventions.Optimal traction, perfect directional stability, maximum efficiency.During driving off and accelerating, the desired drive torque is distributed between both engines by the CCU to provide optimised traction. In addition to the road friction values and the driver's choice, the electric BMW xDrive and actuator contiguous wheel slip limitation also take into account environmental parameters such as wind, uphill or downhill gradients, the vehicle settings of the My Modes and the DTC, as well as the dynamic axle-load distribution, which provides more weight and better power transmission to the rear axle during acceleration. Due to the direct integration of actuator contiguous wheel slip limitation into the drive torque control system of the CCU, long signal paths to the driving stability control system are eliminated, meaning that interventions can be performed at a speed that is up to 10 times higher and in a particularly precise dosage. This ensures unwavering directional stability of the vehicle even during extremely dynamic acceleration manoeuvres.When the accelerator pedal is pressed moderately, a continuously higher proportion of drive torque is provided by the rear electric drive unit as the speed increases. In phases of constant driving, the drive is finally provided solely by the engine acting on the rear wheels. This creates the traditional BMW driving experience. At the same time, the efficiency of the drive system and, with it, the range of the vehicle is optimised.Full all-wheel drive functionality is available at all times. For example, even when driving in My Mode Efficient, any spontaneous load demand is immediately met with a significant increase in drive torque on the front axle. When cornering dynamically, on the other hand, the proportion of rear-wheel drive is increased. The front wheels can therefore absorb higher cornering forces due to the reduced drive torque. In this way, the vehicle's driving stability and agility are increased in equal measure. Depending on the driving situation, the fully variable electric BMW xDrive system can implement any form of power transmission: traction-optimised all-wheel drive with variable torque distribution as well as pure front or rear-wheel drive.Precisely controlled energy recovery optimises driving stability and efficiency.In coasting and braking phases, both engines can feed energy back into the high-voltage battery by means of a generator function. This makes a significantly higher recuperation performance possible than just one motor. The fully electric BMW xDrive system also makes it possible to control these energy recovery processes in such a way as to ensure maximum driving stability and efficiency at all times. The system is designed so that the more powerful engine on the rear axle also takes on the main role in recovering energy. In curves and in adverse road conditions, on the other hand, a higher proportion of energy recovery performance is provided by the front engine.Just like the drive torque, the energy recovery torque can also be divided quickly and precisely between the two engines. In addition, the intelligently networked drive torque control system ensures that a stable driving condition is also guaranteed during deceleration processes. The slip control set by DSC helps to prevent unstable driving conditions caused by excessive braking recovery. The transition from deceleration through recovery to the intervention of the hydraulic braking system is not perceptible to the driver. The integrated braking system also contributes to this, providing a constant pedal feel at all times. The figures for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, power consumption and range are measured using the methods required according to Regulation (EC) 2007\/715 as amended.

{"prompt":"Optimised noise insulation, aeroacoustics and vibration comfort: in order to ensure the best possible comfort ever realised in a BMW, the new BMW i7 is undergoing a diverse range of tests in the BMW Group’s laboratories and on its test benches. The testing programme is also designed to ensure electromagnetic compatibility. ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW i7 is being developed with the aim of combining hallmark driving pleasure with a level of comfort that is in a class of its own. One key factor here is the acoustic properties. The level of well-being in the interior of the purely electrically powered luxury sedan is largely determined by the degree to which disturbing noises can be kept away from the occupants. There are a variety of potential noise sources to be taken into account here, so near-production prototypes of the BMW i7 – and indeed all other model variants of the future BMW 7 Series – undergo an extensive programme as part of their acoustic testing.At the Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ) in Munich, test and development engineers check the full range of the vehicle’s sound emissions and immissions. Motor and rolling noise are analysed in detail, as are the aeroacoustics and vibration comfort, in order to fully determine the acoustic properties of the new luxury sedans. This also includes precise alignment of acoustic pedestrian protection and the motor sound emitted in the interior of the BMW i7 – the latter having been developed as part of BMW IconicSounds Electric, a collaborative venture between the BMW Group and Hollywood film music composer Hans Zimmer.The driver of the BMW i7 has a choice: characteristic silence or BMW IconicSounds Electric developed in collaboration with Hans Zimmer.The acoustic test benches at the new branch of the BMW Group’s Research and Innovation Centre FIZ North are specially designed to meet the requirements of electromobility and enable all driving situations to be simulated realistically. Here, any irritating noises registered by development engineers during test drives on the road can be recreated and selectively eliminated. Roller dynamometers with a unique quiescent level and interchangeable surface coverings enable the measurement and validation of drive acoustics and tyre noise on all road surfaces that are relevant to day-to-day traffic anywhere in the world.The BMW i7 aspires to redefine the high standards of the luxury segment – and this very much applies to acoustic comfort as well. Great importance was attached to noiseless power delivery of the electric motor. Contributing factors here include acoustic optimisation of the electric drive units, a model-specific mount concept and a newly developed noise encapsulation for the electric motors. Taken together, these measures enable the BMW i7 to achieve effective acoustic decoupling across a wide frequency range, thereby ensuring maximum acoustic comfort in the interior in all driving situations. As a result, the driver of the purely electrically powered luxury sedan always has the choice of enjoying either the characteristic silence of the motor or the emotionally powerful BMW IconicSounds Electric developed in collaboration with Hans Zimmer.Increased body rigidity at the front end and tyres with a foam absorber on the inside for integrated noise insulation likewise help raise the acoustic and vibration comfort of the new luxury sedans to an outstanding level.Acoustic testing on the climatic test bench and in the wind tunnel.In order to be able to test the effectiveness of all measures under extreme climatic conditions too, the development engineers at FIZ North use an acoustic climate test bench specially designed for this purpose. Here, all globally relevant conditions can be simulated and a wide variety of noise sources can be analysed and optimised such as the acoustics of the air conditioning and ventilation system throughout the entire vehicle – in particular at very low or very high temperatures.In the same way as the motor and tyre rolling acoustics, ambient noise can also be selectively reduced. For this purpose, the aeroacoustics of the BMW i7 are perfected in the acoustic wind tunnel. Clear-cut body surfaces, flush-integrated door handles, aerodynamically optimised exterior mirrors and an almost completely closed underbody not only contribute to the low air resistance of the luxury sedan, they also help create its excellent acoustics.Innovative materials for optimised sound insulation.In addition to the noise and vibrations emanating from the vehicle itself, it is primarily the noise sources from the outside that can impair the experience of comfort while driving. The new acoustic simulator at FIZ North enables the noise emitted in day-to-day traffic to be simulated under laboratory conditions – this includes the sounds made at road construction sites and by passing trucks, for example. Numerous loudspeakers are used to project these sounds onto the vehicle prototypes from all directions to test the effectiveness of the interior noise insulation.Highly effective and also weight-optimised sound insulation is enabled by the use of innovative materials developed in conjunction with acoustic lightweight construction. One of the ways in which outstanding shielding of external and intrinsic noise is achieved is by means of sound absorbers incorporated in the pillar trim, seats, roof liner and rear shelf. Together with the comfort glazing, which prevents unwelcome noise from entering through the window panes, this adds the final touch of perfection to the customer experience. There are also fleece elements in the doors and on the sill and wheel arch trim which reduce rolling noise, thereby maximising the experience of comfort.Intense testing of electromagnetic compatibility.With their detailed analyses and precise optimisation, the development and test engineers seek to ensure that the new luxury sedans offer the best comfort experience ever realised in a BMW. This also includes an analysis of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). In the so-called EMC absorber hall at the FIZ, prototypes of the new luxury sedans are exposed to powerful electromagnetic fields so as to test the susceptibility of their electrical systems to interference and see how they interact with the environment.The test engineers are able to analyse the diagnostic results transmitted from the vehicle in real time via fibre optic cables. The test programme in the EMC absorber hall enables comprehensive protection of the entire vehicle, ensuring absolutely reliable functioning of the suspension control and assistance systems and interference-free reception of online data, telephone, radio, TV and navigation signals.\n"}

In an exclusive edition of only 99 automobiles, a strictly limited number of the M850i xDrive Gran Coupé were created by Jeff Koons and BMW during several years of close collaboration. With THE 8 X JEFF KOONS, the most elaborately designed vehicle in all of BMW's history will be presented to a global audience for the first time on the occasion of Frieze Los Angeles. BMW is a long-term partner of the art fair; Jeff Koons is represented globally, and at Frieze Los Angeles, by Pace Gallery.Jeff Koons, artist: “My edition of the BMW 8 Series is my dream car! It is very special to me and I’ve wanted to create a special edition BMW for a long time. It is sporty and flashy as well as minimalist and conceptual. I can’t wait to drive it and ride in it, and I hope that people will enjoy the Gran Coupé just as much as I do. On the car, the lines are getting bigger on their journey from the hood towards the trunk, creating a sense of forward movement just as the ‘POP!’ and the vapor thrust design elements do. The blue color resembles the vastness of space and I like the idea of the car being a global car. What matters is how we relate to each other and our awareness of everything we are surrounded by. For the driver and all passengers, there is a heightened state of pleasure. This is what my car has to offer.”Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG: “BMW thrives on constantly seeking out new challenges! Working with Jeff Koons again has inspired us all – throughout headquarters and across our plants in Germany. Never before in the history of our company has a BMW been created with such an extensive design effort as THE 8 X JEFF KOONS. A 'rolling sculpture' that will not only be displayed as a coveted collector's item in museums but will also be allowed to flourish on the road as a genuine BMW.”Over 200 hours of work time just for the exterior paint jobThe expressive and striking design combines eleven different exterior colors ranging from blue to silver as well as from yellow to black. Only four cars will be painted each week. The multi-colored interior is comprised of high-end materials, fine leather and a cupholder lid with an edition badging and the artist’s signature. The seats are made up of the striking red and blue which reflects the colors of superheroes from the comic book universe as well as those of the company’s high-performance unit BMW M. Overall, the energetic and powerful design includes both elements of pop art as well as geometric patterns paying homage to the sporty 8 Series Gran Coupe’s intricate contours and shape. The exploding lines of color at the rear, in turn, are their own unmediated homage to the artist's 2010 BMW Art Car, while the \"POP!\" on each side as well as the vapor thrust imagery symbolize the power and speed of THE 8 X JEFF KOONS, according to the artist.Over 200 hours of manual work were spent by highly specialized professionals at the BMW Group plants in Dingolfing and Landshut on the exterior paintwork alone, where the color samples were often applied with magnifying glasses. \"Energetic,\" \"tantalizing,\" and \"strong\" is how international media described the car, following the publication of first design studies on the occasion of the cooperation’s announcement in early September 2021 at Munich's Pinakothek der Moderne museum. \"Dozens of engineers and designers have given their all to celebrate our partnership and make his vision come true,\" said Oliver Zipse. The artist himself spent many days on site at the Dingolfing plant over a period of numerous months discussing design options with the BMW employees involved. “I was thinking very intensely about it: What is the essence of the 8 Series Gran Coupé? What is the essence of power? How to create something that exemplifies all the energy of the BMW 8 Series that is also able to touch upon the human element?”Koons signature in the Bavarian blue of the BMW logoEach vehicle comes with a large-format certificate signed by Jeff Koons, which in addition to Oliver Zipse's signature also contains the individual Vehicle Identification Number of the respective vehicle. The artist also designed the dust jacket of the Driver's Manual. One further signature of the artist is let into the cupholder panel. Koons deliberately chose the Bavarian blue from the BMW logo.The original BMW 850i was the first model of the 8 Series launched in 1990 and was celebrated as creating a new perspective of progress in advanced motoring, appealing to the connoisseur who acknowledges elegance and performance as the ultimate blend of perfection. THE 8 X JEFF KOONS also continues this tradition.New York: Christie's auction for a good causeIn 2010, the American artist already created a unique BMW M3 GT2 Art Car which performed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and was unveiled at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. That same year, the rock singer Bono from U2 wrote in an editorial for the New York Times that Jeff Koons should have a part in designing the car of the future. BMW and Koons continued the conversation and in early 2020 decided on a limited edition of the new BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé, which had its world premiere in January 2022.Initially, THE 8 X JEFF KOONS will be on display for the general public in Manhattan's Rockefeller Plaza before one vehicle from the edition, signed on the tailgate by Jeff Koons, will be auctioned off at Christie's in New York on April 4. All proceeds from the highest bid will go to the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC). Jeff Koons has been personally involved with this nonprofit NGO for over two decades.Following its world premiere, THE 8 X JEFF KOONS will be presented at numerous art fairs and events in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, including the 16th Istanbul Contemporary, Paris Photo, the Goodwood Festival of Speed, Art Dubai, West Bund Art & Design Fair Shanghai and Art Basel Hong Kong.History of the BMW Art CarsInitiated by French race car driver and art aficionado Hervé Poulain and conceived in collaboration with the founder of BMW Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch, the first BMW Art Car was commissioned when both asked Alexander Calder to design Poulain’s BMW race car in 1975. Since then, 19 artists from throughout the world have created BMW automobiles of their time. The BMW Art Cars by Roy Lichtenstein, Esther Mahlangu, Jenny Holzer, Andy Warhol, David Hockney, Ólafur Elíasson, Frank Stella, Robert Rauschenberg, Cao Fei and John Baldessari, among others, are all inspired by developments in art, design and technology. Jeff Koons designed the 17th BMW Art Car in 2010, the BMW M3 GT2, which also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. On the occasion of 50 years of BMW Group Cultural Engagement last year, the Art Cars entered the digital realm and are presented in augmented reality since then. Via the free Acute Art app, the digital rolling sculptures are accessible to everyone around the world at any time. BMW M850i xDrive Gran Coupé:: 11.0 – 10.7 l\/100 km according to WLTP,: 251 – 243 g\/km according to WLTP.THE 8 X JEFF KOONS: Price upon request.

The BMW Junior Team enters its third year in 2022, and will be in action on two fronts with the BMW M4 GT3. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) will team up with BMW M Team RMG at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), as they look to challenge for overall victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. More highlights await the trio in the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup. There, the BMW Junior Team and ROWE Racing will contest five endurance races, with the highlight being the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). At the wheel of the second ROWE Racing BMW M4 GT3 will be BMW M works drivers Nick Catsburg (NED), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR). “The term BMW Junior Team has become a legendary one, even outside of BMW M Motorsport. I am very pleased that we have been able to add new chapters to this legend since 2020,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH and one of the mentors of the current BMW Junior Team. “Dan Harper, Max Hesse and Neil Verhagen have performed impressively for the past two years and lived up to name ‘BMW Junior Team’. I am certain that they will cause quite a stir again this season at the wheel of the BMW M4 GT3. I find it particularly fascinating how the current success sees the project come full circle since the founding of the first BMW Junior Team in 1977, thanks to Jochen Neerpasch’s initiative. Even after so many decades, Mr Neerpasch remains a great asset and inspiration for BMW M Motorsport.” Neerpasch says: “The BMW Junior Team has successfully completed its apprenticeship on the Nordschleife for the past two years. The three lads are now preparing intensively for their biggest test at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. We have high expectations of them. As far as the drivers themselves are concerned, I see the BMW Junior Team on the podium. They will also be put to the test in the GT World Challenge Europe. They will be driving at racetracks that are new to them, and will be up against the best GT drivers in the world – at ROWE Racing, they will be in direct comparison with established BMW M works drivers. It is going to be an eventful season, but I am sure that they will succeed again in the new environment.” Harper, Hesse and Verhagen are currently with Formula Medicine in Viareggio (ITA), where they are preparing physically and mentally for the season ahead. They are living together in one house there, as they will do at the Nürburgring again after the GT World Challenge Europe test at the start of March. This is to ensure they are as close as possible to the racetrack and BMW M Team RMG ahead of the start of the season. The first race in the BMW M4 GT3 will be the opening round of the Nürburgring Endurance Series on 26th March – followed by the first race in the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup at Imola (ITA) on 3rd April. The focus will then switch fully to the Nordschleife until the 24-hour race on 28th\/29th May. The GT World Challenge season continues at the start of June at Le Castellet (FRA). This is followed by the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps and the final two races at Hockenheim (GER) and Barcelona (ESP). Base camp for the BMW Junior Team for the second half of the season will be Viareggio. The team responsible for the BMW M4 GT3 that the BMW Junior Team will drive in the GT World Challenge Europe is ROWE Racing. Team principal Hans-Peter Naundorf’s outfit will compete with a second BMW M4 GT3, driven by BMW M works drivers Nick Catsburg, Augusto Farfus and Nick Yelloly. ROWE Racing will also start with two BMW M4 GT3 and a strong contingent of BMW M works drivers at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. The detailed driver line-up will be announced shortly. More quotes. Hans-Peter Naundorf, team principal ROWE Racing: “We are very happy to go into the 2022 season of the GT World Challenge Europe with such a strong squad of drivers. It is going to be an exciting year, with three very experienced BMW M works drivers in one car and the three guys from the BMW Junior Team in the other. That is a perfect mix. We are very proud that BMW M Motorsport has entrusted us with accompanying the next step of the BMW Junior Team this year. We followed their positive development last year. They improved consistently and hardly made a mistake at the toughest racetrack in the world. As such, the logical next step in their career is to move up into an international racing series. Nick Catsburg and Nick Yelloly have been among the guarantees of success for our team for a long time, and have emphatically demonstrated their class many times. Personally, I am thrilled to be working with Augusto Farfus for the first time in our seventh year with BMW. His success and history with BMW speak volumes and I find it particularly interesting how he still goes about his work with so much joy and enthusiasm.” Stefan Reinhold, team principal BMW M Team RMG: “After last year’s intensive test work, my whole team is now looking forward to going up against the strong opposition at the Nürburgring with the BMW M4 GT3. We know the car well and are confident that we will quickly become competitive on the Nordschleife. Despite that, it is obviously still a new car, so the preparatory races are extremely important for us, in order to prepare as well as possible for the big highlight – the 24-hour race. The expectations for our home race are very high. The collaboration with the BMW Junior Team is working excellently. In our second year together, we are a well-coordinated team, and the guys have huge potential as drivers. If we can work together to convert that into performance at the circuit, we can compete at the very front. Victory at our home race is still missing from the BMW M Team RMG collection.” Dan Harper: “The programme looks great! It is fantastic to return to the Nordschleife with BMW M Team RMG, and this time to do battle for overall victory in the 24-hour race. In the GT World Challenge Europe, I will get to know five circuits that are totally new to me. I am really looking forward to that. The 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps will obviously be a highlight, and it is great to be working with such an experienced and winning team there as ROWE Racing. Lining up against three experienced BMW M works drivers in the same team will be a very special challenge.” Max Hesse: “Our third year as the BMW Junior Team is going to be exciting, as a new car and a new race schedule await us. We have already gained some initial experience of the BMW M4 GT3 and are currently in Viareggio preparing for the start of the season. We already know BMW M Team RMG well and I am sure we will work well together on the Nordschleife again. I am really looking forward to working with our new partner team ROWE Racing and, of course, to the races in a fantastic series like the GT World Challenge Europe. We really wanted to race in this series. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport for the faith they are putting in us!” Neil Verhagen: “We have been preparing intensively, both physically and mentally, for weeks now, in order to be top fit come the start of the season. We can now hardly wait to get back out on track for the first tests. Our big goal for the Nordschleife is to challenge for overall victory in the 24-hour race. The GT World Challenge Europe with ROWE Racing is going to be a fantastic new experience for us. We are learning new racetracks and will go wheel to wheel with the best GT drivers in the world. I am sure we will learn an awful lot there.”\n"}

The BMW M2 CS Racing MotoGP™ Safety Car heads the fleet of powerful BMW M safety cars in the 2022 season, which begins on 6th March with the Grand Prix of Qatar. “M stands for Motorsport – something we are underlining with the new BMW M2 CS Racing MotoGP™ Safety Car,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “BMW M GmbH combines high-performance production automobiles and motorsport under one roof. It is for this reason that we selected a race car from our BMW M Motorsport range to be the new MotoGP™ Safety Car – an appropriate choice to mark the 50th anniversary. The BMW M2 CS Racing has been successful in a wide range of championships – and, as a thoroughbred race car, is perfectly suited to leading the field as the safety car in the pinnacle of motorcycle racing. We are looking forward to our 24th season as ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’ and to seeing the BMW M2 CS Racing in action as a safety car for the first time in Qatar.” “BMW M has been our partner since 1999 and, over the course of this long-term collaboration, has always thrilled us with new highlights,” added Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports. “With a safety car based on a real race car, BMW M is once again setting new benchmarks this year. The BMW M2 CS Racing MotoGP™ Safety Car shows how deeply rooted BMW M is in motorsport. It is also more proof of just how intensively BMW M GmbH brings its passion for motorsport to play in our partnership. We would like to congratulate BMW M on its 50th anniversary and are looking forward to an exciting new season together.” The BMW M2 CS Racing is part of BMW M Motorsport’s extensive range of race cars. It is successful in championships around the world, and there are also multiple international and national one-make cups featuring the BMW M2 CS Racing. BMW M Motorsport drivers and teams also score points towards the BMW Sports Trophy on their outings with the BMW M2 CS Racing. The competition is the only one of its kind in the world for drivers and teams who compete with BMW M race cars in various series and at renowned racing events. The most successful of them are rewarded with an attractive amount of prize money. As well as an engine generating up to 450 hp (depending on the version), the race car also has motorsport-specific driving aids like ABS and DSC, a mechanical limited-slip differential with pre-load and separate cooling, as well as specially manufactured drive shafts and a carbon roof. For its role as the MotoGP™ Safety Car, the BMW M2 CS Racing only required modifications in a few areas, including the addition of light bars and front lights. The livery of the new BMW M2 CS Racing MotoGP™ Safety Cars is a reference to the 50th anniversary and based on the anniversary logo of BMW M GmbH. Completing the BMW M fleet for the 2022 MotoGP™ season are the BMW M3 Competition Safety Car, the BMW M4 Competition Safety Car, the BMW M5 CS Safety Car, the BMW M8 Competition Gran Coupé Safety Car, the BMW X5 M Competition Medical Car, and two BMW M 1000 RR Safety Bikes. The fully-electric BMW i4 M50 Safety Car will also lead the field in the FIM Enel MotoE™ World Cup, the electric motorcycle series held on the MotoGP™ support programme. For more information about BMW M GmbH and the involvement as the ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’, see: www.bmw-m.com\n"}

{"prompt":"Conceived by Goodby Silverstein & Partners and directed by Bryan Buckley, the 60-second spot will air during the third commercial break of the first quarter. BMW to launch two All-New, fully electric vehicles in the U.S. next month – the BMW iX Sports Activity Vehicle and the four-door BMW i4 Gran Coupe.  ->","completion":" Woodcliff Lake, NJ. BMW will debut a new 60-second advertisement during the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 13, 2022, to showcase its All-New, fully electric BMW iX Sports Activity Vehicle, which arrives in the US next month. The star-studded spot features legendary actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Academy Award nominee Salma Hayek Pinault, and was directed by two-time Academy Award nominated director Bryan Buckley. It will air during the third commercial break of the first quarter of the game.Schwarzenegger stars as Zeus, the Greek god of lightning, and Hayek Pinault plays his wife, the goddess Hera, as they retire from Mt. Olympus to a quiet life in Palm Springs, California. However, the monotony of retirement quickly weighs on Zeus, who becomes frustrated by his struggles with earthly electronics and his nagging mortal neighbors’ constant requests to charge their electric golf carts and hedge trimmers. Meanwhile, Hera, the hero of the story, has fully acclimated and is thriving in retirement. In an effort to bring some excitement back into Zeus’s life, she gifts him with an all-electric BMW iX, which quickly helps reignite her husband’s electric mojo. The spot closes with the happy couple rocking down the road in their new BMW iX to Eddy Grant’s “Electric Avenue” while Zeus uses his electric power to change the traffic lights to green.“All-electric mobility is at the very heart of the BMW brand,” said Jens Thiemer, senior vice president, customer and brand, BMW AG. “There is no better place to make this statement than in front of one of the largest television audiences in the world, where viewers tune in as much for the commercials as they do for the game. With Arnold and Salma, we are able show the world the new BMW iX in a memorable and impactful way.”“The humor lies in this legendary god of lightning, who is supposed to be indestructible, battling with everyday electronics,” said Schwarzenegger. “It is only when his brilliant wife presents him with the gift of an all-electric BMW iX that Zeus is struck with the mighty power of electricity and is completely rejuvenated.”The spot was conceived by BMW’s lead U.S. creative agency, Goodby Silverstein & Partners, and directed by two-time Academy Award nominated director Bryan Buckley, highly acclaimed for his work on more than 65 Super Bowl commercials. The ad also marks Hayek Pinault’s debut in a Super Bowl spot and the first time she and Schwarzenegger have costarred in a national ad.“This is my first Super Bowl commercial—and the first time I’ve played a Greek goddess,” said Hayek Pinault. “Seventy-five percent of the decisions made in a marriage about where to spend the money are made by women, and in this commercial, it is the woman who decides on the right car to get her husband back on track. Of course, the commercial is entertaining, but there is also a real human truth to it.”“I’ve done 60-some-odd Super Bowl spots. I’ve never had more star power than these two,” said director Bryan Buckley. “When I first saw Schwarzenegger’s name on the script, I was in. And Salma—there is no one greater as an actress. It’s a movie in 60 seconds, and it’s on the biggest platform.”“Transcending sports, this iconic annual event isn’t just a championship game. It’s a cultural phenomenon where viewers pay even more attention when the action on the field stops,” said Rich Silverstein, co-founder and co-chairman of Goodby Silverstein & Partners. “There’s only one person on the planet who could say he’s Zeus, and that’s Arnold. And there’s only one brand worthy of being called the Ultimate Electric Driving Machine, and that’s BMW. We needed to showcase this in a big way, and that is what we’re doing on February 13.”Designed to provide more than just mortal mobility, the BMW iX brings together the fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology with the company’s latest developments in the fields of design, connectivity, digital services and sustainability. With 516 hp and a 0–60 time of only 4.6 seconds, the BMW iX offers an exhilarating driving experience with an EPA estimate of up to 324 miles of all-electric range and the latest in-vehicle technology, including 5G connectivity, a sweeping curved display that unites the 12.3-inch information display with a 14.9-inch central control display, and the debut of BMW iDrive 8, the company’s latest user-interface system. The BMW iX starts at $83,200 plus $995 destination and handling.“This is a pinnacle event in the U.S. and the perfect stage on which to introduce the BMW iX to our customers,” said Uwe Dreher, vice president, marketing, BMW of North America. “We have already seen a significant number of preorders for both the BMW iX and BMW i4, and a huge amount of excitement for these two new electric vehicles.”Alongside the BMW iX, BMW will also launch the fully electric BMW i4 four-door Gran Coupe in the U.S. next month as the company takes a major step toward its stated goal of reaching global sales of 50% electric vehicles by 2030.BMW’s last Super Bowl had appeared in 2015 and featured Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel as they marveled over BMW’s first fully electric production vehicle, the BMW i3. The BMW i3 was a pioneer of electromobility and later became one of the best-selling premium electric vehicles in the world.

Raised in Basel and Zurich, she was surrounded by music of all genres from a very young age. Since her graduation in jazz singing at Munich’s Academy of Music in 2018, Hannah Weiss’ career has steadily been gaining momentum with performances in various ensembles and concert projects.JuryThe jury, headed by Oliver Hochkeppel (journalist for music and cultural affairs, Süddeutsche Zeitung), consists of Heike Lies (Musicologist, Music and Music Theatre Division of the Department of Cultural Affairs of the state capital Munich ), Christiane Böhnke-Geisse (Director of schwere reiter Musik), Roland Spiegel (Editor and jazz expert at German broadcasting station Bayerischer Rundfunk BR‑KLASSIK) and Andreas Kolb (Editor-in-chief of JazzZeitung.de and nmz – neue musikzeitung). Artists and ensemblesMarch 8, 2022: Julia Hülsmann TrioBerlin-based pianist Julia Hülsmann is one of the select German musicians “who give fresh impetus to the world of European jazz”, said the jury of SWR Jazz Award as early as 2016. Hülsmann first made her mark with lyrical interpretations for the label ACT in collaboration with prominent vocalists such as Rebekka Bakken, Anna Lauvergnac and Roger Cicero. Since moving to ECM in 2008, she has to date released seven albums, all featuring her inimitable, delicate and completely pared-down performances on the piano interpreting her own compositions. At the heart of each project is her trio with bassist Marc Muellbauer and drummer Heinrich Köbberling, which has performed in this constellation for 20 years. This year, the current awardee of the German Jazz Prize and her trio will be on stage at the BMW Welt Jazz Award.March 22, 2022: Jacob Karlzon TrioSwedish musician Jacob Karlzon counts among the outstanding jazz pianists coming out of Scandinavia in recent years. Following a long period as accompanist of vocalist Viktoria Tolstoy, Karlzon made his name on the international stage with numerous projects of his own. Combining his passion for improvisation with unexpected, rock rhythms and an open style characteristic to Scandinavian jazz, he prefers the term “alternative artist” to jazz pianist. True to his own style, Karlzon’s albums to date show influences from Ravel to hard bop, from metal to EDM, merged effortlessly by his preference for minimalist melodies. He is currently in Munich, promoting his new album “Wanderlust”, released by Warner and featuring the trio’s other members, bassist Morten Ramsbøl and drummer Rasmus Kihlberg.April 5, 2022: Anat Fort TrioPianist Anat Fort ranks among the Israeli artists raised in New York that continue to put their mark on contemporary jazz. Fort has since returned to Israel, a move that in no way slowed down her international career. Since 2007, she has been publishing her albums at the Munich-based label ECM with her most recent album “Birdwatching” featuring Italian clarinetist Gianluigi Trovesi as star guest. As so many of her great jazz pianist colleagues, Fort prefers performing as part of a trio working together with bassist Gary Wand and drummer Roland Schneider. Various experiments including her most recent collaboration with tango guitarist and vocalist Shlomo Ydov notwithstanding, the trio has been her ensemble of choice for over 20 years and a constant throughout her artistic career. The resulting trust allows for unparalleled freedom of improvisation, as seen on their most recent album “Colour”, released by Sunnyside Records, and soon to be heard at BMW Welt.April 12, 2022: Giovanni Guidi QuintetWhile still a teenager, pianist Giovanni Guidi truly impressed trumpeter Enrico Rava, Italian super star of jazz, during Rava’s jazz workshops and has been his permanent accompanist ever since. In that capacity as well as increasingly with his own projects and ensembles, Guidi has since been making his name on the international stage. For his current programme “Avec le temps” he and his fellow trio members, Chicago-born bassist Joe Rehmer and Portuguese drummer João Lobo, were joined by two other prominent names of the Italian jazz world: woodwind player Francesco Bearzatti and guitarist Roberto Cecchetto. The ensemble prefers impressionist, lyrical and bluesy sounds, as seen in their homages to poet, composer and chansonnier Léo Ferré or the recently deceased trumpeter Tomasz Stańko.April 19, 2022: Marco Mezquida TrioPianist Marco Mezquida is one of the most versatile and most productive representatives of the Spanish jazz world. Known from a very young age as a “prodigy”, “workaholic at the piano” and “once-in-a-century musician” in his native country, this Menorca-born artist has, at the tender age of 34, recorded over 30 albums to date. He performs solo improvisation and delivers programmes with duos, trios or orchestras. With his inspiration coming from sources as far-ranging as Ravel, Skrjabin, Bach and traditional American jazz, Mezquida’s work is best described as a pioneering, modern interpretation of Spanish folklore. This can also be seen in his work with Flamenco guitarist Chicuelo, a project that was very successful both in Germany and on the international stage, or his most recent work “Talismán”, which he recorded with cellist Martín Meléndez and drummer and percussionist Aleix Tobias.April 26, 2022: Ashley Henry QuartetThe last of the evening concerts of this year’s BMW Welt Jazz Award will feature its youngest participant. 30-year-old London-based pianist Ashley Henry completed his studies at the Royal Academy of Music as recently as 2016. Widely known as a prodigy, Henry was offered the opportunity to perform alongside legends such as Terence Blanchard and Jean Toussaint that very same year and was invited as the youngest participant to date to play with Robert Glasper at the International Piano Trio Festival. His appointment as guest resident Musical Director at London jazz clubs “Jazz Café” and “Ronnie Scotts” and nominations for the Jazz FM Awards in two categories in addition to being named “Breakthrough Act of the Year” by Fader Magazine secured his big break in 2017. Adding to this, Ashley Henry’s acclaimed debut album “Beautiful Vinyl Hunter” further cemented his status as a multifaceted artist in 2019. \n"}

Artist Arash Hanaei and curator Morad Montazami have been named as winners of the BMW ART MAKERS programme. Following a call for applications, a shortlist was created by the jury members and the BMW ART MAKERS team, after which ten artist-curator duos were interviewed via video conference.The jury unanimously selected the artist-curator duo Arash Hanaei and Morad Montazami who won them over with their project entitled “Hantologie post-urbaine” (“Post-urban hauntology”). The dialogue fostered by the two applicants demonstrated their synergy and the importance of the curator’s contribution through his ability to take a step back when considering the chosen subject. The jury was impressed by the first series presented in the application that display the decision to create an installation that combines various visual systems and a masterful deep-dive into a futurist universe.“Hantologie post-urbaine” is a project that invites us to rethink our relationship with the utopian architecture of the 1960s and 1970s and the urban ecosystem of the suburbs that host them. This work is made up of still and moving computer images, evoking the digital culture through which architectural ghosts pass. Their socio-political ideal remains in a dream state, but lingers on through their physical substance. The emphasis is on two parallel worlds: the suburbs around the city and the virtual world created by big data.“As winners of the 2022 BMW ART MAKERS programme, we are honoured by the trust placed in us to successfully create an innovative installation that proposes poetry and a visual policy that considers the spectator’s emancipation, in an era of image “capture”, big data and algorithmic warfare.” Arash Hanaei & Morad MontazamiThe BMW ART MAKERS programme will enable them to carry out this project.Two heads are better than one. This partnership draws on the strength of a strong, like-minded duo to generate the trust and competitive spirit required for completing a major project from the initial idea to the end work. Alongside the artist, the curator performs the roles of artistic director, scenographer and designer and ensures the project is completed to artistic standards, timeframe and budget.“The human-machine relationship, creativity, innovation, support and commitment are all key BMW Group values. In these unpredictable times, this new art patronage programme speaks for itself: this artist-curator duo sparks an emotional conversation with our society and offers a different take through experimentation. We are looking forward to seeing what Arash Hanaei and Morad Montazami have created in relation to the post-urban and post-internet world,” Maryse Bataillard, Head of Corporate Communications and CSR, BMW Group France.

These 125 applications demonstrated a wide range of profiles and work. 43% of applicant duos were mixed, 35% were all-female and 22% all-male. 47% were French and 53% international, from more than thirty countries worldwide.The major trends that emerged reflected social issues. Many projects considered the environment and in particular trees and water. Society was the focus of proposals on post-colonialism, feminism, disease and its resilience. Technology was also a common theme, with a particular emphasis on artificial intelligence.Biographies of the winners Arash Hanaei is an artist who lives and works in Paris.

{"prompt":"As of February 1st 2022, Stefanie Wurst takes over the management of the MINI brand. Her predecessor Bernd Körber will now head BMW Product Management and the Connected Company. Strategic further development of the British premium brand with a focus on new markets and target groups as well as electromobility and digitalization will be consistently continued. ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group announces a personnel change at the top of the MINI brand. As of 1 February 1st 2022, Stefanie Wurst will take over the management of the British premium brand. She succeeds Bernd Körber, who has held this position since April 2019 and now assumes responsibility for the BMW Product Management and the Connected Company as of February 1st 2022.Stefanie Wurst returned to Munich after being CEO BMW Group Nederland since September 2018. Under her leadership, numerous sustainability issues were actively promoted. Among others, she successfully initiated the \"Electric City Drive\", which became a pilot project for approximately 100 BMW eDrive Zones in Europe, which support drivers of plug-in hybrid models in the use of the all-electric driving mode in inner city areas. \"Sustainability is a holistic task and an attitude that everyone feels committed to,\" says Stefanie Wurst.The share of electrified models in the total sales of the BMW Group in the Netherlands increased to a new record of 37 percent in 2021. At the same time, the fully-electric MINI Cooper SE accounted for 21.5 percent of all new registrations of the MINI brand in the Netherlands in the past year. At MINI this approach is reflected in an approach that considers sustainability along the entire value chain, from the extraction of raw materials to the production and operation of the vehicle to subsequent recycling. MINI is making great strides in the expansion of electromobility. In 2021, global sales of the fully-electric MINI Cooper SE were almost doubled. As early as the early 2030s, MINI will be making the transition to a fully electrified brand. Stefanie Wurst will contribute her experience in the field of holistic corporate management in the interaction of all disciplines and together with our trading partners. From 2014 to 2018, the graduate economist was responsible for BMW's marketing of the German automotive market. During this period, both the brand strength in general and the perception of innovation of the BMW brand, including the sustainability perception, increased. Prior to joining BMW Group, she held various senior positions internationally, including in Singapore for the Asian market. In her new role, she succeeds Bernd Körber, under whose direction the future strategy of the MINI brand was developed. Among other things, it includes a realignment of the product range, which includes electrified models as well as new offers in the crossover and premium compact segments. The next generation of the MINI Countryman will roll-off the production line at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig from 2023 – with both electric and internal combustion engines. In addition, MINI is stepping up its commitment to the Chinese automotive market, including the launch of local production. Production of a new generation of all-electric models from the brand will also begin there in 2023. MINI is thus taking another step towards becoming an all-electric brand.A central element of the realignment of MINI's brand image is the emphasis on diversity, tolerance, cosmopolitanism, optimism and enthusiasm for new things, which is expressed by the current campaign motto BIGLOVE. The positive emotionality divides the brand with the MINI community, in which individuality and a sense of community are harmoniously in sync with each other. Innovations in the field of digitalization and networking also contribute to the brand's future viability.This not only strengthens the relationship between customer and vehicle, but also the brand's connection to the global MINI community. With its strategic choices in the fields of product, brand and customer as well as technology and production, MINI has a solid basis for sustainable profitable growth of the brand.\n"}
{"prompt":"The first 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) proved to be a tough test for the BMW M Motorsport teams and the new BMW M4 GT3. After a race full of challenges, BMW M Team RLL’s two MOTUL BMW M4 GT3s crossed the finish line in seventh and ninth places in the GTD-PRO class.  ->","completion":" Daytona. The first 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) proved to be a tough test for the BMW M Motorsport teams and the new BMW M4 GT3. After a race full of challenges, BMW M Team RLL’s two MOTUL BMW M4 GT3s crossed the finish line in seventh and ninth places in the GTD-PRO class. Both cars suffered issues with their underbodies early in the race. Work had to be carried out on the rear diffusor multiple times which cost a lot of time and saw both cars drop well down the field. Turner Motorsport made an impressive fightback in the GTD class and was running in the top five until they were forced to retire after an incident in the night. “That was a tough race,” said Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport. “We wanted to keep the number of mistakes to a minimum and, if possible, to get all the BMW M4 GT3s through the race without any incidents. Unfortunately, we did not quite manage that. The GTD car run by Turner Motorsport was unable to finish the race after contact, and both of BMW M Team RLL’s cars encountered problems and ended the race in seventh and ninth place. Although we did a lot of test kilometres during the development phase, this showed that an outing under race conditions poses additional challenges. We must work together to improve the reliability, operations and performance, as we were unable to match the pace of the leaders at any point in the race. We will now analyse all the findings to ensure that we return to the front again at the 12 Hours of Sebring. I would like to congratulate Team Pfaff Motorsports on its victory in the first race of the new GTD-PRO class. Today was my last race outing with BMW M Motorsport. I would have liked to have bid farewell with a top result. I want to thank all my colleagues, the teams and drivers for the trustworthy cooperation over the past few years.” Sharing the driving duties in the #25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 were John Edwards, Connor De Phillippi (both USA), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Jesse Krohn (FIN). They finished seventh in their class after 698 laps. The second car, with Philipp Eng (AUT), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) at the wheel, came home ninth in the GTD-PRO class. In the GTD class, the #96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3 started from the back of the field but they went on the offensive in the first few hours and managed to fight their way back into the top five. Alternating in the cockpit were Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley, Michael Dinan (all USA) and BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER). The car was damaged in a collision in the night however, and consequently had to be parked up in the garage. BMW M Team RLL and Turner Motorsport now have roughly six weeks until the second highlight of this season’s IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Sebring (USA). They will be joined there by Paul Miller Racing with a BMW M4 GT3 in the GTD class. Focus on the BMW M anniversary and BMW M Endurance Challenge.On the support programme for the Rolex 24 At Daytona, BMW M Motorsport and BMW of North America marked 50 years of BMW M with a host of highlights. Immediately before the start of the race, there was a parade of vintage and current BMW M cars, including a BMW M1 from 1980. Three race cars that made history by winning IMSA races were on display at the Rolex 24 Heritage Exhibition in the Daytona Fan Zone: the BMW 3.0 CSL from 1975, the 2015 BMW Z4 GTLM, and the BMW M8 GTE that triumphed at Daytona in 2019. The BMW M Endurance Challenge took place on Friday. The four-hour race, round one of this season’s IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge, was started by Timo Resch, Vice President Customer, Brand and Sales at BMW M GmbH, in his role as Grand Marshal. Victory went to Team RS1. Turner Motorsport also impressed with its two BMW M4 GT4s and made it onto the podium, with Bill Auberlen and Dillon Machavern (both USA) finishing third. Their team-mates Robby Foley, Michael Dinan and Vincent Barletta (all USA) were fifth. Quotes after the 24 Hours of Daytona: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW M Team RLL): “That was a long day for us. It was the first race with the new car for our team. Prior to this, we had only had one short test at Daytona in December 2021 and were a little surprised that we did not have the problems back then that have slowed us down here in Rolex 24. A big thank you goes to my team, the drivers, BMW M Motorsport, and all those who never gave up during the past 36 hours and tried to get the best possible out of the car. We now have a very long to do list which we must work through in order to challenge at the front in Sebring.” John Edwards (#25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, 7th place GTD-PRO class): “That was a difficult race for us from the start. We did not have the necessary pace, and then came the issues with the diffusor. The result is obviously not what we wanted, but I am very proud of the guys, who never gave up. Seventh place still earned us some decent points in the overall standings. Hopefully we can up our game in Sebring and take a step forward in the championship.” Marco Wittmann (#24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, 9th place GTD-PRO class): “That was not the race we were hoping for. Despite that, we never lost our fantastic team spirit. After the early problems, we tried to view the race as a test, gain experience and get the car through to the finish. It is obviously a shame that we lost an awful lot of time, first through the damage to the diffusor and then later through a puncture and its consequences. Nevertheless, we have a lot to build on looking ahead to the coming races. Hopefully things will run smoother in the future!” Jens Klingmann (#96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3, DNF GTD class): “For the IMSA season, the 24 Hours of Daytona is pretty much the equivalent of the Super Bowl – the highlight of the season and a really tough test at the same time. There were four of us in one Turner Motorsport car for the first time, and we had fought back strongly to make it into the top five until our retirement. My team-mates were all basically very happy with the driveability, user-friendliness and ergonomics of the BMW M4 GT3. That gives me reason to be positive. It is obviously a shame that we had to park the car up after our contact, but we showed that we have the potential to compete at the very front of the field in our class.”\n"}

For BMW M Motorsport and BMW of North America, this weekend’s Rolex 24 At Daytona (USA) represents one of the highlights of the season, even this early in the year. The new BMW M4 GT3 is set to make its debut at the endurance classic in Florida. BMW M Team RLL and Turner Motorsport were in action last weekend at the test and qualifying event, Roar Before the 24, where they secured their start positions for the 24-hour race. The big race is the perfect stage on which to mark the 50-year anniversary of BMW M GmbH, which will celebrate the occasion with a top-class programme both on and off the track. The sporting foundations for the coming weekend were laid over the last few days, within the many test sessions and the 100-minute qualifying race. The two MOTUL BMW M4 GT3s run by BMW M Team RLL qualified 12th and 13th in the GTD-PRO class. At the wheel of the #24 car were BMW M works drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR), gaining as much experience as possible. Their team-mates Marco Wittmann (GER) and Philipp Eng (AUT) were only in action in the test sessions. In the #25 car, Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) skipped the qualifying race, while John Edwards and Connor De Phillippi (both USA) shared the cockpit. Turner Motorsport, with drivers Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley, Michael Dinan (all USA) and Jens Klingmann (GER) in the #96 BMW M4 GT3, failed to finish in the GTD class following a collision. As a result, they will start from the back of the field at the weekend. “The 24 Hours of Daytona is a very special race for BMW M Motorsport in many regards – and for me personally,” said Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport. “For the first time this season, the 50-year anniversary of BMW M will be duly celebrated, thanks to the efforts of BMW of North America at the racetrack. From a sporting perspective, we are extremely excited about our IMSA debut with the BMW M4 GT3. We have already seen at the Roar that setting up and classifying a totally new GT car can pose challenges that need a little time to master. However, the drivers and teams are constantly making progress and will continue to improve over the course of the race weekend. I am confident that we will see good performances at my final race as Head of BMW M Motorsport. I am really looking forward to it.” MOTUL is partner of BMW M Motorsport and lends its name to the BMW M Team RLL cars. “After two years of successful partnership, including the 2020 24h Daytona win, we are very proud to continue our adventure together,“ said Romain Grabowski, Head of Brand MOTUL. “This is not only a partnership renewal, it is a real challenge for our two companies with the introduction of the brand new MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 as we have both been working together on its technical development. We are hoping to provide BMW fans from all over the world with great excitement as well as top quality engine oil, allowing them to extract maximum power output from their BMW engines while benefiting from maximal protection.” Fellow partners Akrapovič, H&R, Michelin and Puma are also working closely with BMW M Motorsport. They are joined by BMW of North America’s partners BMW M Performance Driving School and Global Medical Response and BMW M Team RLL’s partners Aero and Rousseau. Special highlights in support programme.As well as the race action, BMW M Motorsport and BMW of North America will also mark 50 years of BMW M with a host of highlights on the support programme for the Rolex 24 At Daytona.

Four BMW M4 GT4s run by the Turner Motorsport, Stephen Cameron Racing and Random Vandals Racing teams will compete in the race on Friday. The field will be led by BMW M3 and BMW M4 safety cars.

The Rolex 24 starts at 19:40 CET on Saturday 29th January. Quotes ahead of the 24-hour race: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW M Team RLL): “We are very proud to have played a role in a good portion of the history of BMW M Motorsport. For us, signing with BMW back in 2008 for the 2009 season was a huge honour – so for us to be part of this 50th anniversary of BMW M is really something special. We are super excited about racing the new BMW M4 GT3, once again introducing a new race car to BMW fans like we have done with the M3 GT, Z4 GTLM, M6 GTLM and M8 GTE. We have been fortunate to have success with each of those cars which makes it exciting to embark on this new project and hopefully have more success with this great new chassis in 2022. BMW M Motorsport has assembled another great driver line-up and our drivers will have to give us their best. There are a lot of good drivers in GTD PRO and we’re looking forward to the competition.” Sheldon van der Linde (#24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “Not a great qualifying race for us. Obviously, we would have liked to be further up on the grid. Our job is to make sure that everything runs smoothly within the team. For me personally it’s the first race with the RLL team, so I was getting to know everybody during these days. My first time with BMW M Motorsport at Daytona means there’s a lot left for me to learn.” Nick Yelloly (#24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “We could see in the qualifying race where we are at the moment – and that’s not where we want to be. Now we have to stick our heads together in the days to come. In general, it’s pleasure to drive the BMW M4 GT3 and work with BMW M Team RLL. Now we just have to find some speed.” John Edwards (#25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “The qualifying race didn’t end up great but fortunately there are no points awarded for it. Now we have a week ahead of us where we’ll put our heads down and prepare for the 24-hour race to go for the result when it counts.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “Not the result we wanted, obviously. We executed well and had a clean race. We just didn’t have the package to challenge for top positions. Let’s hope it will be different next weekend and we can put on a fight.” Jens Klingmann (#96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3): “For us the focus was on set-up work. It’s important to find a good balance between racing day and night. There are still a lot of things to learn and discover with the new car. I think we made good progress and the car is in a good window. It is easy to drive which is important for a 24-hour race. Now we just got to make it fast. I am confident we’ll get there soon.”\n"}

BMW M Motorsport is counting on continuity in the driver line-up for the 2022 season.

All 19 drivers are already familiar faces from previous years in the BMW M Motorsport family. Their experience and class are particularly crucial for the many new challenges that BMW M Motorsport is facing. “2022 is a year of numerous new challenges for BMW M Motorsport – so it was all the more important for us to count on experience, class and continuity when selecting the BMW M works drivers,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “In the season ahead, the new BMW M4 GT3 will go up against top-quality opposition in the world’s greatest GT races for the first time. Development and testing of our BMW M LMDh is proceeding apace, with the aim of battling for overall wins at the major classic races in the IMSA series from 2023. For this important project, we need drivers who really know BMW M Motorsport, the cars, the engineers, the race series and circuits, and who can concentrate fully on regularly squeezing the best possible performance from the overall package. We are convinced that we are ready for the 2022 season with our line-up.” Details about the driver allocations for the relevant BMW M Motorsport teams and race series will be announced at a later date. The BMW M Motorsport driver line-up no longer includes Martin Tomczyk and Maximilian Günther (both GER). Tomczyk has called time on his racing career and is pursuing new professional challenges, while Günther is competing for Nissan in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. BMW M Motorsport would like to thank both drivers for the time spent together. The BMW M Motorsport works drivers 2022 in alphabetical order: Nick Catsburg (NED)Date of birth15 February 1988Place of birthAmersfoort (NED)BMW M Motorsport driver since2011Major successesVictory at 24h Nürburgring 2020, Intercontinental GT Champion 2020, victory at 24h Spa-Francorchamps 2015 Jake Dennis (GBR)Date of birth16 June 1995Place of birthNuneaton (GBR)BMW M Motorsport driver since2021Major successes3rd place in Formula E drivers’ championship 2021, 2nd place at Bathurst 12 Hour 2019 Connor De Phillippi (USA)Date of birth25 December 1992Place of birthSan Clemente (USA)BMW M Motorsport driver since2018Major successesVictory at 24h Daytona 2019, victory at 24h Nürburgring 2017, ADAC GT Masters Champion 2016 Stef Dusseldorp (NED)Date of birth27 September 1989Place of birthWinterswijk (NED)BMW M Motorsport driver since2016Major successes6th place 24h Nürburgring 2021, 5th place 24h Nürburgring 2019, 3rd place FIA GT1 World Championship 2012 John Edwards (USA)Date of birth11 March 1991Place of birthLouisville (USA)BMW M Motorsport driver since2013Major successesVictory at 24h Daytona 2020, GTLM drivers’ title in IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup 2020 Philipp Eng (AUT)Date of birth28 February 1990Place of birthSalzburg (AUT)BMW M Motorsport driver since2016Major successesVictory at 24h Daytona 2019, victory at 24h Spa-Francorchamps 2016 & 2018 Augusto Farfus (BRA)Date of birth03 September 1983Place of birthCuritiba (BRA)BMW M Motorsport driver since2007Major successesVictory at 24h Daytona 2019 & 2020, Intercontinental GT Champion 2020, victory at FIA GT World Cup Macau 2018, victory at 24h Nürburgring 2010 Timo Glock (GER)Date of birth18 March 1982Place of birthLindenfels (GER)BMW M Motorsport driver since2013Major successesGP2 Champion 2007, 5 DTM wins, 3 Formula 1 podiums Daniel Harper (GBR) – BMW Junior TeamDate of birth08 December 2000Place of birthHillsborough (GBR)BMW M Motorsport driver since2020Major successes1 GT4 class win at 24h Nürburgring, 2 overall wins in Nürburgring Endurance Series Max Hesse (GER)– BMW Junior TeamDate of birth23 July 2001Place of birthWernau (GER)BMW M Motorsport driver since2020Major successes1 GT4 class win at 24h Nürburgring, 2 overall wins in Nürburgring Endurance Series Erik Johansson (SWE)Date of birth16 October 1996Place of birthVäxjö (SWE)BMW M Motorsport driver since2019Major successes2nd place in Italian GT Championship 2019, 1 win in ADAC GT Masters Jens Klingmann (GER)Date of birth16 July 1990Place of birthHeidelberg (GER)BMW M Motorsport driver since2014Major successesChampion Formel BMW Deutschland 2007, 3rd place at 24h Nürburgring 2020 Jesse Krohn (FIN)Date of birth03 September 1990Place of birthNurmijärvi (FIN)BMW M Motorsport driver since2014Major successesGT Champion in Asian Le Mans Series 2017\/18, victory at 24h Daytona 2020, GTLM drivers’ title in IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup 2020 Alexander Sims (GBR)Date of birth15 March 1988Place of birthLondon (GBR)BMW M Motorsport driver since2014Major successesVictory at 24h Nürburgring 2020, victory at Petit Le Mans 2017, victory at 24h Spa-Francorchamps 2016 Bruno Spengler (CAN)Date of birth23 August 1983Place of birthSchiltigheim (FRA)BMW M Motorsport driver since2012Major successesDTM Champion 2012, 2nd place at 24h Daytona 2015, 2nd place at 12h Sebring 2016, victory at 6h Road Atlanta 2020 Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)Date of birth13 May 1999Place of birthJohannesburg (RSA)BMW M Motorsport driver since2019Major successesVictory at 9h Kyalami 2020, 3rd place at 24h Nürburgring 2020, 2nd place at 24h Nürburgring 2021 Neil Verhagen (USA) – BMW Junior TeamDate of birth18 February 2001Place of birthRidgefield (USA)BMW M Motorsport driver since2020Major successes1 GT4 class win at 24h Nürburgring, 2 overall wins in Nürburgring Endurance Series Marco Wittmann (GER)Date of birth24 November 1989Place of birthFürth (GER)BMW M Motorsport driver since2012Major successesDTM Champion 2014 & 2016, 2nd place at 24h Nürburgring 2021, 3rd place at 24h Daytona 2021 Nick Yelloly (GBR)Date of birth03 December 1990Place of birthStafford (GBR)BMW M Motorsport driver since2019Major successesVictory at 24h Nürburgring 2020, 2nd place at 8h Indianapolis 2020 \n"}

The new flagship from BMW M Motorsport has passed the endurance test in the desert. Following test races last season and successful FIA homologation, the 24H Dubai (UAE) from Friday to Saturday marked the first race appearance for the new BMW M4 GT3 in the hands of BMW M Motorsport teams. ST Racing and Schubert Motorsport competed with a total of three BMW M4 GT3s at the season-opener in the 24H Series. After 24 hours of racing featuring numerous Code 60 periods and a sandstorm on Saturday morning, all three cars reached the finish line on their racing debut. ST Racing secured ninth place with the #28 BMW M4 GT3 in the top category, the GT3 class. The car was driven by Jon Miller (USA), Nick Wittmer (CAN), Louis-Philippe Montour (CAN) and Chandler Hull (USA). Schubert Motorsport suffered a setback early in the race when the #30 BMW M4 GT3 was damaged after contact from another competitor. The subsequent long repair break saw the #30 fall way back. After 24 hours, BMW M works driver Nick Yelloly (GBR), Jordan Witt (GBR), Marcel Lenerz (GER) and Jens Liebhauser (GER) crossed the line tenth in the GT3 class. The #1 car from ST Racing, competing in the Pro-Am class, was the best-placed BMW M4 GT3 in the field for a large part of the race and was on course for a podium in its class. However, a technical problem then cost the car positions, although it was possible to carry out repairs. The #1, driven by Samantha Tan (CAN), Bryson Morris, Anthony Lazzaro, Harry Gottsacker and Tyler Maxson (all USA), then finished fifth in the Pro-Am class. The next highlight for the BMW M4 GT3 is scheduled to take place in two weeks in North America. At the season-opener in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series), the legendary 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), BMW M Team RLL and Turner Motorsport will be competing with the new GT car. BMW M Motorsport teams were also competing in Dubai with the BMW M4 GT4 and the BMW M2 CS Racing. They secured multiple podium finishes in their categories. The RHC Jorgensen-Strom by Century team reached third place on the rostrum with the #450 BMW M4 GT4 in the GT4 class. The #429 of Century Motorsport and the #451 from Team AVIA Sorg Rennsport were right behind in fourth and fifth positions. In the TCX category, Cogemo\/TLRT finished second with the #255 BMW M2 CS Racing, ahead of Yeeti Racing with the #208 BMW M2 CS Racing in third position. Schubert Motorsport claimed sixth place in the same class with the #200 BMW M2 CS Racing. Reactions to the 24H Dubai. Achim Klein, BMW M Motorsport Project Lead BMW M4 GT3: “Those were some exciting days for us here in Dubai. The first official racing appearance for a new car is always something special, and even though the turbulent events during the race meant that the final results did not entirely meet our expectations, we can draw some positive conclusions. Two of the three competing BMW M4 GT3s were brought to Dubai straight from production, where they were received by the BMW M Motorsport teams. We also gathered plenty of valuable knowledge in Dubai, which will help us as we continue to work on the new car in its debut season. ST Racing and Schubert Motorsport provided crucial input for this. Now we are looking forward to the next highlight with the new BMW M4 GT3, the 24 Hours of Daytona in two weeks.” Kenneth Tan, ST Racing Team Principal: “The BMW M4 GT3 is potentially very competitive. We saw it in the early stages of the race; we were in the top five for quite a while and in the first half of the race we always were up in the overall top ten, so we know that the BMW M4 GT3 has the potential. At the moment, our car is still not there obviously. We just got the car straight from the factory and started working with it here at the track. We have a long list of things we want to do to develop it further for the next race at Mugello and I am very excited about that because I know where we can get this car to. The other part is of course our team. It has expanded and we needed to work together in a GT3 setting and we did that. We worked really well. We achieved the objectives we came here for. It would have been nice to be on the podium but we always knew that it’s a new car and that there are so many unknowns at the beginning. We finished the race and that’s amazing. I am very happy.” Torsten Schubert, Schubert Motorsport Team Principal: “We knew that the first race would be a challenge. We began testing on Tuesday here in Dubai. It was important for us to work with the car under racing conditions. That is better than any rollout where you are working alone out on the track. We have learned a lot. Unfortunately, there was an accident when we were hit by a competitor. A top ten finish in the overall standings would otherwise have been possible, and I could hardly have wished for a better result than that. The BMW M4 GT3 is a very balanced car. Apart from a few minor issues, which you always get with a new car, we had no problems. I am particularly pleased with our performance with our BMW M2 CS Racing. This was the first time that I had driven in a 24-hour race with my two sons as a three-driver line-up. We are happy that we made it through to the finish with virtually no hiccups” Nick Wittmer, #28 BMW M4 GT3, ST Racing: “This was my first time driving a GT3 and for a team that wants to buy a GT3 this car is very user-friendly. It did not take me much time to look around at all the buttons. It is very easy to learn and I really like the functions on the BMW M4 GT3. A lot of functions were new to me so they were things I had to learn. Despite not having the GT3 experience it was very fun and easy to drive the BMW M4 GT3 on track. For sure we need to develop the set-ups and all that by tracks and learn more about the car. I did a lot of track-time out there, I learnt a lot throughout the week and improved a lot. Overall, we just need to fine-tune a little bit and we will be up there for sure. We have a very strong car.” Samantha Tan, #1 BMW M4 GT3, ST Racing: “It was incredible to be one of the first drivers to race this car officially in the world. It was quite overwhelming to switch from the GT4 to the GT3 but with the focus on us teams I feel that I adapted very quickly to the BMW M4 GT3. The biggest difference for me was all the technology, how much we could really fine-tune all the different settings for the drivers. Obviously there were still a lot of things that I needed to learn this weekend but overall it was great. I think that I ran a very great pace throughout the night. The car has a lot of potential. We just need to put in more work and more development on our side and I will think we will have a great car for the next race at Mugello.” Nick Yelloly, #30 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport: “We take some positives with us moving to Daytona. We know that the car can work very well; all the development and testing that we did over the past 18 months paid off well so I am very happy about that. Now it is just about fine-tuning everything with the new car and I am sure that it will be a multiple race and championship winner in the years to come. Even if the final result was a bit frustrating considering the pace that we could show, especially at the end, I am pretty happy. The team did a fantastic job. Only one small roll-out and then straight away finishing a 24-hour race is a great achievement.” \n"}

Internationally renowned Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei created the Digital Art Mode in the year of the 50th anniversary of BMW Cultural Engagement. Held in Las Vegas from January 5‑8, 2022, CES will be the first event to showcase the Digital Art Mode inside a BMW iX M60.The Digital Art Mode is part of the all-new My Modes: Their unique moments enhance BMW’s driving experience by creating a synergy of the vehicle’s functions and its interior design. Depending on the driving situation and the overall mood, a holistic user experience featuring both a functional and an emotional level can be created at the touch of a button or via voice control. To that end, drive control and steering control, mood lighting and sound as well as the color scheme and graphics of the BMW Curved Display are precisely synchronized.A quantum leap for BMW Cultural Engagement: After 50 years and hundreds of international cooperations, BMW will now introduce art into its vehicles. The novel Digital Art Mode offers an additional option for drivers to personalize their driving experience according to their preferences and interests and enjoy culture in their mobile day-to-day lives. The Digital Art Mode is the result of an intensive collaborative process of BMW Group Design and the Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei, whose art creates fascinating and sensual, immersive moments. In 2017, Cao Fei designed the 18th BMW Art Car using the M6 GT3, the first of its kind to be entirely digital in the history of this unique collection of mobile artworks. With this very first incorporation of digital art in an automobile, Cao Fei and the BMW Group are now taking the next step together.The new BMW iX M60 home to a premiere: a digital artwork symbolizing the deep connection of humankind and nature.For the very first time, the Digital Art Mode can be experienced in the new BMW iX M60 at this year’s CES. The feature will be made available for other BMW series vehicles in 2022. Selected models will be available with the Digital Art Mode as a customized optional feature configurated directly ex work, while others can be retrofitted via remote software upgrades integrated into the user interface. “With the new Digital Art Mode, BMW Cultural Engagement reaches new heights while creating something entirely unique,” said Christoph Grote, Senior Vice President Digital Car, BMW Group, “For the very first time, we are making digital art an integral part of the modern driving experience in a car and use innovative technology to transform mobility into an individual, highly exclusive and emotional experience.”The artwork to be presented on the BMW Curved Display and created by Cao Fei, speaks of the continuous change of a globalized and interconnected world and is named “Quantum Garden”. Galaxies of visual spaces filled with dots, light beams and nebulae constantly moving towards and away from each other at varying speeds while growing and shrinking again and again. They express the mostly invisible but continuous links connecting people, groups and systems that affect each other even over great distances and, in doing so, also modify their surroundings. In her artwork – produced especially for the Digital Art Mode – Cao Fei combines her reflections on these global connections and correlations with the pursuit of a collaborative form of what in Asian cultures is often described as the perfect harmony of humankind and nature. The artist herself explains this eternal quest as follows: “The desire to connect is omnipresent. It is about how we can synergize with the world, live with nature and renew our energy.”“2017 was a spectacular year, a time when humanity embraced the advent of artificial intelligence. During this time, I employed augmented reality to create the 18th BMW Art Car, a car with an aura of its own, enhanced by new technologies. 2021 was a difficult and special year. While humanity was stuck and helpless, the world has been moving determinedly into the metaverse, the age of virtual immersion. This is the very moment when I was once again invited to participate in BMW's groundbreaking Digital Art Mode,” said Cao Fei. “My work ‘Quantum Garden’ gives the BMW driver the chance to experience the ever-changing digital landscapes of a multifaceted universe in a screen world, where abstract poetry and sensory pixels intersect. Its network of open-ended spectra are connecting our hearts to the call of goodwill from the depths of the universe.”In her own words, Cao Fei describes “Quantum Garden” as “a poetic collection of universes, countless atoms, nebulae, and thousands of fast-moving beams of light from the depths of the universe, and those trailing strings of galaxies, growing larger and smaller, intersecting and extending, combining and separating, perceiving and listening to each other, around a myriad of constantly rotating centers. In a multidimensional universe, the trajectory is non-linear, the journey has no end, only the freedom to switch between the micro and macro worlds, to wander, to explore, and to evolve.”New ways of experiencing culture: BMW Group once again pioneeringThe Digital Art Mode was created in the anniversary year of BMW Group Cultural Engagement. For 50 years, BMW has been assuming its social responsibility in the world of culture with its partnerships and initiatives. In doing so, hundreds of long-term cooperations have become an integral part of the company’s social sustainability. Many of its projects have begun exploring the potential inherent in digitalization to expand the scope of BMW Cultural Engagement, develop new forms of artistic expression and reach new audiences.Digital art by Cao Fei: from the racetrack to the BMW Curved DisplayWhen Cao Fei designed the BMW Art Car in 2017, BMW Group once again pioneered the design of innovative cultural experiences. For the very first time, a vehicle was transformed into a rolling sculpture by using augmented reality. Cao Fei’s BMW Art Car included three components: a film about a spiritual time traveler, a carbon black BMW M6 GT3 and an augmented reality installation consisting of multicolored light particles made visible with the help of a custom-made app programmed for the occasion. Every time the app was used near the race car, the screen of the smartphone displayed floating, ever-changing light strips above and around the BMW M6 GT3 – a reflection of the rapid change of the artist’s home country as seen on the 18th BMW Art Car.Cao Fei sees her work on the new Digital Art Mode as a direct continuation of her creative process in collaboration with the BMW Group. Designing a race car with augmented reality will now be followed by integrating digital art into the interior of series vehicles. \n"}
{"prompt":"All-wheel drive is an advantage in any traffic situation. But what four driven wheels are really capable of can only be experienced off the beaten track - and on snow. On an excursion with the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman, outstanding power and the ALL4 system provide ideal conditions for enjoying the white landscape in an extremely sporty way. ->","completion":" Munich. Snow is much more than a collection of frozen water droplets. Its crystal lattice structure depends on the temperature and humidity when the flakes form. At its best, snow is loose, powdery and white. When it falls from the sky in the right places, preferably mountainous ones, it forms the basis for attractive leisure activities such as skiing, snowshoeing or sledding. Likewise, the beautiful snow can provide an extra dose of skiing fun. The prerequisite for this is some skill with the accelerator pedal, steering wheel and brake, as well as the right vehicle. The MINI John Cooper Works Countryman The standard equipment of the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman also includes a sports brake system with four-piston fixed calliper disc brakes at the front and single-piston fist calliper disc brakes at the rear wheels. It can also be fitted with an Adaptive Suspension as an option.Driving dynamically over mountain passes and serpentines, the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman quickly reaches its optimum operating temperature even in wintry weather - and after about 50 kilometres in an easterly direction, one of Bavaria's most popular sights. Neuschwanstein Castle, not far from Füssen, was commissioned by the Bavarian King Ludwig II, who first moved in there 15 years after construction began in 1869, but died just two years later. Since then, his fairytale castle has repeatedly been used as a film set. It can be impressively photographed from a variety of perspectives, which is why it can sometimes get a little crowded on the streets around the castle hill.Following this extremely popular stopover, it's time to get back to solitude - for example in the Ammergau Alps, Bavaria's largest nature reserve. The extensive region stretches between the rivers Lech and Loisach. To the south, the Zwischentoren valley in the Außerfern region separates the Ammergau Alps from the Lechtal Alps. To the north, they merge smoothly into the Alpine foothills. In search of fresh snow, the route leads from here over the border into Austria, past the Plansee lake and on to Ettal, where the monastery of the same name, a world-class cultural monument, can be visited. Even on mountain roads that have not yet been cleared of snow, the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman unfalteringly makes its way as dusk quickly sets in. The adaptive LED headlights with variable light distribution and matrix function for the high beam, available as an optional extra, optimise visibility and thus safety both in the dark and in heavy snow.Those who spend the night in the Ammergau Alps can not only look forward to a fantastically beautiful winter landscape the following day, but also to a real programme of contrasts. A walk along the almost 85-kilometre-long meditation trail between the Wieskirche church in Steingaden and Linderhof Castle in Graswangtal near Ettal promises a relaxing experience of nature. Afterwards, the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman with its irresistible driving sound, even when idling, is already waiting to storm up the next snowy pass road. \n"}

A little more than one and a half years have passed since Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) was seriously injured in a handbike accident in June 2020 in Italy. In his long recovery process, the BMW Group Ambassador shows his well-known fighting spirit. The 55-year old has meanwhile left hospital and continues his rehabilitation partly at home. In an interview, his wife Daniela Zanardi speaks about the current situation. Five months after her first interview in July 2021, Daniela Zanardi again would like to use this opportunity to address the public and answer questions about the status of Alex’ recovery. Daniela, the sympathy you receive from all over the world is certainly still very high? Daniela Zanardi: “Yes, we still get a lot of messages and especially on Alex’s 55th birthday in October it was overwhelming how many people have sent him their best wishes, also via social media. We are very grateful to see how many people all over the world have Alex in their thoughts. This great sympathy shows how much Alex’s recovery touches the people. For this reason, we have decided to offer the public an insight into his current recovery process for the second time with this interview. At the same time, we appreciate everybody’s understanding that, apart from this, we cannot respond to the many requests about this health and we also ask everybody to respect our privacy. Because our highest priority is to accompany Alex on his way with our full energy.” What can you say about the recovery process? How is Alex these days? Zanardi: “The recovery continues to be a long process. The rehabilitation programme led by doctors, physiotherapists, neuropsychologists and speech therapists has enabled steady progress. Of course, setbacks are there and can still occur. Sometimes you also have to make two steps back in order to make one step forward. But Alex proves again and again that he is a real fighter.” … who has reached an important milestone! Zanardi: “Yes, indeed. An important step was that Alex was able to leave hospital a few weeks ago and is back at home with us now. We had to wait very long for this and are very happy that it was possible now, even if there are still temporary stays in special clinics planned for the future to carry out special rehabilitation measures on site.” How did Alex settle at home? Zanardi: “Very well. After the long time in hospital it is important for him to be back with his family and in his familiar environment. You also have to consider that, due to the Corona situation, Alex had only people with face masks and in protective equipment around him for one and a half years. In addition, due to the comprehensive and important protective measures in the clinic, the visiting possibilities are, of course, very restricted.” What does that mean exactly? Zanardi: “Alex hasn’t met friends and part of the family for one and a half years. Only me, our son and Alex’s mother could visit him, but always only one person per day and this only for one and a half hours. All this did not help to make the situation easier for Alex. Therefore it helps that he is now at home with us, even if also at home he currently can only be with the closest family as Corona numbers are increasing again. But we are with Alex all day, he is in his familiar environment and thus could return a little bit to normality. This gives him additional power. We are very grateful to the medical staff in the clinics he has been treated in. The doctors, care personnel, therapists and everybody being involved have done so much for Alex and continue to accompany us in his recovery process. In the clinics, Alex is in very good hands, but his own home still is his own home.” What can you tell us about his daily programme and routine? Zanardi: “It varies. Different programmes Alex did in hospital, are continued at home now. During the week, a therapist works with him and they do physical, neurological and logopedical exercises. In regards of his physical condition, there is a lot of progress. Alex has more and more strength in the arms, that has increased a lot. And, other than in hospital where he was in bed a lot, Alex now spends most of the day in the wheel chair with us. He just rests a bit in the afternoon after lunch.” What are the further expectations for his recovery process? Zanardi: “You still can’t predict how his recovery will further develop. It is still a long and challenging way that Alex tackles with a lot of fighting spirit. It is a big help for him and us that we receive so much support on this way, not only from the doctors and therapists that intensively work with him. Our friends are always there for us. This includes the BMW Group family which we can always count on and that is firmly at our side also in this difficult time. We are very grateful to everyone for that and for so much more because these strong ties give us additional energy. This also goes for the continued sympathy we receive from racing drivers, fans and acquaintances from all over the world. We would like to express a big Grazie to all who send their good thoughts and power to Alex. We wish everybody a merry Christmas and all the best for the new year.”\n"}

In preparation for the 2022 season of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad Motorsport carried out its first winter test. The two BMW teams – BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Bonovo action BMW Racing Team – took to the track in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, this week. In the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Michael van der Mark (NED) continued his work on the BMW M 1000 RR as he looks to take another step forward next season after one win and a further two podiums in 2021. Scott Redding (GBR) used the test days to familiarise himself with his future bike and team. The Brit had gained his first experience on his new bike during a private test in Estoril (POR) last week. The focus there was on getting to know the bike and recording the ergometry. The findings from the test were implemented quickly and the modified parts and new components were already available by the time he arrived at the Jerez de la Frontera test. With the two riders, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team tested engine specifications for 2022, as well as chassis modifications. The direct competitive comparison allows the team to determine the work direction in preparation for the next test in the new year. The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team is also at Jerez de la Frontera with its two new riders. After Eugene Laverty (IRL) and Loris Baz (FRA) visited the team headquarters in Germany in November, they began the test work together at the racetrack. Laverty, who was heavily involved in the development of the BMW M 1000 RR, will be racing with the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in his third season as a BMW works driver. Baz is already familiar with the BMW S 1000 RR, on which he rode in the WorldSBK in 2018, and uses the test to learn more about the M RR. Quotes after the Jerez de la Frontera test. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “There have been a lot of new things at this test. In general, it has been important to test with all four riders, including the two new additions Baz and Redding, before Christmas. It was good to have all four riders on the same bike on the same race track. We brought a lot of new test items that we either confirmed or evaluated with all four of the in order to get the right direction. With two new riders you of course first to get used to the way they give their feedback and how to transfer their comments but we managed that very well. We then also compared this feedback with that given by van der Mark and Laverty who already knew the bike very well. We have ticked all boxes in our test programme but maybe might do some further laps tomorrow. We gathered a huge amount of information and this is now to be analysed. Overall, we found very good directions and in general, I am very satisfied. We take a lot of positives back home. Now we will have a well-deserved Christmas break but then we will continue to intensively prepare for the season. We are very optimistic looking forward.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a successful test for both sides of the pit box. We have a new rider with Scott. He had a lot of things to work through but most importantly for him was to find that comfortable setting feeling with the bike. I am really pleased about his work ethic in the pit box. He has put a lot of laps in and he acclimatised very well. On Michael’s side, we worked on similar development parts to what Scott has and he has been working through that very well as well. Comparing both riders’ feedback it is very similar and I am very pleased about that. I think it is proving that the set-up direction we are going with the BMW M 1000 RR is aligned between both riders which is very important. Equally important is that we got new team-members within the group and I am really pleased to see how all these guys are working together. There has been a lot of overlapping, a lot of chassis changes, a lot of engine changes and everybody has been working as a group, so I applaud all the team and all the guys working very closely together. Overall I think we can leave the test here at Jerez with our heads held up high, we have done a good job and we can go into the Christmas break with a lot of confidence and get ready for our next test in the new year.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was good to have a test even if it was so late in the year. We had a lot of new components and items to try on the bike. At this test we barely played around with the set-up of the bike, we mainly tried new parts to figure out what brings improvement and what does not. We need to get some ideas and start producing the new things. It has been a really good test and I am really happy with a lot of new things. It was great to gather good information and now I am looking forward to a short Christmas break.” Michael Galinski, Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “It has been the first test for the new season and the first time for us to be at the race track with the big team. I want to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to Jürgen Röder, who made it possible for us to now compete as a two-rider team. He will attend many races next year and we are looking forward to that. We have a lot of new people with us, also the riders are partly new for us. Of course we have known both for many years. Loris has already raced for our team and I have also known Eugene for quite some time. Both did a great job at the test. But not only that, it was also important for me to gel with the new members as a team and to get used to each other. That worked very well. With new people, for example from England and France, our team has become more international after being a more or less German squad in the past. Like at every other team, English is now our team language. The collaboration in the combination with SMR and Bonovo action also works very well. There are always a lot of things to try and when time allows we share this between us. The test has been very positive in all aspects, we are also happy with the lap times. But we still have some things to find and work to do.” Eugene Laverty, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I already met the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in November when we went to Germany and spent a weekend together with the guys. They invited us all there and it was so nice to meet each other away from the track because sometimes you only meet the guys in a work environment. So to go there, have some beers and relax away from the track and made me feel at home straight away. The first test days with the team have been very positive. I felt comfortable on the bike immediately after the first couple of exits on day one. I feel good in braking which is an area I am always working on. I am happy with the progress we are making. There is still work to do to improve our turning in the long corners compared to the other BMW riders but I am happy that we are right there in the mix. There is a really good atmosphere in the box, I get on very well with Loris. He is a fast guy and that’s important, to have a fast team-mate to push you. We work together well and all the guys are experienced as well. It’s great crew and I think we have a good year ahead of us.” Loris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I am happy to be back with BMW and about the opportunity to be back in WorldSBK. I was really looking forward to that test to have a first impression. A December test is never the most crucial one of the season but it’s really important for getting to know the team, to meet the people and for the feeling you are going into the winter with. The test was a lot of work, we did a lot of laps. Also, I was back on the bike after nearly three months and it is never easy when you jump on a bike that is completely different. The test was about understanding how the bike works and also to try to give the best input based on the differences of all the bikes I know. I have riden a lot of bikes in WorldSBK so I was trying to adapt to the bike and at the same time give the right input on what we can improve on that bike. The M RR has a lot of strong points, we just need to put them together to get a bike that works well from a riding side. When you start working with a new bike, you have to switch from one riding style to another but we did a good job, completing over 150 laps. Yes, I am happy. We tried some new parts for next year and mainly a lot of things on the electronics, and with every run we went faster and I felt a bit more confident on the bike. I am satisfied with the job so far.” \n"}

Since 2014, BMW Motorrad Motorsport has brought private BMW racers from different international and national championships around the world under one roof in a unique competition – the Race Trophy. In 2021, a new scoring system was introduced with the ‘winning percentage’. The Race Trophy points correspond to the percentage of the points that the competitors have scored in their respective championship in relation to the maximum number of points possible in the racing series. Young emerged triumphant from a close battle to win the 2021 Race Trophy. He finished on the podium in all seven races of the 2021 CSBK season – one victory, five second-places and one third – and scored a total of 84.86 Race Trophy points. In doing so, Young narrowly defeated Roberto Tamburini (ITA) from the Italian National Trophy 1000, who ended the year on 84.00 points. Third place went to Alexandre Leleu (FRA) from the French European Bikes Championship with 76.86 points. “Congratulations to Ben Young, on behalf of the entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport family,” said BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “It has been another very exciting season, in which our private racers around the world have again achieved countless successes. As such, the ‘winning percentages’ they achieved in their respective racing series are very high. All the top riders won races and claimed podiums in their championships on the BMW M 1000 RR and the BMW S 1000 RR, so the race for the Race Trophy was a very close one. We are also very proud to have a number of champions in our ranks again this season. I would like to congratulate all our motor racing customers on the success they have achieved this season. They are the best ambassadors we at BMW Motorrad Motorsport could wish for.” “Congratulations to Ben Young and all the participants on their success in the 2021 season,” said Uwe Geyer, who is responsible for the Race Trophy at BMW Motorrad Motorsport. “We are delighted that private BMW racers remain keen to be a part of the Race Trophy family – although the pandemic continues to affect the sport of motor racing.

We are grateful to all the racers and teams for being part of the BMW Motorrad Racing community.” A BMW M 1000 RR for winner Ben Young.Unfortunately, the pandemic meant it was not possible to stage a grand finale to assemble and honour the top riders in 2021. Instead, Young received his main prize – the BMW M 1000 RR – at BMW Motorrad Canada. “Achieving this is very important to myself and my team,” said winner Young. “After a Covid affected 2020 it is very satisfying to come back racing and reach these goals I set for myself. I feel like this is a great opportunity for myself and Canadian racing to be recognized on a worldwide stage, and I am proud to be able to do that. It was a great season of racing. It was nice to be back after a year out. Working for the first time with the new generation BMW S 1000 RR was amazing right from the get go, gaining knowledge every lap we turned along the way. We do plan on racing the BMW M 1000 RR next year which for me is like a dream come true. Ever since the bike was released, it was something to drool over and now being able to race it is going to be spectacular!” Victories and podiums aplenty.Second-placed Tamburini ended the year just 0.86 points behind Young. Tamburini also finished on the podium in all seven races in the Italian National Trophy 1000. With three victories, two second-places and a third, he was crowned champion with races to spare. This was the first title for the new BMW M 1000 RR. Third-placed Leleu was the man to beat in the French European Bikes Championship. In 14 races, he took eight victories on the BMW S 1000 RR, as well as one runner-up finish and two third-places. He also won the title in his series. Tamburini and Leleu, like all the riders who finished from second to tenth place, receive vouchers for BMW Motorrad parts packages, which can be redeemed at BMW Motorrad Motorsport Official Partner, alpha Racing.

{"prompt":"The series development process for the world's only purely electrically powered luxury sedan is entering its final phase as it being tested on gruelling test tracks around the world,  Electric motors, all-wheel drive and high-voltage battery must prove how reliable and high-performing they are under maximum load. ->","completion":" Munich. The series development process of the BMW i7 in entering its final phase with the car undergoing a demanding test programme in extreme road and weather conditions. During so-called hot-region testing on tracks and public roads all over the world, the development engineers primarily verify the performance and reliability of the electric motors, the all-wheel drive and the high-voltage battery when being exposed to maximum stress from high temperatures, unpaved roads, dust and large differences in altitude. The road to series production takes the prototypes of the BMW i7 over gravel tracks into deserts, into the mountains and on a whole series of highly dynamic routes. The BMW i7, the world's only purely electrically powered luxury sedan, will be presented in the course of 2022 together with other model variants of the new BMW 7 Series.The endurance test in the hot regions of various countries and continents serves in particular to test and safeguard all components of the electric drive system. The components of the fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology developed for the BMW i7 demonstrate their unrestricted functionality even under the most adverse conditions when being used continuously in extremely high outside temperatures, permanent sunlight and dry conditions.Within a firmly defined test programme for the prototypes, loads are simulated that correspond to the challenges faced by a series-production vehicle during a complete product life cycle. Supported by sensitive on-board measurement technology, experienced test engineers register every reaction of the electric motors, the high-voltage battery, drive control and the integrated cooling system as well as the charging technology and energy management to weather and road-related influences.The testing programme, which covers tens of thousands of kilometres, includes long-distance and high-speed driving as well as stop-and-go traffic in scorching heat. In addition, test sections with particularly large differences in altitude were selected at the hot-region test sites. In this way the temperature behaviour of the electric motors and the torque control of the all-electric BMW xDrive can be analysed during a particularly dynamic and long-lasting uphill drive. To further increase the load on the drive system, the test programme also includes mountain driving in trailer mode. At the same time, the high-voltage battery shows how it able to continuously deliver peak power to supply the e-motors. As an extreme scenario and a particular challenge for energy management and power electronics, the test also involves driving downhill with a high-voltage storage system that is already fully charged at the start and can therefore no longer absorb any recuperation energy.The gruelling hot-region test procedure is also used to put the performance of the air-conditioning and other on-board electronics, as well as the temperature resistance of the materials used in the interior, to a particularly tough test. This is all to ensure that the world's only purely electrically powered luxury sedan delivers a perfectly harmonised and exclusive driving experience in any situation.\n"}

More than a year before it will be delivered to BMW M Motorsport teams, the new BMW M4 GT4 completed its first tests last week in Almeria (ESP). Development of the car is already at an advanced stage. The goal is to continue the impressive success story of its predecessor. To enable this, the new BMW M4 GT4 will not only feature the strengths of the current car, there will be improvements in some areas. As well as performance, BMW M Motorsport engineers are also placing great importance on ease of maintenance and cost efficiency. The BMW M production model provides an outstanding basis, while the new car will also adopt certain components from its big brother, the BMW M4 GT3. “With the new BMW M4 GT4, we are writing the next chapter in a major success story,” said Thomas Felbermair, Vice President Sales and Marketing BMW M GmbH. “The current model has shaken up the booming GT4 class in recent years, and has celebrated many titles and victories all over the world. When developing the new BMW M4 GT4, we wanted to retain the strengths of its predecessor and even improve them in some areas. We are confident that BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers will have a huge amount of fun with this model. The hunt for more trophies in the GT4 segment starts in 2023.” Development of the GT4 model, which is based on the new BMW M4 production car , began with initial computer simulations in September 2020. The BMW M4 GT4 has been developed since the start of 2021 and the first test vehicle assembled since the summer. The chassis, including an FIA-approved safety cage, comes from the BMW Group Plant in Dingolfing (GER), where the production car is also built. The BMW M4 GT4 completed its first functional test in October 2021. As a car designed to be used by private BMW M Motorsport teams, the focus is on such issues as ease of maintenance and operational costs. Just like its predecessor, the BMW M4 GT4 is setting new benchmarks in this regard. The complete drivetrain, including engine, transmission and electronics, has been adopted from the production model. This outstanding basis, which includes a multi-level traction control, has been optimised in detail for use in motorsport. The developers placed particular emphasis on cooling, which is always a major challenge in the GT4 class. Some components, like the CFC roof and rear wing concept, have been adopted from the BMW M4 GT3. The use of sustainable materials like natural fibres, which replace carbon and plastic components, plays an important role. BMW M Motorsport is cooperating with the company Bcomp in this area. Further strong partners supporting the BMW M4 GT4 project are H&R, Ravenol and RECARO. “Although we are still in a very early phase of testing, there are already areas, in which we have achieved progress compared to the current BMW M4 GT4,” said BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER), who took on the test work alongside Erik Johansson (SWE) in Almeria. “This applies in particular to the seat ergonomics, ease of operation and many additional functions that the predecessor did not have. As far as driveability is concerned, the new BMW M4 GT4 feels very secure from the word go. It has a large top range, in which you can push the car to the limit. We still have a full year to optimise the car to be used by private teams and drivers, but it is already a lot of fun to drive.” The test work continues over the coming months. A second test car will be available for this purpose at the start of 2022.\n"}

BMW M Motorsport and the BMW Junior Team ended two eventful weeks in North America with the 24 Hours of Sebring (USA). Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) started with a visit to BMW Team RLL at Petit Le Mans, Road Atlanta (USA). This was followed by a tour of the BMW Group plant in Spartanburg (USA), a trip to see Verhagen’s family at their home, and then the test race with the new BMW M4 GT3 at Sebring International Raceway, where Hesse and Verhagen competed alongside US drivers Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley and James Clay. The race in the Creventic 24H Series served as the final test for the new car at one of the toughest circuits in the world. BMW M Motorsport also used the weekend to hand over the new BMW M4 GT3 from the test crew at BMW Team RMG to the North American teams. BMW Junior Team on tour.For Harper, Hesse and Verhagen, the USA trip began at the season finale of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, where they accompanied the BMW works drivers and BMW Team RLL all weekend, attended important meetings, and experienced the processes in a BMW M Motorsports works programme at first hand. “We learned an awful lot in the collaboration with BMW Team RLL and the BMW works drivers,” said Hesse. “Plus, it was nice to be involved in the farewell race for the BMW M8 GTE and sample the atmosphere at Road Atlanta.” This was followed by a trip to the largest BMW Group plant in the world, in Spartanburg, where the BMW Junior Team gained first-hand insights into the production of BMW X models. “As we are representing BMW as drivers, it was cool for us to see how production works in the largest plant in the world in Spartanburg,” said Verhagen. “It is huge, and we only saw a small part of it. Hopefully, we will return sometime and check out some other areas. It was really fascinating.” Harper, Hesse and Verhagen, together with their mentor Jochen Neerpasch, who accompanied the BMW Junior Team throughout the entire trip, then visited the BMW Car Club of America Foundation, which possesses a fascinating exhibition of vintage BMW vehicles and other BMW collectibles. A special wall drawing was dedicated to the motorsport history of Jochen Neerpasch. The group saw out the evening with a barbecue with Verhagen’s family, who live in Mooresville (USA) near Spartanburg. For Neerpasch and the Juniors, the trip to the USA marked the end of two years together. “So far, the guys have exceeded the expectations we had of them at the start, which were pretty high anyway,” said Neerpasch. “All that they are missing is experience. They are already setting lap times like those of the top drivers. They need more race outings, and they are sure to get them next season.” Harper was also positive in his appraisal of his time as a BMW Junior so far: “We have come a long way since the first NLS race almost two years ago. It is incredible how much we have learned in that time – both as racing drivers and as people. Our training is hard, but it is paying dividends. I think our results in the BMW M6 GT3 this season have proved that.” BMW M4 GT3 test outing under race conditions at Sebring.Last weekend was all about the BMW M4 GT3 – not only for the BMW Junior Team, but also for BMW M Motorsport. The 24 Hours of Sebring was the final endurance test for the car, before it goes in search of victories and titles from January 2022. When it does so, it will be in the hands of private BMW M Motorsport teams, some of which are based in North America. For this reason, BMW M Motorsport took the opportunity at Sebring to hand over the BMW M4 GT3 from the test crew, BMW Team RMG, to the US teams, who will run the car in the coming season. Engineers and mechanics from BMW Teams RMG and RLL worked together for the outing at Sebring. The Turner Motorsport and BimmerWorld Racing teams were also involved with drivers Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley and James Clay and gained valuable experience with the new car. The joint learning began with tests during the week and peaked with the 24-hour race at one of the toughest circuits in the world, with countless bumps that really put the car through its paces. After two repairs, following collisions, and some minor issues during the race, the BMW M4 GT3 crossed the finish line after 457 laps. Hesse and Verhagen were the two Juniors who took part in the race. Harper was only involved in the tests, as he is classed as a Gold driver, of which only one may be registered per team. The Gold driver for this race was Auberlen. “The circuit is different to the ones we are familiar with in Europe,” said Hesse, summing up the test under race conditions. “Unfortunately, there were two incidents in the race, which resulted in long repairs. Apart from that, the BMW M4 GT3 did very well. Racing here was a valuable experience.” The American drivers drew a very positive conclusion. “The first impression of the BMW M4 GT3 is that it looks fantastic,” said Auberlen. “Then I drove it, and I can say that it is far better in every area than the BMW M6 GT3. With a 24-hour race in Sebring, we put the BMW M4 GT3 to the toughest test imaginable.” Foley said: “A fantastic car. You can immediately feel the two years of development that have been invested in the BMW M4 GT3. The systems in the interior, with which the driver works, are a big step forward compared to the BMW M6 GT3. The car is very user-friendly.” This was backed up by Clay, who was driving a GT3 race car for the first time in Sebring: “Given that the BMW M4 GT3 is far faster than the GT4 cars I have driven previously, I found it very easy to adapt to the car, as the car is very well thought out and easy to operate. I was able to focus fully on the driving.” The BMW M4 GT3 will contest its first race in the hands of BMW M Motorsport teams in January 2022, at the 24 Hours of Dubai (UAE). This will be followed by the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) at the end of the month. The detailed race programme for the BMW Junior Team will be announced at a later date. \n"}

BMW, the Western Golf Association (WGA) and the PGA TOUR today signed a five-year extension of their long and successful partnership. BMW will remain title sponsor of the BMW Championship, which has been named PGA TOUR Tournament of the Year on four occasions since it was first held in 2007, until 2027. The BMW Championship will continue as the penultimate tournament in the PGA TOUR’s FedExCup Playoffs, featuring 70 of the world’s best players competing for the 30 places at the season-ending TOUR Championship. Before BMW came on board as title sponsor, the tournament was known as the Western Open and was first held in 1899, making it one of the longest-running events on the PGA TOUR.“For the past 15 years, we have worked with our partners at the PGA TOUR and the Western Golf Association to host the top 70 players in the world at what has become one of the best, and most exciting events on the golf calendar,” said Sebastian Mackensen, president and CEO, BMW of North America. “The BMW Championship is not only a great way to showcase our brand and engage customers, but also a wonderful opportunity to raise money for the Evans Scholars Foundation and help so many young students to follow their dreams.”Each year, proceeds from the BMW Championship benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation, which provides full tuition and housing scholarships for hard-working young caddies. Over the past 15 years, the BMW Championship has raised more than $40 million on behalf of the Evans Scholars Foundation and has helped send more than 3,000 students to college. This academic year, a record 1,070 caddies are attending 21 major colleges and universities on Evans Scholarships.“Since 2007, BMW has been our valued partner and a steadfast supporter of both our championships and the Evans Scholars Foundation,” said John Kaczkowski, WGA president and CEO. “As title sponsor, BMW has fully embraced our mission, helping us transform the Evans Scholars Foundation into a truly national program. We’re excited and grateful for the opportunity to continue working together to change the lives of youth caddies nationwide.”PGA TOUR commissioner Jay Monahan added: “We would like to express our sincere thanks to BMW for their continued support of the PGA TOUR and the Western Golf Association through 2027. The BMW Championship played an incredibly impactful role in launching the FedExCup in 2007 and BMW’s commitment to presenting a best-in-class event each year continues to elevate the FedExCup Playoffs.”By extending its role as the title sponsor of the BMW Championship, BMW also strengthens its worldwide commitment to the sport of golf. This year, the company was Worldwide Partner of the Ryder Cup for the first time, and BMW will continue in this role when Marco Simone Golf & Country Club (Rome, Italy) hosts the Ryder Cup in 2023. The premium automobile manufacturer will also continue to organise the BMW International Open in Munich (Germany), and remains title sponsor of the BMW PGA Championship in London (England) and the BMW Ladies Championship in Busan (South Korea).\n"}

The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team will be breaking new ground in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) once again at the 2021 season finale. The final races of the year will be held at the new Mandalika International Street Circuit on the Indonesian island of Lombok, a popular holiday destination. The team will field their regular line-up of Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) once again at the finale. Sykes returns from injury to resume his place in the saddle of the BMW M 1000 RR. The Superbike World Championship has been held in Indonesia previously between 1994 and 1997. The Sentul International Circuit was the venue in those days. The Mandalika International Street Circuit is a street circuit in the Mandalika resort area of the Lombok island; it is 4.310-kilometres long, with 17 turns. When no races are being held, the track is used as a public road. The paddock and the stands are only set up temporarily for race events. Quotes ahead of the Mandalika races. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We’re really looking forward to the races in Indonesia and to lining up on the brand-new Mandalika International Street Circuit. It’s a little bit unusual to be racing at a track where the characteristics are totally unknown but we’re not alone; the whole paddock is in the same position. What we do know is how enthusiastic the fans in Indonesia are and how passionate they are about motorcycles and our sport so we’re guaranteed a great atmosphere for the final. We’re delighted that Tom is back and will do our best to ensure he has a successful final race weekend with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. We’re aiming to finish the 2021 season with more strong results for Tom and Mickey.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We are pleased to be here in Indonesia and looking forward to see the Mandalika circuit. From everything we have seen from the drone shots and photographs, it looks like an exciting international circuit with a lot of variety and we are looking forward to that. It is brand new for everybody, obviously. Also, we welcome Tom back to the team. It’s a pretty long time since he got injured in Catalunya so we are delighted that Tom can come back and finish the season with the team. The weather forecast, typically in this part of the world, is very changeable. It’s very hot and humid but with a very high chance of rain every day. So we will prepare for every eventuality. Overall, we are looking forward to the season finale and hope we can make it great final races of the season.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I’m very much looking forward to getting back on my BMW M 1000 RR. It has been a long time since I last raced and obviously we have a little bit of work to do to catch up. But having said that, I have to say that the excitement of going to a totally new venue is quite something, not only because Indonesia is a great part of the world. Everybody looks to be doing an incredible job on the new circuit of Mandalika. What a unique venue – to say the least. On top of that, it is located on a beautiful island so I am really looking forward to it. It is new for everybody and I have to say that it is going to be a little bit of a way to finish the season, but that’s another story. In general, it’s a great place to finish the season, and hopefully we can finish it with some strong results to end 2021.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It’s fantastic to go to Indonesia. It’s nice to have a new circuit on the calendar, especially in Asia. I love to go there. It’s also incredible that it’s the last round of the season already. I cannot wait to try the Mandalika circuit because it looks really nice from what I have seen. Getting to know a new track is not too difficult; it comes with doing the laps. I think that it will be a great season finale. We had some strong weekends this year and obviously that’s the same way we want to finish the season.” \n"}

After two Rolex 24 victories in Daytona (USA) and five IMSA series class wins, the farewell race of the MOTUL BMW M8 GTE added the 26th podium finish and a pole position to the history books. At Petit Le Mans, the final race of the season in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Road Atlanta (USA), Jesse Krohn (FIN) put the #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE on pole position in class and led the field into the last race of the GTLM era. The race proved to be tougher than qualifying but shortly before the end of the ten hours, Krohn and his BMW Team RLL colleagues John Edwards (USA) and Augusto Farfus (BRA) took over P3 and could step on the GTLM podium one final time. The #25 sister car and the Turner Motorsport BMW M6 GT3 had to retire due to race incidents. On a special weekend for BMW M Motorsport, BMW of North America and the IMSA series, the MOTUL BMW M8 GTE took its final bow from racing as a pole-sitter and podium finisher. After a dominant performance by Krohn in qualifying on Friday that was awarded with pole position in GTLM class, both cars struggled to match their oppenents’ pace in the last ever GTLM contest. BMW Team RLL kept fighting until the end and was awarded with a late promotion to P3 in the race. Farfus had the honour of finishing the last stint of the last race for the BMW M8 GTE. The #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE made good progress from the P6 starting position on the GTLM grid. Unfortunately, the car had to be retired following an incident involving Connor De Phillippi (USA), leaving him and his fellow drivers Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT) disappointed. After the farewell of the BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL now sets sights towards its future in GTD Pro with the BMW M4 GT3 in 2022 and in the LMDh class with the BMW M LMDh in 2023. Turner Motorsport had a disappointing final weekend of the IMSA season with DNFs with the BMW M6 GT3 in GTD class as well as with both BMW M4 GT4s in Friday’s IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge season finale. Special guests of BMW of North America at Petit Le Mans were Jochen Neerpasch, founder of BMW Motorsport GmbH in 1972, and the current BMW Junior Team drivers Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA). Quotes after the MOTUL Petit Le Mans: Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “What a day! Bidding farewell to the GTLM class, the BMW M8 GTE, the BMW M6 GT3, added by a showrun with the BMW M4 GT3. Before that we confirmed BMW Team RLL as our partner for the coming years in North America and published first pictures as well as a name for our future BMW M LMDh project. Thanks to everybody who put a lot of effort in the BMW M8 GTE. Podium and pole position in the final race are a nice conclusion. Now we open a new chapter and look forward to the BMW M4 GT3, that will do a test race next week in Sebring.” John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd place): “It was a bit of a surprising podium at the end but it is really nice to sign off the BMW M8 GTE with a successful weekend – qualifying on pole and finishing on the podium. We desparately wanted to win that one after last year’s heart break when we were leading in the last hour before being pushed off the track. But it is a positive end to the era of the M8. Now we are looking forward to the BMW M4 GT3 and hopefully we can celebrate of the same success with that car.” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd place): “Obviously, we wanted to finish the season and the BMW M8 GTE programme with a win but today it just wasn’t in the cards. We did all that we could but the Porsches were just too fast and the Corvettes as well so this was basically the maximum result that we could achieve. I am super happy for the team that we got this. Obviously we wanted to win but that didn’t happen today.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd place): “I was pleased to do the final stint in the M8 GTE. I think we have to be proud of ourselves, we did what we could. It was the maximum we could achieve. We brought to the end the result that was possible today. We close a chapter but it is a long book. The BMW M4 GT3 is just around the corner and we can’t wait to be back.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, DNF): “A tough race today. We were a bit out of strategy trying to make up for some of the deficit we had in the pits. We were pushing as hard as we could. Before the incident there were a few prototypes behind me. I thought, one of them would be right behind me, but he went into the pits. I left a bit too much space in the last corner, got on the marbles and went off. I was just a passenger at that point. Of course it’s very disappointing to end the M8 program for our car on that note. I feel bad for the guys.”\n"}

The fastest qualifier of the 2021 MotoGP™ season is once again Fabio Quartararo. The Frenchman, who wrapped up the world championship title with races to spare in October, won this year’s coveted BMW M Award, for the second season in a row. The award is an integral component of BMW M’s activities as ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’ and was presented for the 19th time in 2021. The prize for the winner is traditionally a high-performance car from BMW M – this year the new BMW M5 * in Brands Hatch Grey Metallic. The prize car was presented at the final race weekend of the season at Valencia by Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, and Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports. Having won the BMW M Award for the first time in 2020, Quartararo was unbeatable again in this special competition. The Frenchman secured pole position five times this season on his way to winning his first MotoGP™ World Championship title. In total, he amassed 318 points for the BMW M Award standings and ended the season 15 points clear of his closest rival. Quartararo received his new BMW M5 CS after the final qualifying of the season on Saturday. The formal handover by Franciscus van Meel and Carmelo Ezpeleta took place in the MotoGP™ VIP Village at Valencia’s ‘Circuit Ricardo Tormo’. “The BMW M Award is of great significance to us. MotoGP is the pinnacle of motorcycle racing and it is very important for us to recognise the outstanding performances of the MotoGP riders over the course of the season,” said van Meel. “Every race weekend, they thrill us with breath-taking performances on the track. MotoGP brings together the best motorcycle racers in the world – and the BMW M Award is the fitting reward for the fastest of them all. For the second time in a row, that person is Fabio Quartararo. He has once again shown his skill and speed this season, deservedly winning the world championship, and has also been in a class of his own again in the BMW M Award. We are delighted to present him with the BMW M5 CS in recognition of his qualifying performances. Congratulations, Fabio – on the world championship title and winning the BMW M Award again. Our 23rd season as ‘Official Car of MotoGP’ draws to a close here at Valencia, and we are now looking forward to 2022. It will be a special year for us at BMW M, as we will be celebrating our 50th birthday – and plans are already being made for an anniversary highlight in MotoGP.” “The BMW M Award has been an important part of MotoGP since 2003, and the presentation ceremony on the Saturday afternoon of the season finale is a nice tradition,” said Ezpeleta. “BMW M GmbH comes up with something special every year when selecting the prize car. This shows how much they value the performances of our riders, and how important the partnership is with MotoGP. This was already the 23rd season together in this long-term and close collaboration. In the BMW M5 CS, BMW M GmbH has again provided a fantastic prize car. Congratulations to our new world champion Fabio Quartararo on his second BMW M Award in a row. He has once again thrilled us with his outstanding performances this year. I am sure he will have a lot of fun with the BMW M5 CS.” “It has been a fantastic season for me, winning my first MotoGP World Championship, and my second BMW M Award is the icing on the cake at the end of this special year,” said winner Quartararo. “I am delighted to have won the BMW M Award again in 2021, having claimed my ‘maiden victory’ last year. I really enjoy driving the BMW M2 CS from the 2020 BMW M Award, and I have to say that the new BMW M5 CS obviously caught my eye as soon as it was presented as this year’s prize car. Even from the outside, you can see how much power and performance it has. It is fantastic that I have actually won it and can take it home with me. Thank you very much to BMW M GmbH, who have been involved in MotoGP for so many years, and who highlight and recognise our performances as riders with the BMW M Award.” The BMW M5 CS is the new top-of-the-range, high-performance model from BMW M and, with its 4.4-litre V8 engine generating 467 kW\/635 hp, is the most powerful car in the company’s history. The new BMW M5 CS sprints from 0 to 100 km\/h in just 3.0 seconds, and from 0 to 200 km\/h in 10.3 seconds. The top speed is an electrically governed 305 km\/h. The high-performance engine teams up with an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission with Drivelogic and uses the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system, which also offers a 2WD mode for pure rear-wheel drive, to channel its power to the road. With the BMW M5 CS, BMW M GmbH has focussed on consistently lightweight design, with many components made from carbon-reinforced plastic (CFRP). Examples of this include the bonnet, front splitter, exterior mirror caps, rear spoiler, rear diffuser, M Power engine compartment cover and intake silencer. The chassis has also been adapted to the weight of the car, which is lighter than other M5 models, with retuned bearing springs at the front and rear axle, and further refined damper control. Many details of the new BMW M5 CS are a tribute to the close association between BMW M GmbH and motorsport. The BMW M Award is an important pillar in BMW M GmbH’s involvement as ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’. Since 2013, the fastest qualifier in MotoGP™ has been recognised at the end of each season with an exclusive high-performance car. The riders score points at each Grand Prix weekend, based on their results in qualifying and using the same points system as in the races themselves. The record winner of the BMW M Award is Marc Márquez, who won the award seven times in a row. Valentino Rossi and Casey Stoner both have three victories in the BMW M Award to their name. Fabio Quartararo and Jorge Lorenzo have both been honoured as the top qualifier on two occasions, while Sete Gibernau and Nicky Hayden have received the award once. For more information about BMW M GmbH and the involvement as the ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’, see: www.bmw-m.com\n"}

BMW Team RLL, who have been celebrating successes with BMW M Motorsport since 2009, will compete in the two LMDh prototypes as of 2023. Initial sketches give a foretaste of the car, which will be called BMW M LMDh. Alongside the LMDh test programme, BMW Team RLL will field two BMW M4 GT3s in the new GTD Pro category in the 2022 IMSA season. “I’m delighted that our LMDh project has reached its next milestone with the announcement of BMW Team RLL as the team to race in the two prototypes,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “As with chassis partner Dallara, in team principal Bobby Rahal and his crew we have outstanding expertise and decades of experience at the highest level on our side. The LMDh project continues to gain momentum and I am confident that next year we will once again take all necessary steps as planned to be as well prepared as possible for entering our first IMSA season with the LMDh prototypes in 2023. We are taking on this new challenge together at full speed.” Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport, added: “BMW Team RLL is the ideal partner for our LMDh project. BMW M Motorsport has been working very successfully with Bobby Rahal and his crew since 2009. During this time, we have all come to know the IMSA series very well and have celebrated major success together. From our perspective, racing in the top class and challenging for overall victories from 2023 is the logical next step. When you compete with a new race car, it is a great advantage to already know what awaits you in the race series, at the circuits, and in terms of organisation. This is 100 percent the case in the constellation we have opted for. That also goes for BMW of North America. Thank you very much for your fantastic support. Plus, BMW Team RLL is not only one of the best teams in North America on the GT scene, but also in Formula racing so we have all the right ingredients for success.” BMW Team RLL has been contesting the GT category of the IMSA and its predecessor series in BMW racing cars since 2009. This partnership’s biggest successes have been the GTLM wins with the BMW M8 GTE at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2019 and 2020, the GTLM title wins in the driver, team and manufacturer standings of the 2020 Michelin Endurance Cup, and a total of five GT titles with the BMW M3 GT in the 2010 and 2011 seasons of the American Le Mans Series. Bobby Rahal’s team also enjoys success in the North American IndyCar Series. The team has won the legendary Indy 500 twice – most recently in 2020. Alongside the intensive testing with the BMW M LMDh, BMW Team RLL will contest the 2022 IMSA season starting with two BMW M4 GT3s in the newly established GTD Pro category in the first races. “For me personally and professionally this is a dream come true”, said Rahal. “Now to first run a brand-new car like the BMW M4 GT3 and after that make the next step with BMW Team RLL to race for overall wins in the LMDh class is a direction we definitely wanted to go. I’m so pleased, so proud, so thankful that we’ll be able to do it together with BMW M Motorsport.” The design sketches of the BMW M LMDh were produced in close collaboration between BMW M Motorsport and BMW Group Designworks. Michael Scully, BMW Group Designworks Global Automotive Director, said: “Uniting the iconic elements of BMW M Motorsport design DNA with the performant architecture of an ultra-modern prototype is what this project is all about. The shape of the BMW M LMDh exemplifies the visceral efficiency which is so synonymous with BMW M Motorsport, yet the design process has been highly collaborative between BMW M Motorsport, Dallara, and BMW Group Designworks. Iterating the exterior surfaces with this team is particularly rewarding because each project partner has distinguished expertise in their discipline, yet there’s a mutual respect and drive to find a transcendent, cohesive result together. I’m confident this car will be something we can all be proud of, and that the on-track results will reflect the development team’s great dynamic. For me personally this project represents the synthesis of my professional design experience and a life-long immersion in prototype racing at lower echelons as a driver. It’s indeed a dream realized.” Note to editors:A new episode of the video series “MBEDDED” will be released on the BMW Motorsport YouTube channel, which will be all about the renewal of the partnership with BMW Team RLL in the context of MOTUL Petit Le Mans.

And the impressive charisma, which is provided by wheel arch trims made of carbon, a roof spoiler with double-wing contour, 18-inch lightweight forged wheels and a model-specific suspension with vehicle lowering, fits perfectly into the image of a city where big appearances play a big role.The most modern top sports car in the model range of the traditional British brand approaches the capital from the south-west, where history and modernity merge in a unique way. And this already begins on the Glienicke Bridge, which has been still a simple wooden bridge 350 years ago. But due to the growing volume of traffic it became part of one of the most important connecting routes between the residential cities of Berlin and Potsdam. Today, the route leads via Königsstraße to the city motorway 115 through Grunewald. This is where the \"Automobile Traffic and Practice Road\" was opened 100 years ago. In its original layout of around 19 kilometres, the AVUS connected today's exhibition grounds near the Charlottenburg district and Nikolassee near Zehlendorf with two straights and a north and a south curve.Race track operations were discontinued in 1998, and the striking administration building on Messedamm and the 200-metre-long spectator grandstand are listed buildings now. Today the MINI John Cooper Works GP brings back a little racing feeling. Its four-cylinder turbo engine accelerates it from a standstill to 100 km\/h in 5.2 seconds. The precisely controllable sports brake system with four-piston fixed calliper disc brakes on the front wheels guarantees equally dynamic deceleration maneuvers. In fast bends, the aerodynamically optimised design features ensure reduced lift, while a top speed of 265 km\/h is possible on long straights. In theory, anyway, because today the speed limit on the AVUS is 100 km\/h.On the Teufelsberg, which is very close to the former Nordkurve, visitors have a great view over the Grunewald and Berlin - no wonder, at 120.1 metres, the Teufelsberg is the second highest elevation in the city. Contemporary spray art can also be admired there. Hundreds of small and large murals have been created on the walls of a former radar station over the past decades.After a brief stop at the Olympic Stadium, the MINI John Cooper Works GP heads for the Mitte district. On Bundesstraße 2, the 67-metre-high Victory Column soon comes into view. The MINI circles the \"Großer Stern\" (Great Star) once (or twice or three times?), as the partially five-lane roundabout is called, and then along the “Straße des 17. Juni” right in front of the Brandenburger Tor. Turn right once, and after just a few hundred metres the two-seater becomes an eye-catcher at Potsdamer Platz. Europe's first traffic lights were located there in 1924. At that time, this intersection was one of the busiest places in the old world. The contrast was all the greatest when Potsdamer Platz became a no-man's land after the Second World War as a place between the American and Soviet occupation zones. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, however, the historic square quickly became a vibrant hotspot again.From modern Potsdamer Platz, the path leads to the Kreuzberg district and there to a historic shopping opportunity. Market Hall 9 on Eisenbahnstraße was opened 130 years ago. There was space for 300 stalls, each four square metres in size, to supply the people with fresh goods. It is one of 14 Berlin market halls that were built in the second half of the 19th century. Today, \"shopping differently\" and \"eating differently\" are now taking part. Traders and customers value seasonal products and regional sources.From Kreuzberg, all it takes is a short hop across the Spree or a brisk ride over the Oberbaum Bridge to reach one of Berlin's most visited tourist spots, the East Side Gallery. It was opened in September 1990 and comprises the longest remaining section of the Berlin Wall. 118 artists from 21 countries created the world's longest open-air gallery on 1.3 kilometres of the former border after the fall of the Wall.If you now follow the Spree, you will arrive at Alexanderplatz and from there via the magnificent boulevard “Unter den Linden”, past the TV Tower, the Berlin Cathedral, the Gendarmenmarkt and the Humboldt Forum in the rebuilt City Palace directly into the government district. History and the present are very close together here between the Reichstag building, the main railway station, the Chancellery and Bellevue Palace, the seat of the Federal President.On the way through Charlottenburg and to the International Congress Centre (ICC), the driver of the MINI John Cooper Works GP has to decide. Either he takes another trip over the AVUS into the Grunewald and over the Glienicke Bridge to Potsdam, or he heads north into the green countryside surrounding Berlin. The choice falls on the excursion to the Mecklenburg Seenland. Because in the middle of the Schorfheide, the MINI John Cooper Works GP can once again demonstrate what it's made of. Europe's largest driving safety centre has existed in Groß Dölln since 2002. The area includes not only a unique handling course, but also a 4.25-kilometre race track.On this terrain, you can experience just how much the developers of the MINI John Cooper Works GP have used their racing know-how to create extreme driving pleasure. A particularly tight engine mount, the rigid body structure, the differential lock integrated into the 8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission and the model-specific high-performance tyres enable a fascinatingly spontaneous development of power when sprinting from a standstill and accelerating out of bends. The no less impressive lateral acceleration results, among other things, from a wide track and model-specific increased camber values for the front and rear wheels. In GP Mode, the intervention thresholds of the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system are also raised. This gives the driver a little more leeway when approaching the limits. GP Mode can be activated quite simply with a toggle switch. And once again there is a certain crackle in the air. \n"}

The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team und BMW Motorrad Motorsport have set the course for the coming season in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). The team will expand its involvement in 2022 and will run two BMW M 1000 RR in the future. In the saddle will be two well-known WorldSBK riders: Eugene Laverty (IRL) and Loris Baz (FRA). 35-year-old BMW works rider Laverty has been racing in WorldSBK since 2011 and enters his third season with BMW Motorrad Motorsport in 2022. Baz also comes with plenty of WorldSBK experience: The 28-year-old Frenchman rode a BMW S 1000 RR in WorldSBK in 2018. Baz made his Superbike World Championship debut in 2012 and started in the series for three years, before switching to MotoGP from 2015 to 2017. He then returned to WorldSBK. In the 2021 season, Baz has been riding in MotoAmerica but has also impressed on a number of outings in WorldSBK. His WorldSBK record to date: two wins and 20 podiums. Baz will now be a BMW works rider in the 2022 season. Jonas Folger (GER), who lined up in WorldSBK with the Bonovo MGM Racing team in 2021, will be looking for a new challenge after what has been a difficult season for him. The cooperation in the WorldSBK has been terminated by mutual consent. Quotes. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: “The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team is an important part of our WorldSBK project and we are really looking forward to intensifying the cooperation. Jürgen Röder’s and Michael Galinski’s team brings a lot of commitment and passion for motor racing to the FIM Superbike World Championship. The fact that this BMW team is now expanding and will line up with two BMW M 1000 RR is an important step for the team and BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s entire WorldSBK project. The team is well-positioned coming into the new season, with two factory bikes and BMW works riders Eugene Laverty and Loris Baz. We are looking forward to tasting success together in the 2022 WorldSBK!” Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The course is set for a successful second season together for BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in the WorldSBK. The team and we have gained a lot of experience in the first year of our cooperation, and that now forms the basis as we continue to move forward together. The two riders starting for the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team also underline our ambition. We are very pleased that Eugene Laverty remains a part of the BMW works rider family and lines up with us in his third season. Although the 2021 season was not always easy for him, he showed a lot of fight and was very committed to our project. At the same time, we are pleased to have Loris Baz on board. Having spent a season on the BMW S 1000 RR in 2018, he is now part of the BMW works rider family. Loris has more than impressed on his WorldSBK outings this season. We are confident that, with their skill and experience, Eugene and Loris will help move the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team forward. We would like to thank Jonas Folger. It is a shame that his debut season in WorldSBK did not play out as we were all hoping. However, he and the team never gave up and always worked hard. We are very grateful to him for that tireless commitment.” Jürgen Röder, Team Owner Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I am overjoyed that we are heading into the next year as a strong BMW Team and that two top riders like Eugene Laverty and Loris Baz will be in the saddle of the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team bikes. The goal is for the two BMW teams to cooperate even more closely. It is great for us to have two strong riders on board. Particularly Eugene, who has been on the BMW for a few years, is an extremely analytical rider, and provides feedback that can be excellently incorporated in the further development of the bike. He knows all the structures at BMW, and who he needs to contact and when, and is obviously a great addition to the team. I think 28-year-old Loris is a great young rider. We have seen what he is capable of. He has done well in MotoAmerica, has returned to World Superbike and has achieved some very impressive results. It is a real godsend for me to have someone like him in our team. I think we have a real chance of consistently finishing in the top ten with both riders next season. That is obviously a real asset for the whole BMW family. At this point, I would like to thank Dr. Markus Schramm and Marc Bongers again for integrating us so closely in the BMW structure. We will do everything we can to live up to this privilege that has been bestowed upon us. At the same time, I would like to thank Jonas Folger for his commitment. He showed great character when came to me and said that he would not be able to add anything to the team in 2022, and that he would not be taking up my option of continuing together in WorldSBK. I find that incredibly impressive. We still have a very good relationship, and that will remain the case.” Michael Galinski, Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “We are pleased to be able to take this step together with Jürgen Röder, and are very proud of our two riders. In Eugene Laverty and Loris Baz we have two excellent riders. Loris has started in many classes, such as MotoGP and Superbikes, on many different manufacturers’ bikes, including BMW and Yamaha. He recently showed what he is capable of at the race in Portugal: two third places as a reserve rider is no mean feat. We are very pleased to have him on board. Eugene has been slightly below par this year, as he was unable to ride for a long time. He is a great development rider and will help us to develop the bike together with BMW. All in all, we are now on equal footing with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. They also have two tall riders on the bike, in Michael van der Mark and Scott Redding. Loris, as the third tall guy, will be able to contribute to the development in this regard. Eugene is not quite as tall, but nevertheless we are all moving in the same direction together. We are looking forward to the coming season!” Eugene Laverty: “I’m very happy to continue with BMW Motorrad and join the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team for the 2022 World Superbike season. It is fantastic to remain in the BMW WorldSBK family. The past six months have been tough for me as a rider and so I’m very grateful for the continued support and belief from everyone involved in this project. I’m very motivated to repay that faith in my abilities and I feel confident that following a solid winter testing campaign we can arrive ready and competitive at round one.” Loris Baz: “I am really happy to be back in WorldSBK so I want to thank BMW and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team for giving me this opportunity. I think that I have shown during these two rounds in Spain and Portugal that I have the pace to fight at the front in this championship. BMW is the brand that grew the most in the second part of the season. I have closely watched how the bike was improving. I have been racing with BMW before so I know a lot of people there and also, I have been competing with MGM Racing for one race back in 2012. I am really happy and really excited about this opportunity and am looking forward to trying the bike and to starting to work together with the team and BMW. Thanks again to all the people involved in this project.” \n"}

At the start of October, BMW Junior Team completed its first season with a GT3 car on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) – and although a DNF in the final race prevented them from taking the title, it was still an extremely successful year for Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA). Two wins and four podiums in the BMW M6 GT3 earned them second place overall in the GT3 class and the NLS Speed Trophy. In November, BMW Junior Team heads to the USA, where they will attend both Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta and the 24 Hours of Sebring. Hesse and Verhagen will even have the opportunity to take part in the Creventic 24H Series race in a BMW M4 GT3. The rapid development of BMW Junior Team, which started in 2020 in the BMW M240i Racing and BMW M4 GT4 in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS), continued seamlessly in 2021 with the BMW M6 GT3, run by BMW Team RMG. Victories in races four and five of the season on the Nordschleife, backed up by one second place and a third place in the second half of the season, are definitive proof that Harper, Hesse and Verhagen have established themselves among the top GT drivers. Within a short time, they have gone from promising, talented youngsters to proven winners. The next step for the BMW Junior Team in 2022 is the BMW M4 GT3. They will set their sights on overall victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours with BMW Motorsport’s new GT3 flagship. The team was given its first taste of the BMW M4 GT3 during tests. Hesse and Verhagen will now have the opportunity to contest their first race in this car in November. The whole BMW Junior Team first travels to Petit Le Mans, the final round of this season’s IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Road Atlanta, from where they head straight to the Creventic 24 Hours of Sebring. Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley and James Clay (all USA) will be at the wheel of a BMW M4 GT3 there. Alongside this trio, there are still two places available for drivers with a Silver racing licence. Hesse and Verhagen fall into this category. As Harper already possesses a Gold licence, he must wait for his first race outing. However, he will be involved in all the workflows at the circuit and will also complete a number of test laps, in order to familiarise himself with both the car and the track. The BMW M8 GTE and BMW M6 GT3 bid farewell at Road Atlanta.BMW Junior Team will witness the farewell appearances of the BMW M8 GTE and BMW M6 GT3 at the IMSA season finale at Road Atlanta. At the wheel of BMW Team RLL’s two BMW M8 GTEs will be John Edwards (USA), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Augusto Farfus (BRA), and Connor De Phillippi (USA), Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT). Turner Motorsport will also run a BMW M6 GT3 in the GTD class. Quotes from the BMW Junior Team on the 2021 season: Jochen Neerpasch, mentor to the BMW Junior Team:“BMW Junior Team has developed rapidly. From the BMW M240i Racing and the BMW M4 GT4 to the BMW M6 GT3, they have only ever needed a few races to achieve success. In my opinion, that can be traced back to our team building. As a team, they learn a huge amount from each other and thus develop faster than other racing drivers who are on their own. I am sure that the three of them are now capable of winning the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring.” Stefan Reinhold, team principal BMW Team RMG:“For us as a team from the Eifel region, it was obviously fantastic to finally go racing and taste success on the Nordschleife. In this regard, the season has been great. We saw at the 24-hour race that our young drivers can mix it with the best. After that, they have consistently been among the front-runners, and we have claimed our first victories. That makes us both happy and proud.” Dan Harper on the NLS season:“Fortunately, we have had more highs than lows this season. We could never have dreamed that we would still be in contention to win a title in the final race so we can take a lot of positives from the year. Our learning curve has been very steep and we have gained valuable experience, as drivers and a team. That will definitely make us stronger in the future.” Max Hesse on the NLS season:“We gained an awful lot of experience in the NLS season and have developed massively as racing drivers and a team. Second place in the Speed Trophy is a good result, even if it is obviously a shame that we lost the title due to a crash in the final race.” Max Hesse on his start in Sebring:“The start at Sebring is a superb opportunity for us. Personally, I have never raced in the USA, so to do that in the new BMW M4 GT3 and at such an iconic circuit is mega. Hopefully the weather will play ball and we will have our first full 24-hour race, after the race at the Nürburgring was cut short.” Neil Verhagen on the NLS season:“I think we can be very proud of what we achieved this season, despite the unfortunate way it ended. A huge thank you goes to BMW Team RMG for the fantastic work and support. We have all proved that we are not only young trainees driving anywhere, but that we belong among the best. It was not easy to learn everything in our first year in a GT3 race car, but Dan, Max and I helped each other a lot. We worked perfectly as the BMW Junior Team.” Neil Verhagen on his start in Sebring:“I cannot describe how excited I am about racing in my home country in the BMW M4 GT3. I have dreamed of racing in the USA again for years. My parents will be at Sebring to watch me drive the new BMW M4 GT3. That is going to be a very special experience for me.” \n"}

From where we started on Friday to where we finished today has been fantastic hard work from him and his crew and a testament to the steps that we have taken. We never quite got the chance for the podium today but a fifth and two sixth-places in the three races is a great reward for the hard work. To finish eight seconds behind the winner and just a couple of seconds off the podium in today’s main race just shows how much improvement we have made with the bike so it was great work by Mickey and his team. Eugene unfortunately struggled today. In practice, he and Michael rode together and they swapped places to see where Eugene had issues but it seems that we could not transfer that into comfortable settings so Eugene was struggling both in the Superpole race and in the main race. It is a shame for him as he had deserved much better results than these. Thanks to Eugene for stepping in for Tom at the last three rounds. Now we are looking forward to Tom’s return in Indonesia.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a good Sunday. This morning in warm-up, we tried something different with the bike but in the end we weren’t really sure so we went back to yesterday’s set-up. In the Superpole race, I had a good race, I had fun and enjoyed it a lot. I had some good battles and was pretty fast, faster than yesterday. It was nice to start from fifth on the grid for race two. I had an okay start and was in the group fighting for the podium. To be honest, in the beginning I was struggling a bit with the full fuel tank. Towards the end of the race I was alone but I was riding a good pace and it was nice to see what we can do. I think that it has been an overall good weekend. We take some good points home and it was nice to be able to fight with the guys for the podium today in race two but for sure we need to be a little bit faster.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Altogether, from my side, it has been a very tough weekend. I struggled to make progress. We changed the bike to improve my feeling and we never made any major breakthrough. Also in the last race to finish outside the points after giving my everything over the entire race was a bitter pill to swallow so I am disappointed with my performance. All the guys in the team deserved a better result but unfortunately I wasn’t able to deliver it. Thanks for this great opportunity to be in the team for these three rounds.

At the start, van der Mark shortly fell back but soon was back to seventh while Laverty moved up three positions to exit the first turns in ninth. Laverty then moved up to eighth on lap five, right behind van der Mark. The two BMW riders remained in those positions until Laverty fell back to tenth around the halfway point of the race. Van der Mark closed the gap to the top six and claimed sixth spot on lap eleven, and that was the position he was in when taking the chequered flag after 21 laps. Meanwhile, Laverty fought with blunt weapons and crossed the line in 13th position. Quotes after race one at San Juan. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Today has been a much better day than FP1 and FP2 yesterday. Both Michael and Eugene have made big steps forward as we expected from yesterday’s performance. In Superpole, Michael only narrowly missed out the second row and Eugene did great job to get on the fourth row in twelfth position from where he had started the weekend so going into race one, both guys were in a much happier situation. I think the bikes are very alike in set-up which is something that we strive towards. Going into the race, both guys felt very comfortable. Mostly the entire grid selected the same rear tyre, the SCX which proved to be the only tyre suiting for these conditions. Mickey had a solid race. From seventh position he battled to sixth. From there he could not improve position despite the fact that his fastest lap of the race came at the very end. This showed that we have a good basis to work on overnight. In the last five or six laps, Mickey was first or second quickest on track but it just was not possible for him to further improve from sixth position. It was a great effort from him today and clearly fourth to sixth is the target for tomorrow. Eugene just fell back a little bit towards the end of the race. Before, he was in a good position in a good group of riders but as the fuel load went down, the balance of his bike changed and he was not that comfortable anymore. We will work on that for tomorrow. Overall, it was a not too-bad day. Obviously, we are striving for more but generally we can say that race one was successful for both riders and we are looking forward to the Superpole race and race two tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We have made a big step forward this morning in FP3 compared to yesterday. I was happier with the bike. We made a small change during the session and it was alright. Superpole was quite good; starting seventh on the grid was okay. I did not have a great start, but got into a rhythm and passed some guys. It was a long and a bit of a boring race. I had some small battles but had some limitations trying to pass people but in the end I think sixth isn’t that bad. Now we have to find some small improvements on the bike and we will be fine tomorrow.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Superpole went quite well for me. I managed to qualify twelfth and was happy with the lap time that I did with the qualifying tyre. Also the beginning of the race went well. I made a good start and overtook some guys. After a few laps I was up in eighth position. With a full tank of fuel, the bike was feeling very good but unfortunately once the fuel load went down the bike became very difficult for me and I was struggling towards the end so we need to re-balance the bike to make it better for whenever the fuel tank goes empty. That’s the plan for tomorrow and I am confident that it won’t be such a big job and that we will be a little bit stronger towards the end of the races tomorrow.” \n"}

After twenty wonderful years spent supporting photographers and ten years of the BMW Residency, BMW Group France is now reorienting its support for the arts and reinventing its model. While its new program continues to focus on emerging work, experimentation and image-making, the scheme's scope has been broadened to include all visual arts, with a scholarship offered to an artist-curator duo and a budget available for researching and producing works.The human-machine relationship, creativity and innovation, support and commitment are all key BMW Group values. Support is evident in the patron company's close collaboration with the artists. It works with them at each step of the way, respects their vision, enables them to take bold steps, and provides them with the material and financial resources required to complete their project. Commitment is reflected in our belief that involvement in cultural patronage a self-evident step, since it initiates an emotional conversation with our society. Everything makes sense in this light. A people-focused approach is a key element of our vision.The freedom to create is equally vital to artists and BMW as a designer of disruptive innovations for sustainable and responsible mobility.BMW ART MAKERS: a program supporting experimental and visual art to see differently. \"In a world full of uncertainty, BMW ART MAKERS represents an opportunity for emerging talent in the visual arts world. The program encourages artists to take an alternative perspective on the major issues facing the modern world and on key societal challenges. They are given complete freedom to develop this perspective through experimentation and completion of a multi-dimensional visual arts project\", comments Vincent Salimon, CEO of BMW Group France.For 10 years, the BMW Residency, under the remarkable and demanding artistic direction of François Cheval, has accompanied laureates who questioned the new practices linked to the history of photography at the Nicéphore Niépce Museum, and then new techniques and the relationship to the image at GOBELINS.Today, BMW Group France is now seeking to address the profound societal change currently taking place. The BMW ART MAKERS new program supports projects that essentially involve producing images, but also entail exploration of all contemporary image-making dimensions and formats (photography, film, video and computer-generated, virtual, digital images and their presentation to audiences), choosing and researching media, reproduction techniques, and dissemination networks.BMW ART MAKERS: a scholarship and production budget for an artist-curator duo seeking to complete a joint artistic project.Since two brains are better than one, BMW ART MAKERS is seeking to bring together and support an emerging visual artist and a curator through its calls for applications for which the two parties must apply jointly. This partnership draws on the strength of a strong, like-minded duo to generate the trust and competitive spirit required for completing a major project from the initial idea to the end work. The curator is just as important as the artist in terms of implementing an artistic project and ensuring a concrete piece of work results from it.This is the first time that a program of this scale offer a curator support through a visual arts project scholarship alongside an artist. S\/he will perform the role of artistic director, scenographer and designer, ensuring that the project is completed to the artistic standards, time frame and budget specified in the call for applications.BMW ART MAKERS: unique mentoring provision from jury members.Since big ideas need plenty of support to get off the ground, members of the project selection jury will also act as mentors during the creative process. BMW Group France would like to sincerely thank these major figures in the art world for accepting this role so enthusiastically and ensuring that the project and work meet the highest standards.The BMW ART MAKERS jury consists of:BMW ART MAKERS: financial and material support.And since big ideas need to be funded and given concrete expression, BMW Group France is offering:BMW ART MAKERS:thinking, creating, and most importantly... making things happen.Research and experimentation are only the starting points of the artistic project.

{"prompt":"Great Britain is full of history that can be experienced. Whether architecture, technology or natural monuments - the home country of the MINI is home to many impressive contemporary witnesses. And the narrow country roads are made for a premium compact sports car like the MINI Cooper S 5-door. But where to start? In the south of the island, for example, in West Sussex.  ->","completion":" Munich. At the time, no one could have known that the young pharmacist's assistant and assistant teacher, who earned a little money in the small English town of Midhurst, West Sussex, at the beginning of 1881, would become one of the greats of science fiction literature. His name: Herbert George Wells, the later creator of classics such as \"War of the Worlds\" and \"The Time Machine\". Can there be a better place than Midhurst to explore as part of the history of southern England with a modern time machine like the MINI Cooper S 5-door , which transfers the principle of creative use of space once conceived for the classic Mini to the present in a particularly convincing way?Midhurst itself, a town of 5,000 people in the county of West Sussex, is definitely worth a visit. It is located in the middle of the South Downs National Park, the youngest of the 15 national parks in England and Wales. The ruins of Tudor Cowdray House and Victorian Cowdray House give a first glimpse of the rich architectural heritage England has to offer. Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian architecture meet here, and the old market square has long been the meeting place for relaxed residents.No less narrow than the lanes in Midhurst are the small country roads that cross the national park. In typical English style, bushes and trees stand right at the edge of the tarmac ribbons, and pheasants poke their heads through the thicket or dash across the narrow carriageway every now and then.These tracks are the ideal terrain for a compact sports car like the MINI Cooper S 5-door, which can demonstrate its temperament here with its 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology. The drivetrain generates a maximum of 131 kW\/178 hp and accelerates the MINI Cooper S 5-door from zero to 100 km\/h in 6.8 seconds. Enough power to swiftly overtake the many agricultural vehicles used here for cattle farming and fruit growing.Those who want to explore the surrounding area of Midhurst have plenty of choice, as almost every village has a story to tell. We first decide to take a detour north to the Hollycombe Steam Collection at Liphook on the northern edge of the national park. Here, among other things, is an almost complete and usable steam fair from Edwardian times.After so much early industrial culture, we're happy to climb back into our ultra-modern MINI, which gleams in Island Blue metallic and catches the eye with its roof and exterior mirror caps in silver, its 18-inch Pulse Spoke 2-tone alloy wheels and Piano Black exterior, among other features. The redesigned and standard sports leather steering wheel with its multi-function button panels fits perfectly in the hand - it's time to explore more of West Sussex.To do this, the route leads south-east, past Petworth with its impressive baroque Petworth House, which houses a collection of old masters. But the place is also known for its literature festival in November. If you want to visit the ancient Romans, you only have to drive a few kilometres further south: In Bignor, the remains of a Roman villa were discovered by chance while ploughing in 1811. Beautiful mosaic floors and ceramics can still be seen today, the oldest pieces dating back to the first century AD.After another short drive, the MINI reaches Amberley - and anyone interested in technology should not drive past the Railway Museum there. Here, narrow-gauge trains built in 1880 and later roll along old tracks with a gauge of 610 millimetres. Their bizarreness already impressed the makers of the James Bond episode “A View to a Kill\" in the 1980s.In the neighbourhood of the River Rother, which at 56 kilometres is one of the longest rivers in Sussex and also flows through the middle of Midhurst, the A284 country road continues south to Arundel with its incredibly large castle. It is the seat of the Dukes of Norfolk, the first buildings having been built in 1068. Also worth seeing is the Parish Church of St Nicholas, built in 1380, and Hiorne Tower - an ornamental 18th century building in Arundel Park, last occupied in the 1950s.Next to it is the English Channel and Bognor Regis, one of the famous southern English seaside resorts. So unpack your swimwear from the luggage compartment of the MINI Cooper S 5-door. The luggage compartment holds 278 litres when all five seats are in use and can be expanded to 941 litres with only two occupants when the standard 60\/40 split rear seat backrest is folded down. Well refreshed, the road now leads inland again, to Chichester. The city is much more than just the administrative seat of West Sussex - its cathedral is famous, for example, but also its reputation as a shopping hotspot thanks to designer boutiques and art galleries.Not far from Chichester is the paradise of all fans of classic cars and sports and luxury cars: Goodwood. A visit is a must because, firstly, Goodwood House with its large and beautiful estates is an ideal place to relax. Secondly, the hilly aristocratic grounds with its integrated race track host the incomparable Festival of Speed and the Goodwood Revival every year. And thirdly, the BMW Group, to which MINI also belongs, builds automotive luxury in the Duke of Richmond's large garden: cars of the Rolls-Royce brand have been manufactured here since 2003.The route leads back towards Midhurst through the heathland of West Sussex and the ridges of the South Downs and the Weald as the highest elevations. This is where the new Adaptive Suspension of the MINI Cooper S 5-door comes into its own. Frequency-selective damping ensures an optimised balance between sportiness and ride comfort.An additional valve ensures that the damping forces are adjusted extremely quickly, so that the harmonious driving characteristics remain unaffected by the not exactly rare bumps in the English road surface. And the go-kart feeling - typical of the brand - can be felt in every one of the many bends.After a stop at the Weald and Downland Living Museum, which informs about the former country life of the area and fascinates with a Victorian classroom and a Tudor kitchen, the MINI Cooper S 5-door rolls back to Midhurst, where there is the opportunity to rest from the impressive journey and ponder H. G. Wells at the Swan Inn in Chichester Road.Incidentally, he was not the only prominent resident of the town. For example, Sir Alec Guinness, the man with a thousand faces, and William Henry Pratt - better known as Boris Karloff or even as Frankenstein's monster - also lived and died in Midhurst. You can't have England without a bit of horror. \n"}

The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team enters the finishing straight in the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in South America. ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’ in San Juan, Argentina, hosts the penultimate event of the season this weekend will again line up on the BMW M 1000 RR for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team in San Juan. The province of San Juan is located in the west of Argentina, roughly 180 kilometres north of Mendoza. With the 4.276-kilometre ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’, it is one of the country’s motorsport centres. WorldSBK also visited San Juan in 2018 and 2019. Quotes ahead of the San Juan races. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The successful weekend in Portimão gives us a lot of momentum for the final phase of the season. The team’s maiden victory in the Superpole race was just one aspect, as we saw that Michael was also in contention for a place on the podium in the two main races. We want to back that up, although we are well aware that different and new challenges now await us in Argentina and Indonesia. However, we have confirmed that we are heading in the right direction, and we want to continue that way. We are sorry that Tom will not be with us in Argentina, but we fully understand his decision to miss the races. Health always takes top priority. Our thanks go to Eugene, who is ready and will stand in for him again in San Juan.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We are pleased to be going back to Argentina for our first overseas event of the season. We are ready to fight for the podium again after a successful Portimão event. The team is well prepared. Once again, due to the recovery of Tom, Eugene will step in at this event. Hopefully, Eugene can pick up on his positions at Portimão. He did a very good job there and has a good experience at the San Juan circuit so he should be ready for the weekend. Mickey came away from Portugal with strong finishes. I think his confidence is on a high, the bike is working well for him and he also knows the San Juan circuit well. So overall, we feel that we are in a good position. It goes without saying that we really hope that Tom can get back soon and finish the season with the team. It is a shame that he could not make it to Argentina but we fully understand the circumstances regarding being in a fit condition to be able to travel overseas.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Personally I enjoy the San Juan track. It has a bit of everything, but there are a lot of tight corners, a lot of combinations and I am looking forward to going there. I think the organisation and Dorna did a fantastic job to make it happen. It is a World Championship and it is nice to go overseas and to go to Argentina. I think that already at Jerez, we started to make steps with the bike with some different set-up and we did a similar thing in Portimão which worked out really well. We were a bit unlucky with the crash in race one and a mechanical problem in race two but it seems that with the change we made on the bike, we can be really more competitive. It is always a question mark how it will go on a different track but at least we go there with a lot of confidence and knowing we can try a lot more things with the set-up now.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Firstly I must say a big well done to Dorna and all the teams for making this Argentinian round happen. This is the first time that we’ve travelled outside of Europe since the global pandemic really took hold 18 months ago and that’s a sure sign of progress. I really enjoy the Villicum circuit layout and I’ve enjoyed good results here in previous years. We made progress last time out at Portimão finishing in the top 10 in all three races and slowly but surely the bike is beginning to feel more like my bike. We’ll continue working on the chassis set-up to improve braking and turning during Friday practice as we aim to make another step closer towards fighting for that top 6 this weekend.” Track Facts San Juan.Circuit length4.276 km – anti-clockwiseCorners17 – 7 right-handers, 10 left-handersPole positionRightLongest straightApprox. 850 metresGrip levelExtremely lowTrack layoutMainly slow corners, stop&go characterStrain on brakesMediumAmount at full throttle29 %Top speed \/ lowest speed312 km\/h \/ 61 km\/hBest overtaking opportunityT10, T15Key factorsConfidence in the bike, engine performance, brake stability\n"}

The historic BMW M Motorsport endurance legends also provided some very special eye candy. DTM: Marco Wittmann ends the year fourth overall in the BMW M6 GT3’s farewell season.It was a visibly happy Marco Wittmann (GER) who emerged from the Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M6 GT3 after the 16th and final race of the DTM season. Seventh place in his home race at the Norisring was a successful end to what has, on the whole, been an extremely successful season. He finished fourth in the championship, with 171 points, two wins, two pole positions and five podiums to his name. “Finishing seventh was a satisfactory way to end the season. We were not expecting that before the race, so I am really happy,” said Wittmann. “I can be particularly pleased with fourth place overall in the championship. For me, the highs and the victories this season definitely outweigh anything else. The performances we gave this year were huge.” As well as Wittmann, ROWE Racing drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Timo Glock (GER) also raced in the DTM in the farewell season for the BMW M6 GT3, which will be replaced by the new BMW M4 GT4 in 2022. They finished eleventh and 17th in the Drivers’ Championship. BMW M2 Cup: Inaugural season a total success.The BMW M2 Cup crowned the champion of its inaugural season at the Norisring. Louis Henkefend (GER) won three races and scored a total of 177 points in the #17 BMW M2 CS Racing. “I am incredibly happy! That is a big load off my mind,” said Henkefend. “Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout the years. This title means an awful lot to me.” The goal of the BMW M2 Cup is to offer talented young drivers the opportunity to prove themselves and go head-to-head on a big stage in identical cars at the highest technological level. This goal was well and truly achieved. “It was fantastic to be there live at the Norisring for the finale of this season’s BMW M2 Cup, and to experience the magnificent atmosphere in Nuremberg. That is motorsport at its best,” said Thomas Felbermair, Vice President Sales and Marketing BMW M GmbH. “Congratulations to Louis Henkefend on winning the Driver title in the inaugural season of our new one-make cup with the BMW M2 CS Racing. His consistently strong displays make him a worthy champion. It was a great pleasure to see him and all the other drivers racing against each other at such a high level over the course of the season. The performances of the many talented young racers are confirmation that we were spot on with the alignment of our BMW M2 Cup.

Fittingly, the two title contenders ended up battling it out amongst themselves for the race win and with it the title. It was Green who eventually emerged triumphant, winning the race and defending the top spot in the overall standings. In total, Green won five races over the course of the season. Michael Schrey and Theo Oeverhaus (both GER) each one won race in the BMW M4 GT4. They ended the season fifth and sixth in the Drivers’ Championship. FK Performance Motorsport also won the Team title with 268 points. In the Manufacturers Championship, BMW was victorious with 302 points. BMW M Motorsport endurance legends thrill the crowds.One of the biggest favourites with the crowds in the Norisring paddock were the BMW M Motorsport endurance legends. BMW Group Classic presented some of the most spectacular and iconic BMW race cars, offering a taste of things to come when BMW M Motorsport enters the LMDh class from the 2023 season. Fans were able to admire and watch the following cars in action as they took to the track for a number of show runs: a replica of the 1973 BMW 3.0 CSL, the BMW M1 ‘Münchner Wirte’ from 1981, the 1992 BMW M3 E30, the BMW McLaren F1 GTR Long Tail from 1997, the BMW V12 LMR from 1999, and the 2015 BMW Z4 GT3.

After a breathtaking finish, the #37 BMW M 1000 RR crossed the finish line first to take the win. Alternating in the saddle were Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Markus Reiterberger (GER). Kenny Foray (FRA) was on standby as the third rider. Victory secured second place in the championship standings in the 2021 FIM EWC for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. Success in the FIM EWC came just one week after the first victory in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Foray qualified second to secure a good start position for the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. The turmoil at the start initially saw Mikhalchik drop back to sixth place, however he was soon able to work his way back towards the front of the field through a combination of speed and skill. After 15 minutes of racing, Mikhalchik was running second. Shortly after that, he moved to the head of the field on the #37 BMW M 1000 RR and set about opening a lead. Over the course of the race, which included two lengthy safety car periods, he and Reiterberger only surrendered the lead briefly twice. With a strong performance from the two riders, a smart strategy and a perfect BMW M 1000 RR, the team led for almost the entire race. Having said that, the closing stages were not for the faint-hearted. The #7 Yamaha from the YART team was closing all the time, however Reiterberger kept a cool head, used all his skill, paced the race perfectly and defended the lead to take the team’s maiden victory. After six hours of racing, and a real thriller, he took the chequered flag with a lead of just 0.070 seconds. 2021 was the second season in the FIM EWC for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. The new BMW M 1000 RR was used for the first time this year. The team finished third in the first two races, at Le Mans (FRA) and Estoril (POR). In race three, the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet (FRA), they were forced to retire with a technical issue. The acclaimed maiden victory came just a few weeks later in Most. Quotes after the race at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Congratulations to the team, Werner Daemen and the riders on their fantastic victory in Most. The race was a thriller, just as the whole season has been extremely exciting. We have experienced impressive fightbacks, podiums and setbacks this year. After the Bol d’Or, we were no longer in contention for the title, however it was clear that the team would give it their all in the final race here in Most. We looked very good in the test and backed that form up in the race. We knew that we had the pace to finish on the podium. To take victory at the end of such a close race is simply fantastic. It was a fantastic job from Ilya and Reiti, who was so impressive in bringing home the win, and the whole team, which worked perfectly in the garage. That is a great way to end the season. We will keep working and know that we still have a lot of challenges ahead of us. However, this is a great basis, we have a superb team, and we now head into the winter and preparations for 2022 with great motivation.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I am overjoyed. This weekend has been perfect from the word go. Together with the YART team, we were always first and second, in all the practice sessions and qualifying. To win the race by 0.07 seconds after six hours of racing is a dream. It is simply excellent, and I know how much work we have all invested in this success. Despite the races at Le Mans and Estoril not running entirely smoothly, we still finished on the podium. We then retired with a technical issue in the Bol d’Or, but these things can happen. Despite this, we still managed to finish the season in second place in the championship. I am proud of our riders and I am proud of the fact that we have taken all those involved and formed a team capable of challenging for the championship.” Markus Reiterberger: “I think that was a really breathtaking race to the chequered flag. Ilya was on the bike at the start. He overtook everyone in the first stint and we took the lead. We fancied a five-stop strategy, but for that to work you need a safety car. That is very probable at this track, and that is exactly what happened. We managed to make one stop fewer than YART, for example. I think fuel consumption was the key to success today, and the fact that we rode flawlessly. I gave it everything in my last stint and rode against the clock. That was very tough, because Marvin Fritz was really pushing behind me. It was really very close, but I did it. I am grateful that we have finally won, as the whole team has more than earned it. This is the reward for the huge amount of hard work. Thank you to the team, BMW and everyone who has supported us. This is a really nice way to end the season.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am so happy. We got our first win and it’s really an amazing feeling, especially after the bad luck we had at the Bol d’Or. Now we are also second in the world championship and this gives us extra motivation. The race was almost perfect because in the last two hours I was nearly 30 minutes behind the safety car and afterwards I was struggling a bit with the tyres and it was not easy to get back to a fast pace. In the last 50 minutes Markus did a great job. He rode a really fast pace. We won the race, even if it was with a very small gap. It is an amazing feeling and I want to say thank you to the entire team, to my family, everyone – I am just happy.” Kenny Foray: “It was a fantastic race from my team-mates and from my team. I came here on Monday, I did not know the track and my job was just to help the team whenever there is a problem. Of course, I would have liked to ride in the race, but my team-mates did a fantastic job. I am really happy for them, for the team and for BMW. The first win is a great result for us. I am also happy because I rode three races this season and we finished second in the world championship and it is always great to end a season like this. So a big thank you goes to my team.” \n"}

With the award Mujinga wins a major solo exhibition next year in one of the Nationalgalerie’s institutions as well as an accompanying publication.“The jury has decided to award this year’s Preis der Nationalgalerie to Sandra Mujinga. Sandra Mujinga works across a variety of media, with her presentation at Hamburger Bahnhof placing a focus on her sculptural practice. On the one hand, the works display a great sensibility for craft and materiality. Yet, with them, Mujinga is also able to reconcile contradictory experiences: ostensibly familiar forms disappear before we are able to grasp them; her spectral figures appear ominous, but also seem to offer their protection; although static, they exhibit an inherent dynamism; and they are both finished, but also seemingly in a state of becoming. Her negotiation of these contradictions opens up a space for imagination on the part of the viewer. The topics addressed by her works resonate greatly with the present moment, while also seeming to come from a future already passed. They remind us to be considerate of other living beings for the sake of our own survival, and that we can observe and learn from their various strategies of adapting to an ever-changing world”, stated the jury in its unanimous decision.“Since 2013, after being awarded the Preis der Nationalgalerie, Marianna Castillo Deball, Anne Imhof, Agnieszka Polska, and Pauline Curnier Jardin have come up with incredibly impressive presentations for the Hamburger Bahnhof. I would like to give my sincerest thanks to the members of the jury for today’s lively discussion and congratulate Sandra Mujinga, whose exhibition we will now spend the coming year preparing,” stated Dr Gabriele Knapstein, head of Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin.Dr Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance, said about the newly announced winner, “Looking at past nominees and their later careers, the significance of the shortlist has become very clear.

The BMW Group delivered 1,932,236 BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles to customers in the year to the end of September – a significant increase in sales of +17.9 percent year-on-year. All brands reported sales growth in all regions of the world. The company continued to build on its strong competitive position in key core markets such as the US, Europe and China. “The sales success of the past nine months shows how our customers appreciate our strong, sustainable and emotionally engaging product line-up. We have so far been able to offset the semiconductor supply bottlenecks over the full year with a strong operating performance. We are confident we can meet our ambitious sales targets and achieve solid, profitable growth for 2021,” said Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. “We have more than doubled our sales of fully-electric vehicles since the start of the year – and are therefore underscoring our impressive electro-offensive,” Nota continued. BMW iX, BMW i4 and BMW iX3* underpin electromobility ramp-up The BMW Group sold 231,576 electrified vehicles worldwide between January and September (+98.9%). Third-quarter sales of fully-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles climbed 43.1 percent year-on-year to reach 78,333 units. With a total of 59,688 pure electric vehicles delivered to customers, the BMW Group has seen a 121.4 percent increase in sales since the start of 2021. In particular, the fully-electric BMW iX3*, which has also been available in Europe since the start of the year, gave sales a major boost, with a total of 20,887 units sold in the year to date. “With the launch of the BMW iX and BMW i4 from November, we will have two new vehicles in the market that will further accelerate the ramp-up of electromobility. New orders worldwide already reflect our customers’ enthusiasm for these new models,” explained PieterNota. Over the coming years, the BMW Group will be expanding its e-mobility offering to include fully-electric versions of the BMW 7 Series, BMW X1 and the high-volume BMW 5 Series, as well as the successor to the MINI Countryman and the solely fully-electric Rolls-Royce Spectre, which was recently announced for the fourth quarter of 2023. By 2023, the BMW Group will have at least one fully-electric model on the roads in about 90 percent of its current market segments. Between now and 2025, the company plans to increase its sales of fully-electric models by an average of well over 50 percent per year – and will reach more than ten times the number of units sold in 2020. The BMW Group expects fully-electric vehicles to account for at least 50 percent of its global sales in 2030. Over the next ten years or so, the company plans to release a total of about ten million fully-electric vehicles onto the roads. Availability of semiconductor components remains problematicIn the first nine months of the year, the BMW Group made individual adjustments to its production programme in response to the limited availability of semiconductor components. The company expects the supply situation for semiconductor components to remain difficult. Although the BMW Group has so far been able to absorb the impact of these bottlenecks, the possibility of sales being affected in the coming months cannot be ruled out. BMW brand posts significant growth in year to dateIn the year to the end of September, 19.3 percent more BMW vehicles . With sales growth of 11.8 percent and delivery of 724,933 vehicles, the Europe region continued to expand its market share in the premium segment. In its domestic market of Germany, new BMW Group registrations were up 1.4 percent year-on-year, at 204,842.

The artist selected by curator Attilia Fattori Franchini to create the latest edition of BMW Open Work by Frieze is the Los An-geles-based Madeline Hollander will present a live, site-specific installation in the BMW Lounge at Frieze London in 2021.  ->","completion":" Munich\/London. For the fifth consecutive year, BMW and Frieze continue their long-term partnership with the major art initiative BMW Open Work by Frieze. Drawing inspiration from BMW engineering the project brings together art, technology and design in pioneering multi-platform formats. The artist selected by curator Attilia Fattori Franchini to create the latest edition of BMW Open Work by Frieze is the Los Angeles-based Madeline Hollander, who introduced the commission through an interactive digital platform and livery intervention on BMW i3 electric vehicles during Frieze Week 2020, and will present a live, site-specific installation in the BMW Lounge at Frieze London in 2021. As in previous years, BMW will also provide the VIP shuttle service transporting the fair’s VIP guests with the new all electric BMW iX.Working with performance, film and installation, Hollander explores how the human body in motion negotiates its limits within everyday systems of technology and engineering, industrial apparatus, intellectual property and daily rituals. Her performances and installations present perpetually looping events that intervene within spatial, psychological and temporal landscapes, and engage with novel modes of viewership. Titled “Sunrise\/Sunset” the project continues the artist's recent research into traffic patterns and working without human actors to depict unseen systems or processes. Emerging from an inspiring dialogue with the department responsible for sustainability at BMW Group and investigation into the automatic adaptive system of BMW headlights, Hollander created for Frieze London 2021, a site-specific, and self-sufficient, live installation composed of one hundred recycled BMW LED headlights from the BMW Group Recycling and Dismantling Centre. Thus, the artist developed an energetic loop, a networked map choreographed by the sunsets and sunrises across the globe. Fascinated by the responsive nature of headlights technology which reacts to a number of factors such as movement, light and weather conditions, the artist synced each headlight to different time zones creating a live and ceaseless global clock. In Hollander’s work our apparently erratic individual actions and everyday technologies synchronically align, becoming a collective, and in this case cascading-dance. The installation is accompanied by an original score created for the occasion by the composer Celia Hollander.In addition to Madeline Hollander’s commission for BMW Open Work by Frieze, Superblue and BMW i will present the world premiere of “No One is an Island”, a collaboration between Random International and Studio Wayne McGregor. “No One is an Island” is fuelled by science and explores electrified movement steered by advanced algorithms. It is a future-oriented reflection on how the human mind empathises with artificial intelligence and automated processes. The performance comprises sculptural, performative, and musical aspects.The centrepiece is a sculpture by Random International that experiments with the minimal amount of information that is actually necessary for an animated form to be recognised as human; and the fundamental impact created by subtle changes within that information. As it transitions from robot to human likeness, dancers from Company Wayne McGregor interact with the sculpture in a live, kinetic performance, further exploring the relationship between humans and technology and our capacity to empathise with a machine. The dancer’s interventions scored by Chihei Hatakeyama add a performative dimension to the sculpture, re-translating and celebrating the connection between human and mechanical movement. On the occasion of Frieze London, the installation will be shown publicly from October 13 to 16 daily between 3:00 and 7:00pm at Park Village Studios. To visit, please register here.BMW Open Work by FriezeNow in its fifth year, and curated by Attilia Fattori Franchini, BMW Open Work by Frieze gives artists and researchers a platform to push the boundaries of their work, starting the project with a creative dialogue between arts, technology, engineering and design to pursue their practice in innovative new directions. For its premier in 2017, artist Olivia Erlanger integrated a motion-sensitive sculpture, audio and immersive fog in her work “Body Electric”; in 2018, Sam Lewitt engaged with BMW intellectual property and engine production to conceptually and physically explore the production cycle of a BMW engine in “CORE (the ‘Work’)”; in 2019, Camille Blatrix collaborated with BMW Individual to explore the primal and emotional relationships to labor and materiality, raising questions about functionality and desire in the installation “Sirens”. \n"}

A premiere for the 2021 finale: the Autodrom Most in the Czech Republic is hosting the FIM Endurance World Championship (EWC) for the first time this season. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team will be racing there this coming weekend . At race three at Le Castellet, the team was again involved in the battle for the podium but was forced to retire early due to a technical problem. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is heading to the finale in fifth position in the championship standings, 21 points behind second place. Quotes ahead of the season finale at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The finale will once again be really exciting with the intense six-hour race at Most. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team has done some outstanding work this season and has been one of the teams battling for the world championship title. Retiring due to technical problems at Le Castellet was certainly a setback, but that can always happen in endurance racing – what we saw on more than one occasion at Le Castellet. However, we still have the chance to reach the rostrum in the overall world championship standings. A world championship podium would be just reward for the entire team and for the riders, after all their efforts in this project and I know that they will give their all to round off the season with this success.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “Our objective at Most is pretty simple, we are going to try to win there. We had some really good testing there and I hope that we can turn those test results into race results. Our riders are extremely motivated, the motorbike is perfect. We have all the ingredients to reach the podium and also to aim for the win. We are sorry that Xavi has to miss this race, and we all wish him a speedy recovery.” Markus Reiterberger: “Our testing at Most was good and we are well set for the final six-hour sprint. I haven't been back to Most for a long time and I will have to get to the know the circuit again. I like it a lot and I am looking forward to the finale. It will be a real sprint race. We did well during testing, the team has prepared the bike well and I also think that the circuit suits our Dunlop tyres. I hope that the weather is on our side, that we will have another great race weekend and round off the season in a successful way. The team has earned a reward for all the hard work and I hope that we can manage it.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I know the Most track well and the BMW M 1000 RR works well on that circuit. So our whole package is good and we are ready. Six hours is like a sprint race and I think that we will have a good fight with the other factory teams. We again want to show our potential, enjoy the race and try to fight for the top again at the final race of the season.” Kenny Foray: “First of all, I am very sorry for Xavi and whish him a speedy recovery. So I stand in in the last moment, but I am happy to discover a new track and I hope that I can help the team to get a good result in the race and to finish the season on a high.” \n"}

The chequered flag for the Superpole race on Sunday morning at Portimão (POR) was greeted with boundless celebrations in the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team pit area. Michael van der Mark (NED) won the race on his BMW M 1000 RR and the team celebrated the first win for BMW Motorrad Motorsport since returning to the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). The result marks the next important milestone for the project. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, was at Portimão for the race weekend and was the first to offer his congratulations. Van der Mark was already on fast form during the rainy warm-up session, posting the best time on Sunday morning. The rain had stopped in time for the Superpole race but the circuit had not dried out. Starting from fifth on the grid, van der Mark had already moved up to third by the end of lap one. He then passed Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR \/ Yamaha) and moved into second place on lap two. On the next lap, he left Scott Redding (GBR \/ Ducati) behind to take the lead. Van der Mark never looked likely to surrender his lead, claiming the long-awaited first win after ten laps – fully 5.330 seconds ahead of his rivals. Having won the Superpole race, van der Mark started the afternoon’s second race from pole position. That race took place in sunny conditions on a dry surface. However, a technical issue prevented him from mounting a real attack and he completed the second race in sixth place. Eugene Laverty (IRL), racing in place of Tom Sykes (GBR) again at Portimão, moved up from 13th on the grid to ninth position in the Superpole race. In the afternoon’s second race, he crossed the line in tenth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team completed the Superpole race in 13th place, and then crossed the line in 15th position in the afternoon’s second race. As the team will not be competing in the two upcoming overseas events, these were Folger’s last WorldSBK races of the season. The Italian privateer team B-Max Racing Team raced at Portimão with a wildcard for rider Gabriele Ruiu (ITA). Ruiu finished 15th in the Superpole race. He retired early from both main races over the weekend. The eleventh round of the season at Portimão marks the end of the European season in the WorldSBK 2021. The racing continues in two weeks with the penultimate event of the season in Argentina, while the finale will take place in Indonesia in November. Quotes after race two at Portimão. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: “It is something special to secure the first win for a project like this. I also think that we as a team have deserved this, and it shows that we are heading in the right direction. We are all proud of this win, which is an important step for the project that we are aiming to develop gradually. Congratulations to Michael van der Mark, the entire BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and everyone involved in this success. I would like to thank them all for their efforts and their hard work.” Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “This win is a real milestone for our project. It is just brilliant and I would like to thank the entire team. Thanks to BMW Motorrad as well for supporting this project. The conditions were pretty special this morning with the wet surface. Mickey showed during the warm-up that he is extremely fast and then produced a superb performance in the Superpole race. We know that the motorbike also goes really well in the wet. None of us will forget him crossing the line in a hurry. The pole position then gave us the best starting position you can have for the second race. Unfortunately, Mickey was struggling with an issue but that cannot spoil our delight at his victory. Eugene was not so happy with the motorbike in the wet this morning, but we were still able to make progress for the Superpole race and he recorded another two top-ten finishes. Overall, it was a really positive weekend for us.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am really, really happy for everyone in the project. We have worked very, very hard to get into this position. We are ambitious and we have proved that by the steps we have made over the years. It is still very early in the project considering we lost almost a year due to Covid. I am pleased for Mickey as well. To put him back on the podium and then to win that race just gives him the confidence and knowing we are going in the right direction. This weekend we knew all along, from qualifying on. We had a good pace in the wet and in the dry and I think that was the reward for him and the whole team so I am really pleased for everybody. In race two, Mickey made an okay start. We lost a few places but he was in the right group but we had a technical issue in the middle of the race. At that point he was second quickest on track and I think the podium for sure was in sight, but with the circumstances, the wind conditions and everything, we take that sixth position. For Eugene to stand in on the second weekend in a row he did a fantastic job. To finish in the top-ten against guys who have been racing in the championship for the full season just shows the quality there so he has done exactly what we expected from him. Overall, it has been a successful weekend. Now we are heading overseas and we hope we can get Tom fit and ready for Argentina and get the team back to full strength.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Yeah, it was a pretty good day. Of course, this morning it was nice to get a win with the BMW M1000 RR. It was a good race and I already felt good in the rain from this morning, and this carried through into the race, even when it started to dry, I still had a good feeling on the bike. I’m happy to take the win for BMW Motorrad and the whole team. Race 2 I didn’t get a good start, but I felt I had good pace but unfortunately we had some issues which cost me a lot of time and then my race from there was a bit lonely as I couldn’t catch up the guys in front. We have to learn, but at the end it was not a bad Sunday.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was an OK day, but I am not satisfied with the race results as I wanted to be further up the field. We have tried to make the bike mine and we did make some progress in the dry race this afternoon, but I still couldn’t get the bike to load the front and have agility, so it was tough to finish like that. The wet race was nice. I did struggle in the first three laps to get heat into the rear tyre but once I got some temperature in the tyre it was enjoyable, and we got a good result from it.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It’s a case of mixed emotions for me. On the one hand, I am sad to be leaving the team. On the other hand, I am also a little bit relieved that a difficult year is now over. The final race was not an easy one either, as I had problems in the apex and when exiting corners. I couldn’t do any proper slides out of the turn, as my slides were really aggressive, so I just got it to the finish line. I would like to thank the whole team. We moved up to the WorldSBK together this year. They are all great people and we had a lot of fun together. I will certainly remember the great moments and they will all have a place in my heart.” \n"}

Laverty was also going well but fell after sliding during the closing stage of the qualifying session. That prevented him from bettering the lap time already posted and he finished in 13th place. Folger finished Superpole in 19th position. Van der Mark initially fell back a few places at the start of the first race. However, a great recovery performance saw him move back up to swiftly become part of the chasing pack battling for the third spot on the podium. However, his charge to the podium came to an end on lap 15 out of 20 when a rider touched his rear wheel on entry to turn five, causing him to fall. Van der Mark got back up and re-joined but was forced to head for the pits and retire. Laverty moved up into the top ten at the start. As the race progressed, he fell back a little but then found his rhythm, crossing the finish line in ninth place. After 20 race laps, Folger secured 15th place to score one point. Quotes after race one at Portimão. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We made good progress in the third practice session this morning. Michael gave an outstanding performance in qualifying. He often struggles with the qualifying tyres and it was amazing to get him into fifth place. Eugene had an unfortunate fall and had to be content with 13th place. Mickey didn't get the start quite right and he was back in twelfth place after the first few turns, but once again, he gave a very, very good chasing performance. We were right in the battle for the podium. Michael said that he would have made it and he had already moved into an overtaking position. Unfortunately, Andrea Locatelli then touched him from behind and caused the fall. That finished off the race for him. It was a real shame as he was clearly in with a chance of reaching the podium. So, we’ll start the Superpole race tomorrow from P5 and then we’ll see what’s possible. Eugene rode a consistent race and I am confident that he will be able to take another step forward tomorrow at his home circuit.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Eugene did a good job today. He rode a good race and came strong at the end which we know he can do. Superpole was difficult for him and we didn’t get the Q tyre to work for him very well but in the end, he did a good job so credit to Eugene for that performance. I am still a bit lost for words on the Michael situation. Nevertheless, we have to dust ourselves down and build Mickey up overnight and get him ready for the Superpole race. We are clearly disappointed as we had the podium in sight which is what I think we deserved this weekend.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This morning we changed a lot on the bike compared to yesterday and I felt really good in FP3. In Superpole, I had a good lap and I ended up starting in P5. That was a good step for us and I was really happy with the starting position. During race one, I messed up the start and got stuck in traffic at T1, so I lost a lot of places. After that I had a good pace and was catching the group in front of me. I managed to get past those guys and had some good battles but unfortunately, I got taken out at T5 by Locatelli which was a shame because we were fighting for the podium with Bautista and Baz. But that is racing, and we try again tomorrow.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am happy with that race result because we have been working progressively forward all weekend. The guys did a fantastic job in making the bike feel like my bike which made me feel like home. We qualified low but had a fantastic first few corners and gained a lot of positions. Unfortunately, we had a problem with the clutch at the start and had issues in corner entry but once I got used to this problem, I settled into a good rhythm and got a good result. Without this problem at the beginning, I think we could have been higher up today.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Superpole and the race were really difficult today. In Superpole, we were unable to make use of the advantages the qualifying tyres normally bring. Unfortunately, I made a bad start to the race from 19th on the grid. I was playing catch-up for a long time and wasn’t able to build up a good feel with the rear and front grip. I was struggling all through the race. We did manage to score one point, as some riders ahead of us took a tumble, but overall the race was rather disappointing.” \n"}

In this way, elements from the core of BMW i, which stands for sustainable, future-oriented and forward-looking mobility, are recreated.“Catalysed by the partnership with BMW i and the collaboration with Studio Wayne McGregor, we have elevated our ongoing ‘Fifteen Points’ series of sculptures to a whole new level. Through the addition of both a score by Chihei Hatakeyama and dedicated choreography by Wayne McGregor, we are able to explore in much more detail the as-of-yet unknown territories of 'empathy with machines’. The work is part of a wider reflection on our human need to relate to our surroundings; how does such a need to connect play out in light of an increasing automation and digitisation of our environment? Will our willingness to engage with unknown systems leave us more vulnerable? We are much looking forward to presenting the work in a series of live performances in 2021,” says Hannes Koch, one of the founders and directors of Random International about the collaboration.“What I find inspiring about the partnership with Random International, Superblue, BMW i and myself is that we all come together from different knowledge sets, but convene in areas of shared interest,” says Wayne McGregor. “We are all fascinated by the potential of the human body, its relationship with and to technology but most importantly our desire to generate empathetic connections between people. This is a dialogue of inter-connectedness, exploration, and surprise. We have no pre-determined road map – instead, we feed from one another’s expertise and ideas to push ourselves towards new horizons.” Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst, Co-Founder and CEO of Superblue says, “Creating new platforms and opportunities for experiential artists to collaborate is core to Superblue’s mission, so we are delighted to partner on this project and creative dialogue between Random International, Studio Wayne McGregor, and BMW i. ‘No One is an Island’ provokes questions about the dynamics between technology and humanity that are critical to deepening our understanding of our relationship to the world and each other.”“We believe that working together with great artists like Random International, represented by Superblue, and Studio Wayne McGregor is an inspiring and enriching experience for all parties involved. Speaking of BMW i, the constant exchange with creatives is essential. And just as BMW i embodies innovation, ‘No One is an Island’ synergises future and present, technology and humanity,” says Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand Experience.Public Days:October 13 to 16, 2021Daily performance at 3.00pm, 3.30pm, 4.00pm, 4.30pm, 5.30pm, 6.00pm and 6.30pm.Park Village Studios1 Park Village E,London NW1 7PXTo visit the performance, it’s necessary to register here.(https:\/\/emt.bmw-arts-design.com\/exhibition-random-international?partner=mSSgv4ANIz) \n"}
{"prompt":"If you want to explore the world, you need a thirst for knowledge, a  thirst for adventure and a four-wheel drive MINI Countryman. With it, you can travel safely even where more than half of the country's  inhabitants firmly believe in the existence of supernatural beings - in  Iceland. Especially a trip to the Westfjords, which are little developed  for tourists, brings visitors closer to the life and culture of the  islanders and breathtaking nature.  ->","completion":" Reykjavik. Anyone who wanted to know where elves, fairies, gnomes or trolls lived could once ask Erla Stefansdottir. She was Iceland's elf commissioner and often advised the building authority so that new roads would not cross magical places. In this respect, when travelling by car from the capital Reykjavik along the few paved and unpaved roads to the most westerly places in Europe, one need not fear waking sleeping supernatural beings. Especially not in the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 If you want to experience Iceland, you can't avoid using part of the Ring Road 1 from the capital Reykjavik. Even here, the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 with its smooth-running two-litre four-cylinder engine shows just how good it is to travel with 131 kW\/178 hp. The MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 - supported by the eight_x0002_speed Steptronic gearbox - accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h in 7.3 seconds. However, it cannot live up to its possible top speed of 222 km\/h because more than 90 km\/h is not permitted anywhere. On gravel roads - and there are many of them, as in Iceland only about 4300 kilometres of road are asphalted - the maximum speed is 80 km\/h, and even that can be too fast.Heading west, the \"1\" first takes island explorers to Bogarnes, the economic centre of West Iceland with a fabulous panoramic view. The town's hot water comes from Iceland's largest hot water spring, Deildartunguhver, with 180 litres per second. From here, it is worth taking a detour along highway 54 to the 167-square-kilometre Snaefellsjökull National Park, dominated by a 1446-metre-high volcanic cone. Thousands of seabirds populate the Londrangar rock towers. Also worth seeing is Dritvik Bay with the ruins of the only fishing station and the black lava gravel beach of Djupalonssandur.Even though many paths along the coasts can only be explored by feet, the ALL4 all-wheel drive system provides Icelanders with the best traction wherever cars are allowed to drive. After all, loose ground and water crossings are commonplace on almost every tour in Iceland.The system is based on an electromechanically operating centre differential that distributes the drive power continuously between the front and rear axles - depending on requirements. Up to 100 percent can be directed to the rear; the normal driving condition ensures a 50:50 distribution. The 16.5 centimetres of ground clearance of the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 has a calming effect on Iceland, because even asphalt roads surprise with deep potholes due to frost, among other things, which the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 can easily cope - thanks to plenty of space under the floor and a sophisticated chassisContinue to the small fishing town of Stykkisholmur, once a trading centre of the German Hanseatic League, now proud of its striking modern church and many old homes. Turn left from the 54 onto the 60 heading north, leading travellers to the particularly wild and pristine Westfjords landscape, where the land masses between the fjords look like fingers stretching towards Greenland. The 60 and 62 lead to the westernmost point of Europe, Bjargtangar lighthouse, on the 14-kilometre-long Lätrabjarg cliff. Among other things, thousands of puffins live on rocks with a maximum height of 440 metres - a real change from the sight of the many sheep and Icelandic horses that otherwise populate the island.Maybe this is the right place to spend the night - why not in a roof tent carried along by the Italian manufacturer Autohome? The black box weighs 58 kilos and measures 210 by 130 centimetres. With the carrier, the MINI is just 2.05 metres high. Setting up the tent is easy: unlock the box at the front and back, gas pressure springs open the flap. The tent is boarded via an aluminium folding ladder. Mesh pockets hold the little things people need every night, and an LED light provides a clear view. The next morning, the box is closed again with straps, and that's it.Freshly fortified, we continue to our next destination, Bildudalur - and because we are in the land of elves and trolls, you must visit the creepy Skrimslasetrid Museum for Sea Monsters and Monsters in Strandgata 7 to enjoy interactive and multimedia entertainment. Things get louder further north at Dynjandi, where you'll find the \"Thundering\", \"Roaring\" or \"Raging\": Iceland's probably most beautiful waterfall is around 100 metres high and shines with six steps. The protected natural monument is 30 metres wide at the top and 60 metres wide at the bottom and extremely impressive.Almost like the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4, which at an overall length of 4.3 metres and a wheelbase of 2.67 metres, it offers plenty of space for five people. A few more live in Isafjördur further north - with 2700 inhabitants, the town marks the Westfjord metropolis with captain's houses, fishermen's monument and an archway made of whalebone. This is the right place for souvenir shopping, which can be safely stored in the boot with a minimum capacity of 450 litres. If only two people are travelling, the souvenirs can be much larger - in this case the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 can hold up to 1390 litres. Enough space to take a little salt with you: In Reykjanes, it's worth visiting the \"Salzverk\" - salt is extracted from the earth in a climate_x0002_friendly way with the help of 100-degree hot water. \n"}

As Worldwide Partner, BMW has underlined its status as an outstanding partner for the game of golf. With the ‘Ultimate Journey,’ we have created an unforgettable moment.”The Americans, who were able to call upon the services of eighth of the world’s top ten, lived up to their billing as favourites from the first tee shot and led by 11:5 after the doubles matches. Captain Steve Stricker’s team was also by far the stronger in the singles and pushed on to win by the biggest margin since 1979, the first time a European team appeared in the Ryder Cup. The biggest victory prior to this year’s event was a 18.5:9.5 achieved by Europe in 2006 and 2004 and the USA in 1981.One of the few bright spots for the defending champions was Sergio García, who set a new record on Saturday morning with his 24th match win, passing the previous record holder Sir Nick Faldo (ENG).

The tenth race weekend of the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) was overshadowed by a fatal accident involving Spain’s Dean Berta Viñales. The young rider crashed in Saturday’s Supersport 300 race. The thoughts of BMW Motorrad Motorsport are with Viñales’ family, friends and team. We would like to offer them our sincere condolences. After the tragic accident, all the remaining races scheduled for Saturday were cancelled. In consultation with Viñales’ family, it was decided to continue the race weekend on Sunday and to stage the races in memory of the young rider. On Sunday morning, the paddock paid its respects with a minute’s silence. Sunday’s itinerary was amended to feature two 20-lap WorldSBK races. Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team ended race one in seventh place. He then finished eighth in race two. Deputizing for Van der Mark’s team-mate, Tom Sykes (GBR), in Jerez de la Frontera was Eugene Laverty (IRL). In light of the injury that Sykes suffered last Sunday in Barcelona, the decision was taken for him to sit out the Jerez weekend. Laverty was 12th and 11th in the two races. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team finished 14th in race one and crossed the finish line 13th in race two. Quotes after the races at Jerez de la Frontera. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The sad news of Dean Berta Viñales’ death was a shock to all of us. On behalf of BMW Motorrad Motorsport, I would like to express our sincere sympathy to his relatives. It was not easy to get back to the sporting action after this tragic accident. “Regarding our weekend: I think we do have solid results with seventh and eighth, which I am pleased with. However, the weekend was compromised by a not so good qualifying with all the BMWs starting from the fifth row. So Michael starting from 13th and ending up in seventh and eighth was definitely a solid performance. The gap to the podium was not so big. So we have to work on our qualifying performance and then we can make the next step. Jonas definitely had two of his better races. He was right up there with Eugene. For Eugene, of course, it was difficult to jump on the bike again after missing some rounds. We tried hard to get him a good feeling on the bike, but did not entirely get there. Both of them, Eugene and Jonas, were about 27 to 30 seconds off the win, which is for Jonas definitely one of the best results he has had this year. It is pleasing to see that he is going forward.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First of all commiserations to the Viñales family. It was devastating news yesterday. I think the paddock has really pulled together and raced today in memory of Dean. It is sad to be racing under these circumstances. “Mickey really struggled in qualifying yesterday. It is clear that we couldn’t master the two Qs he had, so starting from that grid position was always going to be a challenge. We did not expect to get to the top eight, but he was seventh and eighth, battling his way through. It is quite clear that when you are coming from so far back you are using the best of your tyre to get into that position, and at the end you have nothing to fight with. He just defended his position. Mickey has had a very strong Sunday. Eugene came back after a longer lay-off, stood in for Tom, and I have to say that he has done a great job. He did two great races. He quickly made up the places that he was able to. He got his head down and really ground through the laps, as we know how he can do in race conditions, and he came away with two strong positions. Now we bring the curtain down on what has been a really difficult weekend for everybody in the WorldSBK paddock and move on to Portugal.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a difficult weekend for the WorldSBK paddock. I want to express my condolences to Dean’s family and friends. Today we raced for him. Our results haven’t been bad when you see where we came from. Yesterday, I had no confidence to go faster so I was a bit disappointing. After a lot of studying the data the guys changed a lot on the bike and already this morning in warm-up I felt a big improvement. Also in both of today’s races I felt a massive step forward. And if you look at our lap times, the consistency and also the gap to the winner and the podium guys, I think we made a solid step. That gives me a lot of confidence and that is what we need. We have tried some things that will for sure be helping in the future.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First of all, my thoughts are with Dean’s family and friends and I’d like to express my condolences to them. It was a shock for all of us when we heard of the tragic loss of such a young life yesterday. Sporting wise, my objective was to be closer to the front, so I’m disappointed with the race results. We were working all weekend to get the bike to feel more like the bike that I had in the second half of last year and the first half of this year, but it just felt like a different bike under acceleration. Something was amiss in terms of power delivery on corner exit and we didn’t have enough time on track to really get to the bottom of it. I did what I could and a big thank you to BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team for allowing me to come back for this weekend.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was not easy to focus on the job at hand again today. A crash with fatal consequences is not easy to block out. My deepest sympathy goes to the relatives of Dean Berta Viñales. From my own perspective, I am really happy with my races today. The early laps did not go as I hoped, as I was struggling with the new tyres, which lost their grip very quickly and were very erratic. However, after five or six laps I was able to establish my rhythm and could feel the bike better. After race one we knew what we had to do. I battled against good people and could see where the differences were. I then carried a lot of confidence into race two. I again had difficulties with the new tyres in the first few laps, but then rode a great race. I was able to overtake and, towards the end, bridged the gap to Leon Haslam and Eugene Laverty. That showed how much better things were this weekend than they have been. We took a step forward, which is nice to see.” \n"}

In beautiful late summer weather, the BMW Junior Team finished round eight of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) on the podium. After four hours of racing, Neil Verhagen (USA), Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER) crossed the finish line in third place in the # 44 BMW M6 GT3. In the end, the trio was only 14 hundredths of a second short of second place. The new BMW M4 GT3 took the chequered flag in fifth place. The #55 car was driven by Philipp Eng (AUT) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). In qualifying on Saturday morning, that had to be shortened to 45 minutes due to fog, the BMW Juniors secured third on the grid. The start of the race was postponed by half an hour to 12:30. In the turmoil of the first corners the #44 BMW M6 GT3 initially fell back to sixth place, but Verhagen, Harper and Hesse quickly worked their way back towards the front. In the exciting final stages, Hesse put the second placed Audi in front of him under massive pressure, but he couldn’t find the opportunity to overtake, and this was also due to Code 60 zones. After four hours, the #44 BMW M6 GT3 crossed the line in third. After the wins in races four and five and second place in round seven, this was the next podium success for the BMW Junior Team. The #55 BMW M4 GT3 once again took part out of competition in the prototype class SP-X. Because of this, Eng and Farfus started the race behind the field of SP9 cars. In its second race the new car again ran without any problems and improved position by position. After four hours of racing, Farfus took the flag in fifth place. The gap to the front was only 86 seconds. Walkenhorst Motorsport finished third in the SP9 Am class with the #36 BMW. The car was driven by Henry Walkenhorst, Friedrich von Bohlen and Jörg Breuer (all GER). The team’s #34 BMW M6 GT3, with David Pittard (GBR), Ben Tuck (GBR) and Christian Krognes (NOR) at the wheel, was in second place after a fantastic start. Pittard also set a new NLS lap record in 7:53.202 minutes. But then, the #34 fell far back due to a damaged tyre. In the different classes, the BMW M Motorsport teams claimed a total of four class wins. The season finale of the 2021 Nürburgring Endurance Series will be held in two weeks’ time, on 9th October. Reactions after round eight of the 2021 NLS. Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “It has been a great and for us an entirely positive day of racing in the Eifel mountains. It started with the fact that spectators were again allowed onto the starting grid. That made the atmosphere very special. The race itself once again went smoothly. Our BMW Juniors Neil, Dan and Max put in another great performance, and Max’s fight for second place in the final laps was really breathtaking. It didn’t quite work out, but third place is another great result. Also Philipp’s and Augusto’s race in the new BMW M4 GT3 was fantastic. Both once again confirmed that the handling and performance of the new car are excellent. The BMW M4 GT3 is fast and easy to drive. Overall, the race went trouble-free for us from A to Z. I would like to thank the entire development team, BMW Team RMG, the drivers and everyone involved in the project for their great work.” Max Hesse, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “We gave our everything and a couple of times it could have nearly worked out. But in the end, the Audi had a bit more top speed than us, and exiting the Code 60 zone at the Döttinger Höhe there was no chance. And we all know: to overtake on the Nordschleife is not the easiest task. But it is great to be on the podium again. We also collected good points for the championship – the fight is on!” Neil Verhagen, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “We are happy with another podium. We have now been on the podium regularly after the 24-hour race. This is good; it shows our consistency and how we have been improving since the beginning of the year. A big thank you to BMW M Motorsport, BMW Team RMG and Shell for continuing to improve. At the end of the race it was difficult to overtake the Audi. We were able to catch up quite quickly, but unfortunately it was very difficult to find a way around. Overall, again it has definitely been a very solid weekend. It will be an eventful last race. Looking at the championship, it is going to be quite close. I am looking forward to it!“ Dan Harper, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “The final laps have been very intense to watch from the pit box. It was a really great fight, even if it did not quite work out for us. Unfortunately a small contact when I was in the car cost us some time today, but we learn from it and are still happy to be on the podium.” Philipp Eng, #55 BMW M4 GT3: “Again, every single lap in the BMW M4 GT3 was just a dream. It is so much fun to drive this car. We have been very consistent, the car handles the tyres well and is very good to drive, especially in traffic. Once again, it was great team work and I think we have a very strong package in the BMW M4 GT3. I am already looking forward to the next tasks with the car, and especially to next year when it will start in its first real racing season. Everyone at BMW M Motorsport has done an outstanding job. The development work was intensive, the right decisions have been made, and now we have a product that just works superbly and which you climb in and feel comfortable straight away.” Augusto Farfus, #55 BMW M4 GT3: “It was a great race. We managed to race the car close to the leaders. I think today we have seen that the car is very competitive and I think we can all be proud of what we have achieved. P5 today was a great achievement and somehow it feels like a little victory for us. It makes us confident that next year we can fight for proper victories. Now we focus on the next steps and thanks again to BMW M Motorsport for this opportunity to drive the car. It is real fun, and it is great to be behind the wheel.” \n"}

This made it possible to land safely with the trophy after two minutes of flying, despite a top speed of 230 km\/h, before it was driven in its case to the opening ceremony at Whistling Straits in the BMW Group’s fully-electric technology flagship, the BMW iX xDrive50*. The Ultimate Journey ended with Salzmann carrying the trophy onto the stage at the opening ceremony.“The Ryder Cup is of significant importance in the golfing and sporting world. This contest casts its spell over the competitors and teams, just as it does the enthusiastic spectators at the course and the many fans watching from the edge of their seats all over the world,” said Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand Communication and Brand Experience BMW Group. “To acknowledge the prominent position of this competition, and to celebrate the premiere of BMW as Worldwide Partner of the Ryder Cup, we wanted to make the arrival of the trophy particularly special. To do so, we created a unique case for the trophy, which is both innovative and representative.”The chief criterion when developing the trophy case was to protect the Ryder Cup during the stunt. At the same time, it had to guarantee the freedom to move for the wingsuit pilot, as well as optimal aerodynamic properties. Furthermore, it should be an emotive design, which continues to represent the status of the trophy and the event even after the stunt – the challenge was to create a product that is innovative, luxurious and inspiring, and thus reflects the spirit of BMW i. A challenge tailor-made for Designworks, the innovative engine of the BMW Group, with its expertise in bringing together the needs of mobility and other sectors.“When asked to work on this project connected to the historical Ryder Cup event it was something that excited me to be part of. We just knew it had to be a product that blends the BMW i excitement for technology with the prestigious and honourable aspects surrounding the event itself,” said Tommy Forsgren, Designworks Lead Designer. “The case design is a true innovative BMW i product – its premium qualities and exclusivity matching the new BMW iX in terms of colour and material finish.”The trophy case consists of an outer aluminium frame and a 3D printed space frame capsule with large gaps, allowing the Ryder Cup trophy to be seen, even when closed and during the flight. The case can be attached to the interior skeleton of the wingsuit just as quickly as it can to a wall – for example, for exhibition purposes. The opening mechanism is like that found on a wing door.The Ryder Cup is not the first project, on which BMW i, BMW Group Designworks and Peter Salzmann have collaborated. Together, they developed the ‘Electrified Wingsuit by BMW i’: an innovative, electric drive module and a wingsuit designed from scratch allowed Salzmann to fulfil his dream of developing his sport and breaking new ground with sophisticated drive technology.\n"}

Marco Wittmann (GER) celebrated his second win of the season on the sixth DTM race weekend. The two-time DTM champion delivered a sensational performance in a chaotic Saturday race at Assen, the ‘Cathedral of Speed’. Starting from second on the grid, he secured the win at the wheel of his #11 BMW M6 GT3 from the Walkenhorst Motorsport team, even overcoming a five-second penalty during the closing stage of the race. “My team and I decided to make our mandatory pit stop a little later,” said Wittmann. “That was a key moment, as the fresher tyres meant that we could attack the other cars in front of me. I gave it everything in that manoeuvre against Liam Lawson and risked the lot, a decision for which I was later penalised. It is a great feeling to be able to win despite this, and it is a fantastic team performance.” In the #31 BMW M6 GT3 from ROWE Racing, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) also scored points in sixth place, while team-mate Timo Glock (GER) was forced to retire in the #16 BMW M6 GT3. Wittmann gave another impressive performance on Sunday.

For BMW Motorrad Motorsport, Sunday’s action in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Barcelona (ESP) was overshadowed by a heavy crash involving Tom Sykes (GBR) in race two. The British rider was taken to hospital for further checks as a precaution after initial examinations at the Medical Centre revealed that he had suffered a concussion. His team-mate from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Michael van der Mark (NED), completed the second race in ninth position. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team crossed the line in 16th place. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had already endured some poor luck in the morning’s Superpole race. Van der Mark fell on the first lap, sending Sykes into the gravel trap. Both riders headed for the pits. After three laps, the race was suspended after another accident. However, according to the regulations, neither BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team rider was allowed to compete in the restart. The sprint race was shortened to five laps, with Folger finishing in 13th place. This meant P10 for Sykes, P13 for van der Mark and P18 for Folger on the grid for race two. At the beginning of the second race, Sykes fell and was then hit by another rider. Sykes was taken to the circuit’s medical centre, where initial diagnoses revealed a concussion. Further precautionary investigations have since taken place in a Barcelona hospital. The accident led to the suspension of the race, which restarted after a delay. Van der Mark crossed the line in ninth place. Folger secured 16th position. The WorldSBK now travels to Jerez de le Frontera in southern Spain, where the tenth round of the season will take place next weekend. Quotes after race two at Barcelona. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Our main concern is that Tom is well. He is conscious and in hospital for further checks at the moment. We have our fingers firmly crossed that he has come through the crash relatively unscathed. It was not an easy day. Unfortunately, Mickey also took out Tom when he crashed in this morning’s Superpole race. As they had already completed three laps by the time the red flag appeared, we were unfortunately unable to join in when the Superpole race re-started. In race two, Tom fell and was then unfortunately hit by another rider. Mickey was ninth in race two. They were probably difficult conditions for many riders, but that was obviously not the result we were striving for. It was a difficult end to a weekend that actually started very positively.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First of all, our thoughts are with Tom today. He has gone for further checks at Barcelona Hospital. He has been talking and is conscious which is a good sign so we will wait for further information, however this really casts a shadow over the whole day. In the Superpole race, both riders equally went down from an accident caused by Mickey, which he has sincerely apologized to the team for. In the second feature race, I think Mickey struggled to get his tyre to work for him very early in the race but come the final third, he had pace which was getting him where we expected him to be sort of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth position, but by that point it was too late, so it’s a scant reward for his weekend’s work in 9th position. Now we will draw a line under Catalunya 2021 and move forward to Jerez. But the main thing today is that we wish Tom a speedy recovery.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This morning in the Superpole race I made a mistake. I tried to overtake Tom, but I was too fast and crashed and pushed Tom into the gravel. It was a stupid mistake, so I am really sorry to the team. In race two, I got a reasonable start, but unfortunately the red flag was brought out because of Tom’s crash, from which I hope he is OK. At the restart I struggled with the bike; we didn’t have any stopping performance nor the grip I was aiming for, so it was a long and difficult race. We have to find out the reason why this is happening when the track conditions change. In the end we scored some points and next week we have another chance.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was a tough Sunday. We all had difficulties with the grip, but we are not able to get the rear chassis working the way we want it to. As a result, I had problems in the Superpole race and in race two. We will now take a close look at the data and then hopefully take a step forward in Jerez next weekend.” \n"}

Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Kenny Foray (FRA) had shared duties in the saddle of the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. After seven and a half hours of racing, the team was running in fourth position when Mikhalchik had issues with the power train and had to bring the bike back to the garage. Team Manager Werner Daemen’s squad tried everything to continue the race but then had to make the decision to retire. The cause of the issue will now be analysed in detail. Privateer BMW Team LRP Poland was lying in 18th overall and in sixth position in the EWC class with the #90 BMW S 1000 RR after 21 hours of racing. Tecmas BMW (#9 BMW S 1000 RR) had to retire after a crash. The 84th edition of the Bol d’Or was the third round of the FIM EWC 2021 season. The final round, the 8-hour race at Most in the Czech Republic, will be held on 9th October. Reactions. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “This obviously is a hard setback for us, also in regards of the title fight in the world championship. Another podium finish with a lot of championship points would have been possible in this 24-hour race but endurance racing once more proved that a lot can happen. Several top teams have run into issues in this very hard race, and unfortunately we have been one of them. We will now analyse in detail to find the exact cause of the issue. I want to thank the entire team and the riders for their very hard work before and at the race weekend. Now we are looking forward to the finale at Most. There, we want to attack again and fight at the very top.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It’s very sad, for the riders and our entire team who all worked so hard, but it can happen. We will leave that behind us and our full focus is now on the next round at Most.” Markus Reiterberger: “We of course are all very disappointed. The team tried everything to bring us back on track but unfortunately we had to retire. It is very sad that the Le Castellet weekend ended that way. But we will not get disheartened. Now, we will prepare for Most where we will come back in full strength.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “We did a good job during this week. We have again being always on top. In the race, we were running in P4, just ten seconds behind P3. Our pace was very strong, like the leading pace. Then we unfortunately suffered the technical issue. But okay, it is endurance, and it’s a technical sport. Let’s forget this situation, focus on the next one and prove that this team is capable of winning.” Kenny Foray: “For sure, it is very sad for us. I had high hopes in the race, but it is like it is. We gave our very best but this time it was not meant to be. It is difficult to find the words to explain what I feel. It is not easy, but this is racing and sometimes you win or are on the podium and sometimes you don’t finish.” \n"}

He was now battling for a podium finish and moved to within 0.1 seconds of the top three. When leader Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR \/ Yamaha) retired on the 15th lap, van der Mark was able to claim third for a while before dropping two places. Van der Mark then closed up on Jonathan Rea (GBR \/ Kawasaki) again during the final laps, before crossing the line in fifth place, six and a half seconds behind winner Scott Redding (GBR \/ Ducati). On lap one, Sykes moved up from 15th to tenth place. He then returned to the top eight on the next lap and completed the race in eighth position. Folger finished a difficult race in 19th position. Quotes after race one at Barcelona. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Overall, that was a mixed day for us. Of course, it was fantastic for Tom to get pole position in Superpole and we are also very pleased with Michael’s performance in the race having started from ninth and was then involved in the battle for the podium. Unfortunately, his tyres started to wear during the final laps. But he did cross the line just a few seconds off the podium places. This is good, and means we have one good race in the bag. Unfortunately, Tom had some bad luck at the start and wasn’t able to turn his pole position into a result. It was a shame that he fell back so far. Now we will see what the weather tomorrow brings. I will be heading on to Le Castellet where we are competing in the Bol d’Or with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. I wish this team the very best of luck as well, and we hope that regular rider Xavi Forés recovers from his injuries swiftly.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Firstly, it was a great Superpole lap from Tom. An unbelievable lap time. Mickey didn’t do so bad qualifying for the third row in ninth. In race one, Tom unfortunately fell back to P15 at the start. Mickey did well to break through from P9 and was almost in the podium position, but it’s days like today where we need to take our opportunity. We need to speak to the riders and get their feedback, but P5 and P8 isn’t such a bad result. But Tom starting from pole; he will be disappointed with that. Let’s see what tomorrow brings, hopefully we can go a bit better.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This morning in FP3 I felt really good. I had good pace after making some changes to the bike which I felt comfortable with. In Superpole I was quite happy with my laps. P9 on the grid wasn’t ideal, but I knew we had a good bike for the race. The race then was wet. I had an OK start and got into a good rhythm and started to pass people. At a certain point in the race I was feeling really confident but I felt the bike spinning as soon as I picked the bike up out of the corner, especially compared to the other riders. For me it was an enjoyable race but it was also really frustrating as I had the feeling that if I had a little more grip on the exit I could have been up there fighting for the podium. Anyway, this is another race done and we learnt a lot from it. We have to find the solution when it’s wet again to get more drive grip.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It obviously was great to get pole position in Superpole but then at the race start, I went from pole position to 15th. In the rainy conditions I got on a lot of paint on the track after half a metre so the bike spun up twice. It was unfortunate because in the early laps we had good speed and then everybody seemed to go quite flat so it was difficult to make the difference, so it was a disappointment but it is like it is. The bike was working very good in a lot of areas, just missing entry grip on the rear. This is something to look after for tomorrow and then we will get our next chance.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I had hoped that we would be able to benefit from the rain and move up by a few places. However, the opposite turned out to be the case. I don’t know why, but I had hardly any grip. Maybe it was because we did not use the chassis completely for rain setup. We will have to see what the others did but I think that this was the main reason why I had no grip, causing me to lose time lap after lap. Now I hope that it stays dry tomorrow. We had been doing well in the dry and maybe we will be able to score more points tomorrow.” \n"}

The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team will start the Bol d’Or in Le Castellet (FRA), which is the third round of the 2021 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), from third on the grid with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. Only the times of Markus Reiterberger (GER) and Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) were classified for qualifying, as the third regular rider, Xavi Forés (ESP), was unable to participate after picking up an injury in Thursday’s practice session in a crash that was not his fault. The team’s fourth rider, Kenny Foray (FRA) will alternate with Reiterberger and Mikhalchik in the race. Forés was hit and knocked off his bike by another rider in practice and injured his shoulder in the fall. As he was unable to start in the two qualifying sessions on Thursday and Friday, the grid position for the #37 M RR was calculated taking the average of the fastest times set by Reiterberger and Mikhalchik in their sessions. Reiterberger’s best time of 1:53.617 minutes came on Friday morning, as did Mikhalchik’s fastest lap of 1:53.623 minutes. This produced an average time of 1:53.620 minutes. The 84th Bol d’Or gets underway at 15:00 CEST on Saturday 18th September. The race finishes 24 hours later. The privateer BMW Team LRP Poland (#90 BMW S 1000 RR) starts from ninth place, with Tecmas BMW (#9 BMW S 1000 RR) 30th on the grid. Quotes after the Bol d’Or qualifying. Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “It has been a little bit mixed feelings, because on one side we have Xavi’s injury, but, in general, I am very happy with qualifying. As a team we are very strong. We did not use any qualifying engine, but the lap times from Markus, Ilya and especially Kenny, who is going to be our third rider in the race, were very good. I am very happy to see that Kenny has the same rhythm as the others and that he is in top form. Everything is well prepared and we are ready to fight for the top places.” Markus Reiterberger: “Third place on the grid is good, although I am not entirely satisfied with qualifying. I gave it my all, but was a little unlucky with slipstreams. That is an important factor here at this racetrack, especially when you are not on a bike in special qualifying trim. We will now sit down together and try to come up with the perfect package for the race. I think that all three of us – Ilya, Kenny and myself – are superbly-set in terms of our race pace. Unfortunately, Xavi cannot start. I wish him all the best and a speedy recovery. It is going to be a long and hard race, but we are ready.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am pretty happy with how the week has gone so far. I feel good on the bike, even if it it’s not 100 per cent perfect yet like it was at the test. We did not manage to put together the ideal lap as we did at the test with Markus. But it is good to start from P3 and we can rely on our strong race pace. We just need to have a trouble-free race. We hope for good weather so we can enjoy the riding during the 24-hours. So let’s see how it will go and let’s fight until the end.” Xavi Forés: “Obviously, it was a bit unexpected for me to finish the Bol d’Or weekend so early. It was a big shame to be taken out on track due to another rider’s mistake and to not be able to race this weekend. It also hurts especially as we are fighting for the victory and for the title. So it’s not only painful for my shoulder but also for my heart that I can’t help the team in that task. My target is now to try to recover as fast as I can to be ready and in a good shape for the season finale in Most. All the best to my team-mates and to the team for the race – I cross my fingers for them for another podium and more strong points for the championship.” Kenny Foray: “First of all, I am really sorry for Xavi. That was not the plan and I know that it is very difficult for him. I wish him a speedy recovery. I am ready for the race. I feel good on the bike, I love this race, I love this track and I love this bike. I will give my all and am confident that we can have a strong race.” \n"}
{"prompt":"For BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the action comes thick and fast over the next few weeks in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), with three race weekends in a row. First, this weekend (17th to 19th September), is the ninth event of the season at Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona (ESP). Rounds ten and eleven of the season will then take place at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) and Portimão (POR). ->","completion":" Munich. For BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the action comes thick and fast over the next few weeks in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), with three race weekends in a row. First, this weekend . Circuit de Catalunya hosted WorldSBK for the first time last year. This spring, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Bonovo MGM Racing completed extensive tests at Jerez de la Frontera and Barcelona, where they prepared their BMW M 1000 RRs for the season ahead. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Sykes also attended another Barcelona test in hot conditions this August. Jerez de la Frontera, where round ten of this season’s WorldSBK will take place from 24th to 26th September, has been a fixture on the calendar for many years. The same goes for Portimão on the Portuguese Algarve, venue for the eleventh event of the season from 1st to 3rd October. The triple being held in Spain and Portugal marks the end of the European leg of WorldSBK for BMW Motorrad Motorsport, before the series moves on to the two overseas events in Argentina and Indonesia in October and November. Quotes ahead of the WorldSBK triple header. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Some intensive weeks await us in WorldSBK. With three back-to-back race weekends, we have a demanding programme ahead of us. However, we are looking forward to the challenge. Barcelona may still be a relatively new hunting ground in WorldSBK, but we were already able to gather important information there during this year’s tests to have a good base. It was also helpful to get out on the track there in summery conditions in August as we have to expect high temperatures at the next races, especially at Jerez de la Frontera and Portimão. Our goal is to get the triple-header off to a strong start with our M RRs in Barcelona, then to carry the momentum into the remaining races in the south of the Iberian Peninsula.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “At Magny-Cours, the two sides of the garage had different issues but all are working to overcome that. The aim for the next race at Barcelona and the coming triple-header is to build on our test work that we did there in pre-season and recently with Tom also. We are confident we can once again hit the ground running in FP1 with a very good pace. We know that we can be competitive at Catalunya, we have proved that in the past. The temperatures will be pretty high and we know we need to manage that with the bike. Overall, we are keen to be back on track again; it is going to be very hectic and very hard work for the mechanics and the entire team working on three back-to-back races so we need to plan our work very efficiently and we prepare ourselves. I think it will be once again critical that we start FP1 and FP2 and go into qualifying with a very good pace and give ourselves a real chance in the races by qualifying on the front two rows where possible and we are hopeful that we can do that.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am really looking forward to the next three rounds of the World Superbike Championship. To be honest, it’s a little bit different approach now; I don’t remember in all of my years racing that we had three back-to-back races so that’s definitely a quite intense part of the championship. It will be three exciting circuits and ones that I really enjoy so starting in Catalunya we can hopefully find a little bit more form and continue the run that we had there the last time we visited. Plus we also had a test there recently to get some more information so I am overall looking forward to the run of these three races and trying to gain many more points for the championship.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I always love to ride my race bike and I think we can be still very happy that we can do so many races this year so I am looking forward to the triple-header. In addition, we are going to three of my favourite race tracks in a row, so that’s also not so bad. We tested at Barcelona in spring and it is good to come there again and see where we improved. I think that we have shown at Magny-Cours that we are getting closer to the podium. Of course, I want to fight for the podium and we are getting closer. At Magny-Cours, we were unlucky with a few things but our goal for sure is to fight again for these positions. I think the general package has improved and our goal is to fight for the podium on the coming weekends.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Firstly, I am looking forward to Barcelona, as we had a good test there in the spring. We are now looking to implement some of that at the race weekend and adapt one or two of the settings. It is also a great circuit which really suits me. I hope I can make the most of that and that we can score a good haul of points. We attended our very first test with BMW at Jerez de la Frontera, and I know the track just as well as I do the Barcelona circuit because I have ridden there many times in the past. I am obviously hoping that we continue to see an upward trend there and can pick up some points. In contrast, Portimão is new territory for me. I don’t know the circuit. I have watched many videos of MotoGP and the Superbike World Championship, and it appears to be a very demanding circuit, which is often referred to as ‘rollercoaster’. However, I am really looking forward to this new challenge and am already very excited about the ‘rollercoaster ride’ at Portimão.” Track Facts Barcelona.Circuit length4.627 km – clockwiseCorners14 – 8 right-handers, 6 left-handersPole positionLeftLongest straight900 metresGrip levelMedium \/ lowTrack layoutVery long straight, flowing sectionsStrain on brakesMediumAmount at full throttle27 %Top speed \/ lowest speed312 km\/h \/ 58 km\/hBest overtaking opportunityT1Key factorsTraction, engine performance Track Facts Jerez de la Frontera.Circuit length4.432 km – clockwiseCorners13 – 8 right-handers, 5 left-handersPole positionLeftLongest straight580 metresGrip levelMediumTrack layoutPartly long corner, hard braking zonesStrain on brakesMedium \/ highAmount at full throttle25 %Top speed \/ lowest speed283 km\/h \/ 59 km\/hBest overtaking opportunityT1, T6, T13Key factorsGood delay, agility Track Facts Portimão.Circuit length4.592 km – clockwiseCorners15 – 9 right-handers, 6 left-handersPole positionLeftLongest straight770 metresGrip levelMediumTrack layoutSignificant changes in elevation, more slower sections but also fast corners with compressionStrain on brakesMedium \/ lowAmount at full throttle20 %Top speed \/ lowest speed308 km\/h \/ 52 km\/hBest overtaking opportunityT5Key factorsStability, confidence in the front, good turn-in \n"}

In race two on Sunday, the duo produced a drive worthy of champions to win the title. With torrential rain causing perilous conditions, Burton and Burns took their third victory of the season. That was enough to give them an unassailable lead in the Drivers’ Championship as well as in the Silver category. Century Motorsport was also crowned champion in the Team competition with races to spare. “To be GT4 champions is just incredible. What a weekend,” said Burns. Burton added: “Century have done such a superb job with the car. It felt great, even in conditions like those. And the strategy has been spot-on all season.

After six hours of racing, they claimed the second spot on the podium. The new BMW M4 GT3 also made its debut at the seventh NLS race, driven by Philipp Eng (AUT) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). The BMW Juniors secured fifth position on the grid in Saturday morning’s qualifying session. A great, error-free performance from all three drivers swiftly put the trio on course for the podium as they battled for another win. They also set the fastest race lap with the #44 BMW M6 GT3. Hesse, Harper and Verhagen finished second to secure another podium, crossing the line less than 20 seconds behind the victorious Manthey Porsche. The new BMW M4 GT3, which is still in the test and development phase, made a racing debut out of competition in the SP-X prototype class. Cars in this class have to start at the back of the GT3 field, regardless of their result in qualifying. Farfus and Eng then worked their way up into the top ten with the #55 BMW M4 GT3. Running the tank to empty was part of the planning for the day, and the car then rolled to a stop at the entry to the pit lane once the fuel ran out in the final minutes. The #35 BMW M6 GT3 from Walkenhorst Motorsport also recorded a top six finish. Jörg Müller, Mario von Bohlen, Dennis Fetzer (all GER) and Thomas Neubauer (FRA) finished in sixth position. Starting from tenth on the grid, David Pittard (GBR) sprinted up to second in the #34 Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M6 GT3, before a double dose of tyre damage knocked him and his team-mates Christian Krognes (NOR) and Ben Tuck (GBR) a long way back. The team’s #36 BMW M6 GT3, driven by Henry Walkenhorst, Jörg Breuer and Andreas Ziegler (all GER), crossed the line in 14th place overall, and in second place in the SP9 AM class. This was a first taste of the Nordschleife for Jake Dennis (GBR). Having finished third in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship 2021, he had made his GT racing debut for BMW M Motorsport last weekend in the Fanatec GT World Challenge Endurance Cup and is now aiming for his Nordschleife permit. In the seventh NLS race, Dennis shared driving duties with Niklas Krütten (GER) in the #652 BMW M240i Racing from the Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive. The duo claimed second place in the BMW M240i class. Reactions after round seven of the 2021 NLS. Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “We had a successful day all round on the Nordschleife. Congratulations to our three BMW Juniors Max, Dan and Neil – they battled for their next NLS win right up to the final lap in their BMW M6 GT3 and can be very satisfied with second place. The three gave an error-free performance, delivering impressive proof that they are certainly one of the real top teams on the Nordschleife. Our new BMW M4 GT3 also enjoyed a successful race debut. The car ran like clockwork and we had no problems at all during yesterday’s testing or in qualifying and the race today. Augusto and Philipp were delighted with the performance of the BMW M4 GT3 and confirmed how great the BMW M4 GT3 drives on the Nordschleife. Overall, we are very pleased with this NLS Saturday.” Max Hesse, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “It was a good six-hour race for us. The team gave a top performance and it was very, very close at the end. Of course, it was a bit of a shame that we didn’t quite manage to grab the win but we will try to do that again in two weeks. To be honest, the Manthey guys are really strong here at the Nordschleife. The drivers are the reigning champions in the 24-hour race and so we can really pleased to have kept the gap to below 20 seconds after a six-hour race.” Neil Verhagen, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “When you are so close to the win, it is obviously a bit bitter-sweet but I think we can be super happy with today. BMW Team RMG, Max and Dan and myself, I think we all achieved pretty much the maximum that we could today. We knew that we really need to put everything together to be competitive and that is exactly what we did. So I am super happy with the team and with my team-mates. Thank you to BMW and to everybody involved to make this possible because it was definitely not easy. We fought over the entire race and it was just down to the wire. Now we keep pushing to return to the top step.” Dan Harper, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “Overall, I am very happy with the result. Obviously on the back of two wins, the second place and even being so close to first place, can be a bit disappointing but we can for sure be very happy. The team and us three drivers we have done a good job, we achieved the maximum that was possible and collected good points for the championship. And it is always nice to spray some champagne.” Philipp Eng, #55 BMW M4 GT3: “That was so much fun. It was an honour for me to complete the debut race for the BMW M4 GT3 together with Augusto. The car drives extremely well. If you compare it with the BMW M6 GT3, it is even easier to drive but the performance is even better. The Nordschleife was a busy place again today and I had a few situations with other cars but it helped that you can overtake offline with the BMW M4 GT3 too, without getting yourself into trouble right away. Overall, I feel that it went great. The race was smooth and I would be happy to start the 24-hour race with this car right away.” Augusto Farfus, #55 BMW M4 GT3: “It was a very emotional day because I remember my first rollout in Dingolfing and after so many months, we come to the Nordschleife and I did the first race start with the new BMW M4 GT3. It was just great. Thanks to BMW who did an amazing job, the car ran trouble-free. We could experience and measure the speed of the car against the competition so it was a great lesson today. The car feels very, very good and I can’t wait to be back at the Nordschleife with the car.” Jake Dennis, #652 BMW M240i Racing: “It was fantastic to finally experience the Nordschleife. It certainly lived up to my expectations. Everybody had warned me how difficult it is and entire circuit is just impressive. There is not really one combination what makes it superior to any other, it is just 25 kilometres of challenge. It is so on the edge and when the conditions are mixed as well, as we had them in this morning’s qualifying, it makes life even more challenging. But that’s part of the Nordschleife and that’s what makes it so special. It has been a great experience and the BMW M240i Racing is a great car to learn the circuit. And to finish second in the class was obviously very nice.” \n"}

The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is all set for the next classic in the 2021 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC). The 24-hour Bol d’Or on 18th\/19th September at Circuit Paul Ricard in Le Castellet (FRA) is round three of the 2021 FIM EWC season. Alternating in the saddle of the #37 BMW M 1000 RR will once again be Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Xavi Forés (ESP). Kenny Foray (FRA) is also in Le Castellet as the team’s fourth rider. In preparation for the famous endurance race, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team attended a two-day test in Le Castellet last week. The team, led by team principal Werner Daemen, and the four riders fine-tuned the set-up of the #37 M RR, ready to take on the challenges of the 24-hour race. The test was a successful one and the team set the fastest time on both days – with a new lap record on each occasion. On Tuesday, Mikhalchik topped the standings with a new record of 1:53.261 minutes on the #37 bike. Reiterberger then went even faster on the Wednesday, setting a new record of 1:52.484 minutes. The last time the Bol d’Or took place, in September 2019, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team was making its debut in the FIM EWC. Back then the team finished third with the #37 BMW S 1000 RR to claim a spot on the podium at the first attempt. The team has also finished third on the new #37 BMW M 1000 RR in each of the two races that have been held so far in the 2021 season – the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) and the 12 Hours of Estoril (POR). The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team lies third in the world championship with 80 points, seven less than the leaders. The race weekend in Le Castellet kicks off on Wednesday 15th September with scrutineering. This is followed on Thursday 16th September by the first practice and qualifying sessions. On Tuesday 14th September, another private test day will be held. As well as the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, the privateer BMW teams Tecmas BMW 9 (#9 BMW S 1000 RR), Team univers racing\/ACRacing #23 (#23 BMW S 1000 RR) and LRP Poland (#90 BMW S 1000 RR) also compete in the Bol d’Or. Quotes ahead of the Bol d’Or. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The Bol d’Or is one of the biggest classics in motorcycle racing. Our debut in the FIM EWC in Le Castellet two years ago was unforgettable. Finishing on the podium at the first attempt was very special. Since then, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team has proven that this success was no flash in the pan. It has established itself among the world’s elite, first with the BMW S 1000 RR and now with the BMW M 1000 RR. Last week’s test was very promising and gives us momentum ahead of the race weekend. However, we know that nothing is guaranteed in an endurance race, and that is particularly true of 24-hour races. Our goal is to impress with a strong performance at the Bol d’Or. The ingredients are there to achieve that: a superbly coordinated and experienced team, an extremely competitive motorbike, and strong, fast and experienced riders. We are well equipped to face the challenges of the Bol d’Or. If everything goes to plan in the race, we can continue the success story of the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The test last week was really good. We still had some small issues, but this is normal. The team found a good set-up; we have been the fastest on both days, we broke the lap record on both days, and this with two different riders, which is also important. All four riders did a very good job. Kenny, of course, who knows the track very well, and then Xavi, who was there for the first time, was really fast and showed his potential with good lap times. Also Ilya and Markus were fast as always and concentrated. I think we are well prepared for the race. Of course, a 24-hour race is a 24-hour race, but we are confident we can show another strong performance at this year’s Bol d’Or.” Markus Reiterberger: “On the first day of the test I first had to refamiliarise myself with the circuit, as the last time I was here was back in 2015 and there have been a few changes since then. However, I adapted really quickly and set the second fastest time behind my team-mate Ilya, who set a new record. We had good pace, but still tried out a few things on the bike. On the second day I was really happy with my race pace and the long runs. I was super quick and consistent. At the end of day two I also set a new record. To have ridden the fastest lap ever on a motorcycle in Le Castellet is very cool. However, what is far more important is the race pace, and we are excellently positioned with our bike in that sense. We will now fine-tune our package a bit between now and the race. Our goal for the race is to win. The podium is the least we are aiming for, victory would be fantastic. We have the package to achieve it, the team will do a superb job of preparing the bike, and we are really well positioned with our trio of riders and our fast fourth rider. I am looking forward to the Bol d’Or.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “Last week we had a really positive test. We have been really fast and set two lap records. Our pace was very strong during the long stints. We also tried a few tyres for the race but also for the fast lap. I am confident that we are ready to fight for the top positions. Me personally, I tried a lot of things, especially on day two, and several settings on the bike. I had a very good feeling for the bike, and it worked very well on new as well as on used tyres. This is really important for the endurance race. I am very happy and looking forward to the race.” Xavi Forés: “It was a very positive test for me. I was there only for one day, as I had to go back to the UK for the British Superbike Championship. It was an amazing day for me as I could learn the layout of the track as I had never been there before. I really enjoyed riding there; I was fast and consistent as well on my laps. I did a long stint trying to stay focused on the race pace and I think we did quite well. So I am looking forward to the race. It is going to be a very important race for us because we are fighting for the championship. It will be a very long race. We have to stay very focused and make no mistakes. If we can do that, I think we have the pace and are strong enough to fight for the victory. I can’t wait to start and see what the race weekend brings.” Kenny Foray: “It was a really good test for us. The race pace of the bike was great for all of us four riders. This is good for the race. Of course, you can never know what happens in the race because it goes over 24 hours, but I think that we are ready.” \n"}

Ever since the brand was born in 1959, MINI has been all about doing more with less and finding the most creative ways to use space. The current campaign being run by the British premium brand goes one step further. #BIGLOVE is an expression of diversity embraced in practice in all its forms, welcoming fresh thinking and new ideas no matter where they come from. At the IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich, the MINI brand presented its path towards more sustainable mobility and an inclusive future for everyone based on the claim “We’re all different, but pretty good together”.For the duration of the trade fair, under the motto “BIG LOVE from Munich”, MINI contributed to the revitalisation of the vibrant industrial site in the suburbs of Munich called “Sugar Mountain”, which focuses on creativity, sport, personal fulfilment and community. The site of the former concrete factory is now enhanced by a multi-coloured mural on an old tower, designed by London-based artist Lakwena Maciver especially for the occasion. Lakwena’s artistic style thrives on bold statements and bright colours. Her aim is to make art accessible to everyone. This is why she mainly paints in public spaces, bringing art to people who might otherwise not have access to it. This approach makes her the perfect partner for MINI, conveyed in the messages that appear in her colourful mural with the words “DIFFERENT BUT GOOD TOGETHER” and “BIG LOVE”. The installation will continue to embellish the district of Obersendling in Munich after the IAA Mobility 2021 is over.Sugar Mountain represented the kick-off of MINI’s IAA “Big love from Munich” campaign with MINI friends taking part in a wide range of activities here. Exciting matches on the World Club Tennis Court, high-speed races on the BMX pump track and laid-back tricks on the Jam Skate Park – they had plenty of space to spontaneously engage in sports or express their own personal style. There was also the opportunity to improve their DJ skills at a DJ set master class, with the sound of relaxed beats providing the perfect background for people to meet and relax in the spacious community area.Furthermore, adventurers and outdoor lovers alike experienced an urban campsite with the AUTOHOME special edition roof tents for the MINI Countryman. The roof tents, produced for the first time with recycled materials, are made with bottles collected from the ocean and fully match the brand’s design and the MINI pioneering spirit, where every day offers new sustainable adventures and perspectives.MINI’s IAA BIG LOVE campaign continued in the MINI Pavillon at Lenbachplatz in Munich where visitors were able to take part in a variety of activities from culinary to sport. With displays created by British fashion designer Paul Smith, the MINI Pavilion was also transformed into a fascinating and versatile hotspot for fresh ideas. The MINI STRIP, a custom-made one-off car by Paul Smith in collaboration with MINI, presented here focused on the topics of sustainability and innovation for increased environmental protection. The MINI STRIP shines the spotlight on an innovative approach to the issue of sustainability in automotive manufacturing. Guided by the overarching theme of ‘Simplicity, Transparency, Sustainability’, the car showcases inspirational ideas for a more sustainable method of automotive design.Visitors also had the opportunity to find out about the future design of individual mobility and urban living spaces through displays and panel discussions involving designers and visionaries from the creative tech start-ups that are being supported in connection with the MINI Start-up Accelerator URBAN-X. The ideas presented were then debated live with thought leaders from the dialogue platform “The Sooner Now” under the motto “The city of tomorrow is made today”.This dialogue between visionaries and the MINI community during the IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich was thus entirely dedicated to the crucial issues of our time facing MINI: urban mobility, sustainability, cosmopolitanism and individuality. In this way, the future-oriented brand was able to leave behind positive stimuli and a feeling that lasts – #BIGLOVE. \n"}

{"prompt":"The BMW Group is putting circular economy and sustainable urban mobility at the centre of its presence at the 2021 IAA Mobility. At the motor show, the company is consistently demonstrating its sustainability and CO2 targets as well as its concrete measures and concepts to achieve these goals. ->","completion":"  Munich. The BMW Group is putting circular economy and sustainable urban mobility at the centre of its presence at the 2021 IAA Mobility. At the motor show, the company is consistently demonstrating its sustainability and CO2 targets as well as its concrete measures and concepts to achieve these goals. More stringent CO2 targets and consistent focus on a circular economyThe BMW Group is increasing the pace of its efforts to combat climate change. Looking ahead to the introduction of the Neue Klasse, the company is further strengthening its self-defined objectives, announced in summer last year, to significantly reduce CO2 emissions, whilst also committing itself to a clear course that supports the 1.5 degree target for the limitation of global warming. The Neue Klasse will also see the BMW Group hugely increase its use of secondary materials with a firm focus on the principles of the circular economy, whilst also promoting better framework conditions for establishing a market for secondary materials. To achieve a further reduction in CO2 emissions, the focus is on the utilisation phase of vehicles, which account for 70% of the BMW Group’s CO2 footprint. By 2030, the CO2 emissions per vehicle and kilometre driven will be at least halved from 2019 levels. The commitment of all manufacturers when it comes to combatting climate change can best be compared when looking at the entire life cycle of a vehicle, including production and upstream supply chain. Here, the BMW Group is planning a reduction of CO2 emission per vehicle of at least 40%. “How companies are dealing with CO2 emissions has become a major factor when it comes to judging corporate action. The decisive factor in the fight against global warming is how strongly we can improve the carbon footprint of vehicles over their entire life span. This is why we are setting ourselves transparent and ambitious goals for the substantial reduction of CO2 emissions; these are validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative and will deliver an effective and measurable contribution,” said OliverZipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, in Munich on Thursday. “With the Neue Klasse we are significantly sharpening our commitment and also committing ourselves to a clear course for achieving the 1.5 degree target.” The most powerful driver on this path to climate neutrality is electric mobility, with the BMW Group’s Neue Klasse set to provide significant further momentum to the market. During the next ten years or so, the company will be putting around ten million all-electric vehicles on the road. As early as 2030, at least half of global BMW Group sales will be all-electric vehicles, with the MINI brand offering exclusively all-electric vehicles from 2030. Against this background, the BMW Group has also almost doubled the delivery volume for battery cells – a volume of EUR 22.36 billion has been agreed with the relevant suppliers for the fifth generation of the BMW electric drive. BMW i4 and iX as drivers for promoting e-mobility at the IAA MobilityWith the BMW iX and the BMW i4, two important core models of this electric offensive are introduced to the general public for the first time on the occasion of the 2021 IAA Mobility. The BMW iX, the new technological flagship of the BMW Group, is a spearhead in the areas of electromobility and digitisation. BMW eDrive technology of the fifth generation enables locally emission-free driving pleasure with electric four-wheel drive and an extended range. With the BMW i4, all-electric mobility is now available for the first time in a premium mid-range model. Electric mobility has reached the core of the BMW brand. The BMW i4 combines locally emission-free driving pleasure in a particularly sporty style with ample space and the practicality of a four-door Gran Coupe. Fully electric versions of the high-volume BMW 5 Series and the BMW X1 will follow in the years to come. The same is true for the BMW 7 Series and the successor of the MINI Countryman. In 2023, the BMW Group will have at least one fully electric model on the road in around 90% of its current market segments. BMW Motorrad is also consistently pursuing an electromobility strategy for metropolitan areas. The BMW CE 04, also presented at the 2021 IAA Mobility, ensures sustainable driving pleasure on two wheels . With its electric drive, future-oriented design and innovative connectivity solutions, the new scooter combines the functions of mobility and communication. CO2 reduction through circular economy: BMW i Vision Circular shows enormous potentialHowever, climate friendly mobility is not automatically created through a higher number of electric vehicles on the road. Furthermore, it is crucial to reduce the use of primary material and the related environmentally harmful exploitation of resources and their often CO2-intensive processing – especially when it comes to car manufacturing, one of the most resource-intensive industries. As part of its holistic approach to sustainability, the BMW Group aims to increase significantly the percentage of secondary materials in its vehicles. On average, current vehicles are manufactured using almost 30 percent recycled and reusable materials. With the ‘Secondary First’ approach, BMW Group plans to successively raise this figure to 50 percent. With the BMW i Vision Circular, the BMW Group is demonstrating the consistent design of a car according to the principles of a circular economy. The overall design goal of this visionary vehicle was to create a vehicle that is optimized for closed material cycles and achieves a rate of 100% recycled materials or 100% recyclability. In addition to bio-based and certified raw materials, materials that have already passed through a product life cycle – so-called secondary materials – are used for this purpose. This also applies to the energy storage system: The solid-state battery of the BMW i Vision Circular is 100% recyclable and almost completely made from recycled materials. At the same time, it will achieve a considerably higher energy density with significantly fewer of the most valuable resources. “We have included circularity in our concept right from the start when designing the BMW i Vision Circular. That's why this visionary vehicle is full of innovative ideas that combine sustainability with new and inspiring aesthetics – we call this approach Circular Design,” explains Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design. Circular Design is based on the four principles RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE and RE:CYCLE. Four additional groundbreaking concepts for sustainable urban mobilityUnder the umbrella of electric mobility, digitisation and sustainability, the BMW Group will be presenting four additional groundbreaking concepts for a versatile and sustainable mobility mix on two and four wheels at the 2021 IAA Mobility – in addition to the BMW i Vision Circular. With the BMW i Vision AMBY, the first high-speed pedelec, the company is presenting a visionary two-wheel solution for urban mobility of tomorrow. From the outside, the BMW i Vision AMBY resembles an e-bike, but offers significantly more possibilities. The electric drive system comprises three speed stages for different road types: Up to 25 km\/h for use on cycle paths, up to 45 km\/h on inner-city roads and up to 60 km\/h maximum speed on multi-lane roads and out-of-town. The speed modes available to the rider are stored on a smartphone app. Manual selection of the speed level is conceivable, as is the automatic detection of position and road type by means of geofencing technology and the associated automatic adjustment of the maximum speed. The BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY has a similar approach, combining the benefits of a motorcycle with those of a bicycle. It is an extremely emotional, electric mobility concept for clever mobility in and out of the city combined with maximum flexibility. Through an automated speed limitation system, thanks to innovative geofencing technology, the rider can also travel on roads (up to 60 km\/h) as well as on bicycle paths (up to 25 km\/h). Unlike the BMW i Vision AMBY, the BMW Motorrad Vision AMBY accelerates using a throttle grip and has typical motorcycle footrests instead of pedals. As a legal framework for such vehicles with a modular speed concept does not yet exist, the AMBY visionary vehicles are meant to provide stimulus for such legislation to come into effect. BMW Motorrad is represented with another concept at the 2021 IAA Mobility – the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02. This is neither a classic motorcycle nor a scooter, but a completely new mobility offer. It is an easily accessible, electric two-wheeler for those aged 16 and above who want to be mobile and independent. The emphasis is on fresh looks, ease of use and plenty of emotions. MINI Vision Urbanaut as a space concept for the mobility of the futureThe main attraction of the MINI brand at the IAA is the MINI Vision Urbanaut, an innovative and fully electric vision of space for the mobility of the future. Here, typical MINI characteristics are translated into the future of mobility and given an individual interpretation. The MINI Vision Urbanaut is the epitome of \"clever use of space\" and a response to the needs of future cities and lifestyles. The interior, in particular, is completely new in design and uses sustainable materials such as cork for the floor and steering wheel or recycled fabrics for the seats. The reduction of components and the absence of leather and chrome underline the sustainability of the visionary concept. \n"}

Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team came home 18th and 16th. Sunday at Magny-Cours began with the warm-up in the morning, in which Sykes, van der Mark and Folger were fourth, ninth and 15th fastest. That was followed by the Superpole race. After a strong qualifying, Sykes again started from third on the grid, with van der Mark ninth and Folger 19th. Sykes initially established his position in the leading group at the start of the Superpole race, however fell back to eleventh place on lap two. Van der Mark gradually worked his way through the field and was running fifth at the halfway point, before dropping a position. The Dutchman ended the ten-lap sprint in sixth place, which put him on the second row of the grid for race two on Sunday afternoon. Sykes came home twelfth, which earned him tenth place on the grid for the second race. Folger finished 18th in the Superpole race. Folger was promoted one position from 19th to 18th on the grid for race two, as another rider was unable to start the race. Van der Mark made a strong start to race two and found himself in fourth place for a brief spell but dropped back to sixth place on lap six when he was touched by a rival whilst battling for fourth place, the Dutchman just able to avoid crashing. He showed great fighting spirit to battle back towards the front of the field, but was no longer able to attack in the second half of the race. Van der Mark dropped back to eighth place, a position he held on to through to the finish. Sykes endured a difficult start, after which he was lagging in 18th place. However, he fought his way back to 14th on the opening lap. By the end of lap seven, he was running in tenth place – a position he maintained through to the end of the 21-lap race. Folger also made a poor start, but improved in the second half of the race and took the chequered flag in 16th place. Quotes after race two at Magny-Cours. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Tom’s had a really tough day to be honest. He’s not got into his rhythm and got beat up a bit in both races and lost places. We know the top ten are so close together and I don’t think Tom has had a fair crack at it today so he will be disappointed with his performance. Mickey had a good Superpole race. I think he did really good to come through there, he had a good battle so to start the feature race from sixth position was a really good step. It was a strange race really. He got away really well and was in a tough battle with the front guys. Then Andrea Locatelli made a hard but fair move on Michael but it looks like the brake guard did its job and saved him from what could have been a major accident because the gyroscopic effect of the bike pulled Andrea back into the side of Mickey and he had nowhere to go so it was very lucky. But he fought back and used a lot of tyre which towards the end left him with no grip so eighth position is all we could do today. A good race overall from Mickey and I think we can come away from Magny-Cours with some positives. We have tested at Catalunya, so we are looking forward to going there next.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This morning’s Superpole race was alright. I had good pace and had a good feeling with the bike. I was just missing one or two tenths to stay with Scott Redding and fight for fourth place. I was confident going into the main race and had a strong start but then I started to struggle after a few laps. I had some moments with a few riders and lost a lot of time there but at the moment, the package is just not good enough to fight every corner with the other guys. In some corners we are losing too much time.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was difficult today. Put me on a clear track and I can go front row, put me on a clear track again in warm up and we can be consistently in the top four. We just cannot ride with the others. Unfortunately, when I’m with the other riders it becomes a lot more stop and start and we can’t follow them when it comes to opening the gas. As soon as I got clear track my lap times came down and were not too far from the fifth position in terms of lap time, but we can’t bridge the gap at this level. There’s a lot of information to be looked at, I will see with the team where we can improve.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I struggled in the races when the tank was full, particularly on the opening laps. I was not able to hold my line in the corners, which meant I could not go on the attack. The final third of each race was better – that was the best section of the race for me. We must now find out why we have these difficulties with the full tank. I will also see what I can do differently as a rider, to ensure that I get the BMW moving better. On the whole, it was another tough weekend for us. We will now analyse everything and I will take a close look to see what I, personally, can do better. Hopefully things will go our way at the next race weekend at Barcelona.” \n"}

Jeff Koons, together with Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management, BMW AG, announced today that the artist will create a special edition of the M850i xDrive Gran Coupe. The luxurious 8 Series Gran Coupe will be for sale in a very limited collector’s edition after its world premiere at Frieze Los Angeles in February 2022. In 2010, the American artist already created a unique BMW M3 GT2 Art Car which performed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. That same year, the rock singer Bono from U2 wrote in an editorial for the New York Times that Jeff Koons should have a part in designing the car of the future. BMW and Koons continued the conversation and are now proud to announce their latest collaboration at the invitation of Angelika Nollert, director of Neue Sammlung – The Design Museum, in Munich’s Pinakothek der Moderne. Jeff Koons, Artist: “I am really thrilled and honoured about the opportunity to work with BMW again and to create a special edition car. I was thinking very intensely about it: What is the essence of the 8 Series Gran Coupe? What is the essence of power? How to create something that exemplifies all the energy of the BMW 8 Series that is also able to touch upon the human element? Again, it’s just a wonderful opportunity to be working as part of the BMW family again.”“I am very proud to announce a new partnership with Jeff Koons. And let me say: I love what he has come up with! The 8 Series Gran Coupe is very close to our hearts and Jeff’s design of the car is full of joy and passion. Ever since we relaunched our collaboration, Jeff has said that he’s proud to be back with the BMW family. Dozens of engineers and designers have given their all to celebrate our partnership and make his vision come true. Welcome home, Jeff Koons!” said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management, BMW AG.Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design: “In 2021, we celebrate 50 years of cultural engagement worldwide. We just love the arts and the bold voices of our time. Our passion is emotion and to be able to work closely with Jeff Koons again has been an extraordinary source of inspiration. What better artist to collaborate with on the 8 Series Gran Coupe? Car Design takes inspiration from Art and Engineering and turns that into highly emotional experiences. Working with Jeff Koons again to jointly create something truly special is a great pleasure. He is one of the greatest artists of our time and one of the most inspiring and engaging human beings to work with.”Currently the cars are being produced in secret at the BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, Bavaria. During an exclusive evening event at Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich’s major museum of contemporary art and a few days prior to the opening of the IAA MOBILITY 2021, Jeff Koons and Oliver Zipse revealed first glimpses and close-up details of the artist’s 8 Series Gran Coupe.THE 8 X JEFF KOONS is the embodiment of precision, refinement and craftmenship, with a multi-layer paint taking 285 hours to apply onto each car. The expressive and striking design combines eleven different exterior colors ranging from blue to silver as well as from yellow to black. Only two cars will be produced each week. The multi-colored interior is comprised of high-end materials, fine leather and a cupholder lid with an edition badging and the artist’s engraved signature. The seats are made up of the striking red and blue colors of the company’s high-performance unit BMW M. Overall, the energetic and powerful design includes both elements of pop art as well as geometric patterns paying homage to the sporty 8 Series Gran Coupe’s intricate contours and shape.The BMW 850i was the first model of the 8 Series launched in 1990 and was celebrated as creating a new perspective of progress in advanced motoring, appealing to the connoisseur who acknowledges elegance and performance as the ultimate blend of perfection. In February 2022, BMW will present the special edition by Jeff Koons. On the occasion of the announcement in Munich, the artist’s very own Art Car as well as those by Alexander Calder, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, John Baldessari and Esther Mahlangu are on display at the Pinakothek der Moderne, showcasing the great legacy of BMW’s worldwide commitment to the arts for half a century.\n"}

The FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) is at Magny-Cours (FRA) this weekend for round eight of the 2021 season. In Superpole on Saturday morning, Tom Sykes (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished third to secure another place on the front row of the grid on his BMW M 1000 RR. In the afternoon’s opening race, his team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) finished fifth, while Sykes crossed the finish line in ninth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing Team came home 16th. Sykes was once again one of the top riders in Superpole qualifying. The Brit briefly topped the timings, and eventually secured third place and a spot on the front row of the grid with a time of 1:35.919 minutes. Van der Mark, who was unable to take to the track in the morning’s third free practice session due to a technical issue qualified ninth. Folger was 19th in qualifying. The air temperature rose to 26 degrees Celsius for the start of the race in the afternoon, resulting in a track temperature of 40 degrees Celsius. Starting third, Sykes dropped several positions at the start, while van der Mark climbed into sixth place before falling back to ninth again. On lap three, Sykes went very wide in turn five and slotted back into the field in twelfth place. Meanwhile, van der Mark had improved to seventh and soon took sixth place. The Dutchman remained in that position until lap 17 of 21, when Alex Lowes (GBR \/ Kawasaki) crashed in front of him, handing van der Mark fifth place – a position he retained through to the finish. Sykes was involved in a number of battles throughout the whole race in a fiercely-competitive group of riders. After 21 laps of racing, he crossed the finish line ninth. Folger initially dropped back at the start, but made some progress through the field in the second half of the race to finish 16th. Quotes after race one at Magny-Cours. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Tom did a great job in Superpole, and we know he can do that. His lap wasn’t a clean lap either so he was a bit disappointed not to get pole, but happy with a front row start. Tom’s race was bit disappointing for him; he had the pace to be with Michael, but he was getting beaten up and pushed about a bit which disrupted his rhythm, so he is not happy with ninth position. Mickey had a really difficult day. We had a technical issue this morning and lost a lot of time which was valuable for us. So, to qualify in P9 was not so bad for him considering he’s not mastered qualifying on the BMW M 1000 RR yet. But typical Michael van der Mark, he grits his teeth, he gets his head down and battles his way and gets stronger and stronger as the race goes on which will do his confidence the world of good. So, we can put today behind us and focus on tomorrow and hopefully have a clean warm up and go into the Superpole race and race two strong.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I think if you look at the result it isn’t that bad, but it’s a shame I lost so much time in this morning’s session. In the races, I had a good feeling with the bike and we wanted to try something different in FP3, but we couldn’t do so. So now in the race I am struggling a little bit and unsure whether yesterday’s setting was better or not. But anyway, I am happy with the points, and I am looking forward to tomorrow’s two races.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was another good Superpole but I am disappointed with the race today, and disappointed at not being able to race with the other bikes. Riding in the group, we struggled with the engine temperature and braking performance all through the race unfortunately. We were quicker in the turns but couldn’t get close on the straights to make a pass on the brakes. So, it was a frustrating race but we will have to have another go tomorrow.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “After the really promising practice sessions, the race was really tough. I am finding it pretty difficult to get up to speed. With a full tank I had problems overtaking. It took a long time to pass one or two other riders. As soon as I was able to ride in my own style later in the race, things were much better. I hope we can find something for Sunday.” \n"}
{"prompt":"BMW SIM Racing has an extensive and diverse programme in store for the Esports community in 2021 – from BMW SIM Cups and BMW SIM Racing teams to technical innovations. In our monthly BMW SIM News, we briefly summarise news from the world of virtual racing, and provide information on driver backgrounds, teams, technology, and much more.  ->","completion":" BMW SIM GT Cup.After a summer break of two and a half months, the second half of this year's BMW SIM GT Cup season started with three races in August. This time, the world’s best sim racers were competing at the wheel of the virtual BMW M4 GT3, having completed the races during the first half of the season with the BMW M8 GTE. Tuomas Tähtelä and Pekka Tuomainen (both FIN) from the KOVA team claimed victory in the opening race with the BMW M4 GT3 on 1st August at the Imola circuit, booking their ticket for the year’s final at BMW SIM Live 2021. The teams in second to fifth positions qualified for the Season 2 finale, which gives them another chance to secure a spot at the year’s final. They will compete against the teams crossing the line in second to fifth positions in the other three races taking place in the second half of the season. Teams and drivers that have already qualified from Season 1 will not be classified in these standings. Others will move up to take their places. Two further spots have already been claimed. Alejandro Sánchez and Cristian Lamela (both ESP) from the MSI eSports team will both be there after triumphing in the second race in August at the virtual Circuit of the Americas. The third race at the 'Mount Panorama Circuit' in Bathurst was won by Maximilian Benecke (GER) and Enzo Bonito (ITA) from Team Redline. However, as they had already qualified for BMW SIM Live, the tickets went to their team-mates Chris Lulham (GBR) and Patrik Holzmann (GER) in second place. One more regular race is scheduled for 24th October at the Monza circuit. The Season 2 finale at the Hockenheimring will take place on 14th November. There will then be 24 drivers confirmed to race off for the year’s title at BMW SIM Live 2021. Defending champion is Joshua Rogers (AUS) from the Coanda Simsport team. He has already secured his return to the finale by claiming a win in the virtual BMW M8 GTE in the first half of the season. BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup.Just like the BMW SIM GT Cup, the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup also kicked off the second half of this year’s season in August. The settings for the two races held thus far were the circuits of Monza and Sebring, where Diogo Silva (POR) from the GTC Race Center team and Lorenz Hörzing (AUT) from the Jochen Schweizer Sim Racing Team secured their places at BMW SIM Live 2021. Silva needed no more than a fourth-place finish in the opening race, as the three drivers on the podium had already claimed their tickets for the finale in the first half of the season. The win went to Erhan Jajovski (MKD). The second race at the virtual Sebring International Raceway was won by Michal Smidl (CZE) ahead of Hörzing. As Smidl had already qualified, Hörzing was also able to claim a spot. In September and October, four more races at the circuits of Lime Rock Park, Loch Drummond, Spa-Francorchamps and Indianapolis will provide the opportunity to be part of the year’s finale at BMW SIM Live 2021. Jajovski will be there as he attempts to defend the title he won last year. BMW SIM Teams at Formula Medicine.For many years, BMW Motorsport has trusted in the expertise of Formula Medicine to ensure that the BMW works drivers can enjoy optimal physical and mental preparation for their competitive appearances. At the end of July, selected drivers from the BMW SIM Team also had the chance to gain some valuable insights into the training methodology at Formula Medicine during a workshop in Viareggio (ITA), and to get some important ideas for their own training schedule. The multi-day workshop included fitness and mental coaching sessions. These were accompanied by reaction exercises and nutritional advice. Enzo Bonito (ITA) and Kevin Siggy (SLO) were the BMW Team Redline representatives, Arthur Kammerer and Gregor Schill (both GER) took part for BMW Team G2 Esports, Nikodem Wisniewski (POL) and Petar Brljak (CRO) took part for BMW Team GB and Elias Seppänen (FIN) and Attila Dencs (HUN) represented BMW Team BS+COMPETITION. “The physical training was certainly useful for me as a sim racer, as we are also subjected to relatively significant force feedback effects on the arms, wrist and elbows through the steering wheel. It is important to strengthen these areas and to do something for the knees and stamina in general,” was Kammerer’s summary. “However, the mental coaching was the most valuable aspect for me – and that was the most fun part too. We had these multitasking exercises that showed me how easy it is for unexpected events or distractions to knock me out of my routine. I will now integrate exercises like this into my regular training routine. Good multitasking is helpful even just to discuss strategies during the race or to correctly calculate the amount of fuel without losing concentration, missing the right braking or steering points and therefore posting a poor lap time. Having the mental capacity for both things was an important core topic of the workshop. Overall, a perfect combination for mind and body.” \n"}

Having visited the two new circuits of Most (CZE) and Navarra (ESP), BMW Motorrad Motorsport is returning to familiar territory this weekend. From 3rd to 5th September, the eighth round of the FIM Superbike World Championship 2021 will take place at ‘Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours’ in the heart of France. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael der Mark (NED) already know the circuit very well from the WorldSBK. Jonas Folger (GER) and the Bonovo MGM Racing team, who are competing in their first full season in the WorldSBK, have already made a guest appearance at Magny-Cours in the French Superbike Championship FSBK. Magny-Cours lies around 250 kilometres south of Paris, the French capital, and has been a fixture on the WorldSBK calendar for nearly 20 years. A world championship race took place there for the first time in 1991 and WorldSBK has visited Magny-Cours each year since 2003. The combination of fast corners with long, straight sections and tight hairpin bends makes for a challenging track layout. Quotes ahead of the Magny-Cours round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The Magny-Cours layout has a bit of everything and is an interesting challenge for teams and riders. We have been very competitive there over the last two years. Tom Sykes reached the podium in 2019, while Eugene Laverty and Tom claimed double pole in a great Superpole qualifying in 2020. However, this year sees us visit Magny-Cours a few weeks earlier, which could mean different conditions – it will be warmer, even though we can probably expect some rain to make an appearance, as usual. We have set up our BMW M 1000 RR to be ready for all eventualities. Our aim is to give ourselves a good start position in qualifying and to keep on reducing to the gap to the very front during the race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The team is looking forward to Magny-Cours. It is a circuit that has suited the BMW in the past. We have made some good steps forward with the BMW M 1000 RR and I think the improvement that we showed in race two at Navarra, we’ve got to keep building on that. The Magny-Cours circuit is fast and flowing with some slower parts and we feel that Tom and Michael can have a positive event. FP1 is going to be really important; we need to find that early set-up for the guys and end up with a strong races one and two. Overall, we are really focused on going to Magny-Cours and having some consistent, fair weather to give a true reflection of the progress we are making and we look forward to the weekend.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am definitely looking forward to the French round of the WorldSBK at Magny-Cours. It’s a circuit which has given the BMW podium success in the past and obviously for me my target is to add to that. The aim is also to maintain our recent improvement in form that we found for example at Navarra. That is the target for the weekend. Of course, there is still work to be done with the new BMW M 1000 RR so we will try our best to find the best balance and compromise to do this inside the race weekend.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Magny-Cours is a track which I really enjoy riding. It always suits me. It has a bit of everything; fast and flowing sectors, stop-and-go corners, so it is a bit of a mix. Regarding the set-up of the bike, you also need to find some compromise here and there because it has all these different type of corners. I really love the first sector; that is one of my favourite parts of the track, but also the last sector is always nice for some good overtaking. I am looking forward to the weekend. We have improved our BMW M 1000 RR a lot and at Navarra, we struggled more with the high temperatures and I think we will not have that at Magny-Cours, so hopefully we have a bit more stable weekend. At Navarra, we made a big step lap-time wise in qualifying. Unfortunately for me it was so tight that I was still tenth, but if you look at the lap times, I made a huge step. We improved the performance there, so that is what we really need at Magny-Cours as well.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Magny-Cours is a great circuit. We competed as wildcard starters in the French Championship there last year. I am happy that we did that, as it means that I am familiar with the circuit now. It is a very challenging circuit, including a real range of corners. There is a pretty long straight, some slow corners. Sometimes it flows and then you have a bit of stop-and-go - it has a bit of everything. I hope that we make a good start to the weekend, work well with the BMW from the word go and that our race results then build on recent races.” Track Facts Magny-Cours.Circuit length4.411 km – clockwiseCorners17 – 9 right-handers, 8 left-handersPole positionRightLongest straightApprox. 900 metres (‘Golf’)Grip levelMediumTrack layoutSome sweeping turns, some stop-and-go passages, fast changes of directionStrain on brakesRelatively highAmount at full throttle32 % respectively 31 secondsTop speed \/ lowest speed295 km\/h \/ 46 km\/hBest overtaking opportunityT5Key factorsHigh speed through the corners, stability, good delay on entry into turns, wide range of performance \n"}

After an enthralling final round duel with Bryson DeChambeau, Patrick Cantlay has secured the prestigious BMW Championship 2021 title and his first Playoff victory. Victory had to be decided in a playoff, after both tied on a total score of -27 – the lowest winning score to par in the history of the tournament. DeChambeau was unable to match Cantlay’s birdie at the sixth extra hole, having passed up several good opportunities to claim the win during the playoff.“On behalf of everyone at BMW, I’d like to congratulate Patrick Cantlay on winning the 2021 BMW Championship, and say thank you to everyone who worked so hard to make this event a success,” said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “We at BMW have long considered the U.S. to be our second home, and this event is an important part of what we do – beyond serving as a national platform for our brand and products, it also provides an opportunity to raise money for the Evans Scholars Foundation.”Cantlay and DeChambeau, who played together in the final group on Sunday, quickly pulled away from the field to put on a duel that seemed more like matchplay. With Cantlay one stroke behind at the 17th, it seemed that the result had been decided when he landed his drive in the water. However, DeChambeau only recorded a bogey after a chip shot went wrong, allowing Cantlay to stay in the running with a bogey of his own. Cantlay then kept his sporting chances alive, sinking a 21 yards on the 18th green while his rival missed from much closer in.This pattern was set to continue in the playoff: DeChambeau put on a brilliant display with the driver and his irons and on several occasions he was presented with an easier putt to claim victory – but he proved unable to sink them, while Cantlay got himself out of a tight spot more than once with challenging putts. The decisive moment came at the sixth extra hole for Cantlay, who had been by far the strongest player on the greens throughout the week.South Korea’s Sungjai Im claimed third place, four strokes back (-23), ahead of Rory McIlroy (NIR, -22) and Erik von Rooyen (RSA, -21). Sixth place was shared by Dustin Johnson (USA) and Sergio García (ESP, both - 20), who are approaching top form just in time for the PGA TOUR Final and the Ryder Cup after middling seasons.All proceeds from the BMW Championship benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation (ESF) and its mission of awarding full tuition and housing college scholarships to caddies who would otherwise not be able to afford to study. The BMW Championship has contributed more than 36 million dollars to the foundation since the tournament debuted in 2007. The final total for the 2021 tournament will be calculated in around a week’s time. Alongside the ticket sales, the revenue from the Pro-Am tournament also makes an important contribution. This year’s Pro-Am event featured 23-time Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps, rapper Macklemore (both USA) and star photographer Paul Ripke (GER) on the tee.The BMW Championship represented the final opportunity for US golfers to score points for the Ryder Cup. The first six players in captain Steve Stricker’s squad have now been confirmed: Collin Morikawa, Dustin Johnson, Bryson de Chambeau, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas and Patrick Cantlay. Stricker will call up another six wild card entrants after the TOUR Championship. Qualification for the Ryder Cup Team Europe will end after the BMW PGA Championship (Wentworth Club, 9th to 12th September).\n"}

We have to rethink all our activities within the BMW Group and beyond.RE:DUCE – Using less to achieve more, wherever and however we can.This opens up enormous creative scope for ideas and possibilities. Imagine a new premium segment for the future, with new materials, different components and flexible combinations. The art is to leave things out without compromising on the driving experience.RE:USE – Extending the use of our products for as long as we can.We extend and expand the value, possible applications and use of our products by means of modernisation, digital functions and many other options. New mobility concepts will provide an interior that can be used in a variety of ways: for work meetings, for gatherings with friends, and as an additional living room. And, naturally, to drive from A to B. What is important is daily use and how we can inspire our customers every day.RE:CYCLE – Keeping resources in circulation for as long as we can.Using as many unmixed mono-materials as possible. Using materials that are already in circulation, such as recycled plastic, recycled aluminium and recycled steel. Detachable connections are essential for easy dismantling. Being able to separate materials more easily makes it easier to recycle them. What is important is the environmental footprint of our products and our business operations as a whole.Have fun discovering circularity with the CIRCULAR HEROESThe BMW Group is fundamentally resetting its design strategy with circular design, which focuses on circularity throughout the design process and far beyond. “Circular design is all about creating more with less; fewer resources, more emotion,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President of BMW Group Design, explaining the fascination of circular design.The principles of circular design are brought to life in a playful manner by the CIRCULAR HEROES, four sustainable characters created by Milanese architect and designer Patricia Urquiola who are constantly exploring the possibilities of design, shape, materials and colour. “Every time I work with BMW, I learn something new about mobility and the possibilities it offers, but this particular project is one-of-a-kind. I had the opportunity to experiment, work with utopian models and even venture beyond design boundaries,” says designer Patricia Urquiola, talking about her work on CIRCULAR HEROES. As each CIRCULAR HERO represents the various types of bond between parts and materials, each of them has their own specific approach.The BMW Group understands the RE:BMW Circular Lab as an invitation to join it on the circular path and shape the future – with the goal of discovering new perspectives together. At the occasion of IAA Mobility in Munich the RE:BMW Circular Lab will be presented at the BMW Group Open Space (Max-Joseph-Platz, Munich). Visitors are invited to join interactive workshops. Discover the RE:BMW Circular Lab now:www.bmw.com\/circular-lab RE:BMW Circular LabThe BMW Group is pioneering the development of a circular economy and efficient resource management.

BMW WorldSBK rider Eugene Laverty (IRL) and his wife Pippa visited Berlin in mid-August and had a busy schedule. Their first port of call was the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin-Spandau, where they were given a warm welcome. During the tour of the plant, the Lavertys took a look behind the scenes of the motorcycle production and met many of the employees. From Spandau, they travelled to Berlin-Tempelhof. Laverty had been planning to visit his BMW colleagues in the FIA Formula E World Championship for a long time, and finally had the opportunity to do so at the finale of the 2021 season – the BMW i Berlin E-Prix presented by CBMM Niobium. It goes without saying that he also took to the track on two wheels. Appropriately for the Formula E finale, Laverty took the brand-new, fully-electric BMW CE 04 scooter for a spin. “I really enjoyed my time in Berlin where I was able to combine a visit to the BMW plant as well as the final round of the Formula E World Championship,” Laverty said. “I felt a fantastic camaraderie amongst my BMW colleagues both at the plant and at the race track. I’d never before had the chance to visit somewhere quite like the BMW plant, the level of technology and the quantity of bikes produced daily is phenomenal!” “It was cool to get the chance to ride the track layout on the brand new electric BMW CE 04 scooter,” Laverty continued. “The bike is such an impressive piece of kit ideal for riding around the city. I was keen to test the bike’s top speed on the closed circuit. I am a racer after all! The fight for the Formula E world title went right down to the wire so as a race fan it was great to be there and feel a part of it. Thank you to everyone at BMW for making me feel so welcome.”\n"}

BMW Motorrad Motorsport has rounded off the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) race weekend at Navarra (ESP) by meeting the objective of securing a top five result for the BMW M 1000 RR. Tom Sykes (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team claimed fifth spot in race two on Sunday afternoon. His team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) was classified in ninth. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team finished twelfth, his second-best race result of the season. Sykes started the Superpole race in the morning from third place. He fell back a little at the start, taking the chequered flag in sixth after ten laps. Van der Mark improved from tenth on the grid to ninth and moved up to seventh for a while, before losing a place and crossing the line in eighth position. Folger slipped back several places after starting from 14th but was able to regain ground with some overtaking manoeuvres as the sprint race progressed and finished 16th. Sunday saw a repeat of the previous day’s high temperatures and the start of race two was delayed by ten minutes after a rider experienced some issues on the grid. The lights went out at 14:10. After a hard-fought first lap, Sykes and van der Mark had moved up from sixth and eighth into fourth and fifth positions. However, Andrea Locatelli (ITA, Yamaha) was able to pass van der Mark on lap three and overtook Sykes one lap later. That put Sykes in fifth place, and he maintained that top five position to the finish line after 22 laps. Van der Mark was seventh for a large part of the race, but lost a place in the closing stages and took the chequered flag in eighth position. After the race, van der Mark was demoted by one place for exceeding track limits on the final lap. Folger started the race from 14th on the grid. After the start, he fell back briefly to 16th place but then worked his way back up through the field, crossing the line in twelfth. Navarra hosted the seventh round of the 2021 WorldSBK season. The racing continues in two weeks at Magny-Cours, France, from 3rd to 5th September. Quotes after race two at Navarra. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “That was not an easy weekend for us, but we did manage to finish all three races with Tom and Michael in the points. Jonas also scored points in both main races. We didn't do as well as expected in the Superpole race this morning in the cooler conditions, however we did manage to claim sixth and eighth on the grid. That was certainly an improvement compared to the most recent races for Michael. It then paid off in the second race. After both made a good start, we were in fourth and fifth positions. Tom then fell back to fifth place but did some great defending against Alex Lowes. Michael certainly had more of a battle on his hands but compared to yesterday we closed the gap to the leaders by seven seconds. That's still not enough but it's going in the right direction. In the heat today, they both chose a different front tyre to yesterday, which will have made the biggest difference – and now we have to learn from that for the next high-temperature events coming up in Spain and Portugal.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a good step of improvement from yesterday. Tom rode very well today; he dug really deep and withstood a lot of pressure from Alex in the feature race and improved his overall race finish by six or seven seconds from yesterday. Tom will be pleased with his performance; we certainly are. A big shout out for him for that one. Michael just kind of never got comfortable with the bike on the bumpy circuit with a lot of front end chatter problems. He did well in his Superpole Race to move up a row so that was good for his start. I think he could have matched the pace of Alex and Tom in front of him but he just had a couple of moments and it prevented him from keeping that fifth, sixth, seventh position. Overall, it was not bad, improvement from yesterday, we still have some work to do but we can’t be too disappointed, so we can go away pretty happy.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was not a bad weekend. With the high track temperatures, it was definitely a challenging weekend. For the engines and for the riders, this kind of temperatures got to the limit in the afternoon race. Overall we have been trying to improve the set-up of the bike, certainly since as well the hot test in Catalunya, but still we had some limitations. We had some big problems in the race and we tried two different solutions from the tyre but I had some limitations in some different aspects to be fair. Even in race two I had some issues with turning and understeer, also rear traction. I just worked hard to try to managing the bike on brake pressure, in throttle openings and tried to make the best race I could. I had a lot of pressure throughout the race but we were able to deal with this. The best was lap one. We struggled to get a run on anyone this weekend but there was a bit of confusion between Alex Lowes and Andrea Locatelli and going into the turn at the end of the back straight that was a good opportunity for me so I took that and that gave me a good track position for the rest of the race.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a tough Sunday. In this morning’s Superpole race I struggled quite a lot with the front end of the bike. I just couldn’t attack anyone or stay with anyone so I was a bit disappointed but anyway, I gained a few starting positions for race two. I then had a good start but I immediately felt that I was losing at the exits compared to the others so I tried to push more on the front but I didn’t feel good and it was quite a long and tough race. We need to improve that but at least we got some points, we always keep trying and I am looking forward to Magny-Cours now.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “The Superpole race was pretty good, even if the start didn’t work out, which was the case for all three races. We had problems with the clutch at the start all through the weekend, and we need to work on that now. My pace was good in the second half of the Superpole race. The weather was also a bit cooler, which generally suits us. After a difficult start to race two, the pace was also OK. I am not entirely happy with the weekend but we did score some points. Of course, some other riders took a tumble and that helped us but I made it through OK and we achieved our objective of scoring points.” \n"}

Sykes finished the afternoon’s race in sixth position. His team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) crossed the line in seventh. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team was also in the points, finishing 14th. 1:36.546 minutes was the lap time recorded by Sykes in the morning’s Superpole qualification. That enabled him to take the lead for a brief period before finishing the 15-minute session with third place, on the front row of the grid secured. Van der Mark ended the hard-fought qualifying session in tenth position. Folger qualified in 14th place. A special surprise lay in wait for van der Mark on the grid later when BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers and Shaun Muir, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team Principal, presented the new father with a BMW Babyracer. Air temperatures had already reached 24 degrees Celsius by late morning, climbing to over 30 degrees by the time the race began. Sykes fell back a little in the turmoil at the start but then maintained sixth position for the duration of the 23-lap race. He was within striking distance of the top five for some time, but the gap then grew larger. Van der Mark was able to get into eighth before moving up to seventh on lap seven, where he remained until reaching the finish line. Folger dropped back after losing ground at the start, however he moved up to 14th as the race progressed to secure a points finish. Quotes after race one at Navarra. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Sixth and seventh in the race – that corresponds to where we are at the moment. Our pace was clearly better in this morning’s practice. The temperatures kept climbing though as the race approached. We had already struggled with that in practice yesterday. Tom did very well in qualifying to secure a great third place. He established himself in sixth position relatively quickly in the race and was able to maintain that. Michael had a relatively good qualifying session. He finished tenth but was just a tenth of a second away from fifth. In the race, he lost a few seconds again during the first laps. Our aim for tomorrow should be fifth place instead of sixth and seventh. It is important for us to deliver a strong performance tomorrow in the Superpole race, with the aim of reaching the top five. That is realistic for us this weekend.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I was really pleased with FP3 in the morning when Michael set a quick pace very early so he had a good run of laps and was confident going into Superpole. Equally Tom found a good set-up as well and was pretty happy so we quickly confirmed the tyre choice for the rear tyre. In Superpole, Tom as usually did a great job putting it on the front row in the top-three. He made good use of his qualifying tyre. We used a slightly different strategy for Michael; he ran one exit with the ‘X’ tyre and then changed to the ‘Q’ tyre. It worked really well and it was a much improved performance compared to Most. Okay, tenth place was not where we wanted to be but it was an improvement. In the race, Tom settled into a race pace which was pretty much where he was at the end of the race. He could not gain much advantage but settled into a good rhythm. Michael got stuck behind a couple of riders and lost four, five seconds on the opening few laps. Once he got by and settled into it, he could not bridge the gap. Both riders struggled with the front in the heat. Overall, we can’t be too dissatisfied with sixth and seventh. 20+ seconds off the win is not where we want to be but we will try to close that gap tomorrow.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was not too bad. We had a good qualifying and starting from the front row is always a nice target. Coming off the start, another rider came by me and almost took my handle bar so I had to close the gas and a Kawasaki had gone by. So the first lap wasn’t very good and then, to be honest, behind Alex Lowes on the first couple of laps, it was just a bit too steady so I need to have a look at that for tomorrow. I need to try to get a better start and first couple of laps but after that I just settled into the rhythm that we found yesterday afternoon. It looks like everyone was suffering a little bit more today because the times were slower than yesterday afternoon. I really struggled with the front end of the bike with the turning and some of the rear traction so for sure it was a difficult race to manage. We had to change the way to approach some corners et cetera and try to find a way to ride around those problems so we’ve got a lot of work to do tonight and hopefully we can improve the set-up for these hot conditions tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “To be honest, I was expecting a lot more. This morning, we made a huge step in performance and in lap time consistency. Also in Superpole, we’ve made a good step. I was tenth but the gap to P5 was really close. I was happy with that, but in the warmer conditions in the race the bike just did not react like in the cooler conditions. It’s normal but I struggled too much so we need to find a solution for tomorrow.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Our start position in the race wasn’t bad. Unfortunately, I didn’t make a great start. I had a wheelie and lost a few places. On the second lap, I then went straight on in turn 1 while I was trying to overtake another rider. I was back in 21st or 22nd then, but my lap times were nearly as fast as the riders around tenth. Now we have to analyse what happened, as the wheelie at the start was unusual and has not happened at all during practice. We will carry on working and see what we can achieve from 14th on the grid tomorrow.” \n"}

The world title was within touching distance, but luck deserted Jake Dennis (GBR) during the farewell race for BMW in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. Despite retiring from the season finale at the BMW i Berlin E-Prix presented by CBMM Niobium (GER), he completed his rookie season in Formula E with an outstanding third position in the drivers’ standings. BMW i Andretti Motorsport finishes the season in sixth place in the team championship. This race marks the end of BMW’s works involvement in Formula E after recording seven race wins in three years as a works team and seven years as Official Vehicle Partner. The home race in Berlin provided BMW Group with a stage to demonstrate the current range of fully-electric production vehicles whose drivetrains benefited significantly from the knowledge gained in the competitive environment of Formula E. Jake Dennis started the 15th race of the season from ninth on the grid, just four points off the lead in the overall standings. The race was quickly over for two of his title rivals after a collision between Mitch Evans (NZL, Jaguar) and Edoardo Mortara (SUI, Venturi). That put Dennis in a promising position for the restart, only for a jammed rear axle to put paid to his world title ambitions as he slid into the wall and was forced to retire. Nyck de Vries (NED, Mercedes) went on to secure the title but Dennis was still able to finish third in the drivers’ championship with 91 points despite his retirement – an outstanding performance in his rookie Formula E season. Maximilian Günther (GER) was 18th place in qualifying and a bold race strategy was not enough for a points finish. He finished 15th, ending the season in 16th position in the overall standings. BMW i Andretti Motorsport completed its final season as a BMW works team in sixth place in the team championship with 157 points. Reactions to Race 15 in Berlin. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal, team standings: 6th place):“We came into this final race with a really good chance of winning the World Championship with Jake. Practice sessions went not quite as smoothly as yesterday and in qualifying he again just missed Super Pole by a few hundredths of a second. Still, he was in a good position having most of his title contenders behind him. Then at the restart after the unfortunate collision between Mitch Evans and Edoardo Mortara we suspect a technical issue with Jakes car that we yet have to analyse. The rear axle locked and Jake was just a passenger. At that point his championship hopes were over, but I told him: ‘You must have had a pretty good season if you are disappointed with third place in the championship’. If someone had offered that position to us after the first two rounds, we would have bitten his hand off. Jake did an amazing job in his rookie season with his two race wins. Maximilian went in the wrong direction with his setup and didn’t really have a competitive car in this race unfortunately. Today we are disappointed, but once all has settled in, I think we can be very proud of what we have achieved together as BMW and Andretti Formula E and of the hard work that everyone has put into it to get us to this point. Of course we would have loved to continue like this but it is not to be. We are excited what Season 8 swill bring for us. I say thank you to everybody, not only the team on the front line but also everybody in the background who helped to make this project a success. Thank you very much!” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 8th place, race result: 5th place, points: 91, driver standings: 3rd place):“It’s a shame that the title fight ended like this – not only for me but for Mitch Evans and Edoardo Mortara as well. Three title contenders out of the race early. It felt like there was a technical failure at the rear, but I don’t know yet what exactly happened. The rear tyres complete locked before I even had a chance to do anything. It’s a sad end, but nevertheless we had an incredible season and a want to thank everybody for working so hard and giving me the chance to fight for the world championship.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 18th place, race result: 15th place, points: 66, driver standings: 16th place):“Starting from 18th, our aim was of course to make up as much ground as possible. We went for a bold strategy but unfortunately that did not pay off. I made some progress at the start and had a few good fights but we noticed early on that the level of grip wasn’t quite there, and that we were a bit off the pace. I gave it my all at the end but a points finish was just out range, sadly. I would have liked to have managed that to finish the season. Many thanks to BMW for some great times in Formula E. It was an honour for me to be part of it for two years. We enjoyed many great moments together as BMW i Andretti Motorsport and I will never forget them.” Summary: BMW i Andretti Motorsport in Formula E.BMW i Andretti Motorsport competed as a works team for the first time in Season 5 – and made a perfect start. António Félix da Costa (POR) claimed pole position and the win as the BMW iFE.18 debuted in Diriyah (KSA). Alexander Sims (GBR) also gave the team a perfect start to Season 6 in the same location, recording two pole positions and a win in the BMW iFE.20. Maximilian Günther (GER) then gave two triumphant performances in Santiago (CHI) and at the home race in Berlin. Season 7 saw Günther claim his third win for BMW i Andretti Motorsport in the BMW iFE.21 in New York City (USA). Jake Dennis topped the podium twice in his Formula E rookie season, at Valencia (ESP) and at his home race in London (GBR). In three seasons together, BMW i and Andretti Autosport celebrated a total of seven wins, five pole positions and twelve podiums. Lessons Learned: Formula E as TechLab for BMW i production drivetrains.After seven years as ‘Official Vehicle Partner’ for Formula E and three seasons of works team racing, the BMW Group is withdrawing from the race series. The farewell appearance included a look at the BMW iX, the BMW i4, the MINI Cooper SE : 14.9 - 16.9 kWh\/100km,  (NEDC): 0 g\/km) and the BMW CE 04 Scooter, which are spearheading the current range of fully-electric vehicles. From the word go, the driving force behind the involvement of BMW i and BMW Motorsport in Formula E was the development of innovative technologies in the area of electromobility, which are also relevant for series production. Most of the opportunities for technology transfer between motor racing and production have largely been exhausted. An enormous amount of knowledge gained has been included in the fifth generation of E-drivetrains, which are already on the road in the BMW iX3 ; 19.0-18.6 (WLTP); electric range (WLTP) in km: 450-458)* and will continue to be applied in the BMW iX, the BMW i4 and other fully-electric vehicle models. Examples:\n"}

The season finale in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is set to be a thriller – with Jake Dennis (GBR) playing a leading role. The BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver finished fifth in Saturday’s race at the BMW i Berlin E-Prix presented by CBMM Niobium (GER), moving up to third in the drivers’ standings. He is just four points away from first place in the battle for the world title. Maximilian Günther (GER) crossed the line in eighth place to score more crucial points for the team championship. BMW i Andretti Motorsport is in sixth position with 157 points, just 14 points behind the leader. Dennis had dominated both practice sessions on Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, recording the best time in each. He did not manage to reach Super Pole from group one in qualifying, but claimed eighth place on the grid and a good start position. Günther began the race in tenth place. Both BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers dropped back a bit at the start, before working their way back into the points with some efficient driving and smart use of Attack Mode. Dennis was battling for third place right to the end and was delighted to have finished fifth, scoring ten points. Victory went to Lucas di Grassi (BRA, Audi). The 15th and final race of the season is on Sunday at the same location. It will take place on the reversed Berlin-Tempelhof circuit and starts at 15:30 CEST. Reactions to Race 14 in Berlin. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal, team standings: 6th place):“The Berlin event started really well for us with Jake showing very strong pace in both practice sessions. Unfortunately he got caught up a little bit on his flying qualifying lap, which cost him one and a half tenths and a place in the Super Pole shootout. Still we had solid start positions with both drivers. We hung in there in the race, made clever use of energy, tyres and Attack Mode. Both drivers made good passes when they needed to and defended well when they needed to. The outcome for Jake is third place in the championship. He has everything to play for tomorrow. Maximilian scored important points for the team. Looking at how close it is in the standings, I’m really excited for tomorrow and confident we can have a strong finish to the season.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 8th place, race result: 5th place, points: 91, driver standings: 3rd place):“My aim before the race was to finish fifth but then we had a really bad start and lost some positions. After that we came back strong and the car behaved very well. At the end we didn’t quite have the pace anymore to fight for the podium to be honest. Being a rookie entering the final race of the season just four points behind the leader sounds really good. To be fair it’s just incredible. I’m so proud if what we have done here at BMW i Andretti Motorsport. I’ll just enjoy the race tomorrow and have no pressure. If I fail, we still had an amazing season together. If I do good, I might win the championship. I’m excited.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 10th place, race result: 8th place, points: 66, driver standings: 14th place):“Unfortunately, I damaged the nose of my car in the first corner after the start which made me lose some ground. However, we got our race set up well and had energy and tyre wear under control. In the end, eighth place was the best we could have achieved I think. Getting both cars into the points was very important for the team. Everything is possible tomorrow and I am sure it will be a great day for us.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race.

The MINI STRIP (co-)created by Paul Smith is celebrating its world premiere in London on 12 August 2021. This custom-made one-off car is a product of the collaboration between MINI and Paul Smith announced in November 2020, which has resulted in these two iconic British brands sharing creative thoughts on sustainable design for the past few months. The MINI STRIP shines the spotlight on an innovative approach to the issue of sustainability in automotive manufacturing. Guided by the overarching theme of ‘Simplicity, Transparency, Sustainability’, the car showcases inspirational ideas for a more sustainable method of automotive design. As the name suggests, the process began by completely stripping down a three-door MINI Cooper SE and reducing it to its structural essence. Only those elements that the designer viewed as absolutely necessary were then defined, implemented and put in place – with sustainability taking a front seat.“For me, the MINI STRIP shows in an impressive way that MINI and Paul Smith share the same bold way of thinking about the future in terms of innovation and design - and together we create more. Paul asked essential questions right at the start of the design process with his non-automotive and therefore fresh perspective. We are proud to have developed such a strong character statement together.“ explains Oliver Heilmer, Head of MINI Design.An outside perspective provides an important source of inspiration.MINI has always been receptive to views from beyond its universe; they help the brand to sharpen its view of itself and of how it approaches challenges. As a designer with a passion for bicycles, books and much more besides, Paul Smith asked questions that provided fresh new impetus to explore beyond the obvious. “I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to rethink the iconic MINI,” he says. “I know and love the existing car, but by respecting the past and looking to the future we have created something very special. I feel very privileged that the MINI team have given me the confidence and freedom to think laterally about the approach to the design of the car. Together I think we have created something truly unique, by going back to basics, reducing things down and stripping the car.”The design – the perfect imperfection.The jointly-led process applied the principle of maximum reduction to produce a minimalist, high-class design with a fresh and unconventional appeal. Numerous clever touches endow the exterior of the three-door MINI Cooper SE with a totally unique aesthetic. Raw materials are a very deliberate part of the exterior design. This meant the body was left in its unfinished state with no coloured paint applied, but instead just a thin film of transparent paint to protect against corrosion. Grinding marks from the factory have been consciously left intact on the galvanised steel panels to clearly identify the car as a functional object and robust companion for everyday life. This intentionally rough-hewn effect was also dubbed “the perfect imperfection” by Paul Smith.The unaffected expressiveness of the materials.Sections of the familiar MINI black band are 3D-printed from recycled plastic and their basic material qualities have been left exposed, like the metal panels. Bicycle enthusiast Smith – who enjoys rolling up his sleeves occasionally and replacing or modifying individual parts of his road bikes himself – provided the inspiration for the visible screws in the add-on parts, which show how simple dismantling would be and how easily the vehicle could be reincorporated into the raw-material cycle at the end of its service life. The functional and distinctive front and rear apron inserts were likewise manufactured in a 3D printing process, which produced their striking texture.The blanked-off radiator grille of the MINI STRIP and its wheel covers help to reduce drag in hallmark electric car fashion, thereby increasing its theoretical range. The grille trim and aerodynamic covers on the wheels are made from recycled Perspex, saving both weight and resources. Recycled Perspex was also used for the large panoramic roof that allows curious eyes to view the largely bare structure of the bodyshell inside.A love of detail. MINI calls it a ‘twinkle in the eye’, Paul Smith a ‘classic with a twist’ – both refer to unexpected details such as high-contrast colour accents that are only revealed through the designers’ work at second or third glance, betraying their fondness for details. The same is true of the MINI STRIP: Opening the doors reveals the signature Paul Smith stripes in a vivid composition of five colours. The charging flap adds a splash of neon green when opened, while the engraved drawing of an electric plug on the flap is Paul Smith’s own work.Radical reduction in the interior. The MINI STRIP holds true to the motto of ‘Simplicity and Transparency’ on the inside, too, courtesy of some radical stripping-back. All trim parts have been purposefully omitted (with the exception of the dashboard, topper pad and parcel shelf), turning the bodyshell into the dominant visual feature of the cabin. It has been coloured blue at the explicit request of Paul Smith, producing a particularly eye-catching effect. The exposed basic material and intense blue tone give the interior an aesthetic appeal all of its own; it is bare yet feels “dressed” at the same time.Instead of the usual multi-part design, the dashboard consists solely of a large, semi-transparent section with a smoked-glass finish. Taking its cue from MINI design’s traditional use of circular elements, the geometry has been greatly simplified with a far more graphical interpretation. There is no classical centre instrument, leaving the driver’s smartphone to take centre stage instead. It is placed where the centre display would normally be, connects automatically to the car and, in so doing, becomes the media control centre. The only physical controls in the interior are located lower down in the centre stack, where the toggle switches for the power windows and the start\/stop function can be found.Innovative materials conserve resources.Alongside the minimalist geometric design inside the MINI STRIP, the use of recycled, environment-friendly materials also underpins the car’s sustainability credentials. The interior is completely free of both leather and chrome, with seats upholstered in a knitted fabric. The completely mono-material design for the seat coverings means they are fully recyclable, including the piping, allowing material circularity to be maintained. The floor mats are made from recycled rubber. Their terrazzo-like pattern is a by-product of the recycling and manufacturing process and positively showcases the multi-coloured constituent elements enjoying a second life as part of this material.The dashboard topper pad, door shoulders and parcel shelf also display a highly simplified geometry and are made from recycled cork. The type of cork used here doesn’t contain any synthetic binding agents and is also fully recyclable. With its pleasing firmness combined with a soft feel, cork could provide a substitute for foamed plastics in future. Due to cork’s recyclability and its status as a renewable raw material that actually “fixes” carbon dioxide during its production, there is potential here for reducing greenhouse gases. Another positive side effect of knitted fabric and cork is that they are both open-pore materials that enhance interior acoustics.Minimalist and functional – the details.The steering wheel, which is also a focal point of the interior, has been reduced to the most essential functions. Its rim has been wrapped in handlebar tape in true road bike style. Three aluminium spokes connect the rim to the steering wheel’s impact absorber, whose mesh covering makes it possible to see the airbag behind. As on the outside of the car, there are visible screws here showing how easy it would be to dismantle the steering wheel at a later date and reuse the aluminium. A small fabric Paul Smith label in the one o’clock position is one of the pointers to the collaboration that can be found in the interior.The door panels are made from the same mesh material that covers the airbag. The door structure can be clearly seen behind the mesh panels, which are held within a frame. The transparency of the knitted mesh changes according on the angle of view, adding a further dimension to the interior’s appearance. The pull handles in the door shoulders are made from wound climbing rope and, together with the matching seat belts, liven up the interior with their bright orange finish. Like the pull handles, the door openers in milled aluminium are housed in the cork door shoulders and provide a high-class finishing touch for the door area. As the eye wanders further up the door, it arrives at the exposed airbag unit in the roof pillar. This has the same effect as the visible cable routing in the interior, deliberately drawing attention to functions that are normally concealed during manufacture and employing them to aesthetically agreeable effect.Sparking ideas for a more sustainable future.Form follows function in all the ingenious details incorporated into the MINI STRIP. Simplicity, transparency and sustainability formed the central themes of the design process and shine through in every aspect of the car. This has enabled the MINI STRIP to translate MINI’s Creative Use of Space philosophy into a radical and fundamental redesign of a MINI – especially in the interior. As such, it can provide a catalyst for more sustainable use of resources in automotive design.\n"}

For BMW i Andretti Motorsport and its drivers Jake Dennis (GBR) and Maximilian Günther (GER), anything is possible in the battle for the world championship titles in the team and driver standings. Dennis is in fourth place going into the final two races at the Berlin-Tempelhof airport grounds. In the support programme for the races, BMW Group will present its range of electric production cars, the drive of which benefitted greatly from development in Formula E. “BMW i has been a partner of Formula E from the outset, and we are delighted to conclude this unique partnership, after seven successful years, with another highlight, the title sponsorship at our home event in Berlin,” said Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand Communication and Brand Experience BMW Group. “I would like to thank Formula E and, on behalf of the whole organisation, Alejandro Agag, Alberto Longo and Jamie Reigle. The BMW i Berlin E-Prix will be the highlight of the season for us. As well as the fully-electric BMW i3s and BMW iX3, we also have the MINI Electric Pacesetter in action as the safety car and are delighted to be able to present our latest products, including the BMW i4 and BMW iX, to the guests and spectators permitted at the event. We have our fingers crossed for our drivers Jake Dennis and Maximilian Günther, and the BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team at the season finale.” Dennis goes into the final two races in fourth place in the overall standings with 81 points after his second win of the season at the London E-Prix (GBR), and trails leader Nyck de Vries (NED, Mercedes) by just 14 points. Günther has 62 points to his name. In the team standings, BMW i Andretti Motorsport is in fifth place with 143 points, which sees them trail the top spot by 22 points. Both of the races at the weekend will use two track versions familiar from last year in Tempelhof. Saturday’s race will be held on the standard track. Then the track will be driven in the opposite direction on Sunday. This will require the track to be converted, which will take place overnight. Saturday’s race gets underway at 2.00 p.m. CEST, while Sunday’s race starts at 3.30 p.m. CEST. Quotes ahead of the BMW i Berlin E-Prix: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“Berlin will be a very special race weekend for the whole team; not only is it the end of the championship and there is all to play for, but it is also the final two rounds for the factory partnership between BMW i and Andretti Formula E. A partnership that came together formally in Season 5, it started with a pole position and a win, and hopefully we can close out together in a similar manner. I am sure there will be many mixed emotions come the end of the weekend. The championship points are so close, almost anything can happen between Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon. The unique nature of the track surface means that tyre management will be key. The weather also looks to be quite hot and that should suit the efficiency of the BMW i drivetrain.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21):“It feels like it was just yesterday that I contest my first Formula E race in Diriyah. We’ve come a long way since then, won two races in my rookie season and are right in the middle of the battle for the world championship. I’m really excited for Berlin and will give it my all to make use of the momentum and drive for the title. But we can already be very proud of what we have achieved as a team this season.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21):“I’m super excited for the season finale in Berlin. Two track layouts in two days is a real challenge, and one that we have prepared well for. We are still right there in the battle for the title in both championships, and the home fans at the track make the atmosphere even more special. We will give it everything we’ve got once again for the final two races for BMW as a works team in Formula E.” TRACK FACTS BERLIN.Track length2.355 km. Saturday: Anti-clockwise.

The Autodrom Most debut in the FIM Superbike World Championship ended with a solid day of racing for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. In the Superpole race on Sunday morning, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished fifth and eleventh. In the afternoon’s second race, van der Mark climbed ten places to finish as the best-placed BMW rider in seventh. Sykes came home in ninth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from BMW Team Bonovo MGM Racing narrowly missed out on the points in race two, finishing 16th. First on Sunday morning was the Superpole race, which Sykes started from fourth place. He lost one position in the turmoil at the start, before holding onto fifth place right through to the finish after ten laps of racing. Van der Mark climbed into eleventh place from 17th on the grid. Folger was 18th, having started 21st. Van der Mark gave another eye-catching performance in race two on Sunday afternoon, gaining ten positions with an impressive fightback. Having started 17th, he crossed the finish line 22 laps later in seventh place, just half a second outside the top five. After the start, van der Mark had to take evasive measures to avoid a multi-bike crash, before launching his assault on the front of the field. By lap three he had reached the top ten. After seven laps, he was running ninth. The Dutchman climbed into seventh place on lap 17. Team-mate Sykes spent the majority of the race in the top six, but then fell back a few positions to ninth in the final third of the race. Folger, who again started from 21st place, raced into 17th place on the opening lap. He then continued to make progress into 16th place and eventually crossed the finish line in that position, just 0.210 seconds outside the points. Quotes after race two at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “I think we can be pleased with the results today. Tom had a very good Superpole race and didn’t have to go straight on at T1 so he could stick in his fifth position and brought it home very well. Michael had a good catch up all the from 17th, but the first lap was difficult and he lost nearly five seconds to the front runners in the first lap. He finished one second off P9 which would have given us ninth position on the grid, but it was not meant to be so we started 17th again with Mickey for the feature race. In race two, Michael confirmed his very good pace and to come all the way from 17th to seventh is pleasing, although this confirms that you need to start in those first three rows. With Tom, we will have to see which issues he had. He was still quite close in the group but couldn’t hold his position and dropped down to ninth. Jonas had another difficult day so we will have to investigate what is going on there, but he doesn’t have his mojo at the moment. Overall, it was nice to be in Most, and to have the fans back with us. It is a nice track layout however with some safety points to be raised for next year.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The Superpole race gave us everything we had hoped, all but the fact we didn’t quite get that ninth position that Michael needed to give him an increased grid position. Tom made a really good job on the ‘X’ tyre and did well to finish fifth. It was a real shame for Mickey; if he had just got into ninth position it would have made a real difference in main feature race. Nevertheless, Michael did really well not to get tangled up in a crash in the first corner and got to work really quick and one by one picked off the riders in front of him. I think another lap and we could have had sixth, but it proves how strong Michael is feeling with the BMW M 1000 RR, so overall a good job by Michael. Tom got a good start but got a bit stuck in the middle of the race really and couldn’t improve his lap time. He got passed by a few riders but still commendable to finish ninth. So, overall, we leave Most frustrated on Friday, not so bad on Saturday and a lot happier Sunday.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I think the at the end of the weekend it was not too bad. Especially this morning in the Superpole race I had such good pace, I improved over a second compared to yesterday and I was really happy on the bike. Unfortunately, I didn’t get a good start, I was a bit unlucky at T1 and couldn’t gain as many positions as I hoped so for race two I had to start from 17th again. The first run off the line was good and then the bike started to wheelie so we lost a little bit of time. Something happened at T1, but I was quite smart and took a tight line and avoided a lot of people. After that we had good pace and I was catching the guys in front one by one but I just couldn’t get by Rinaldi. Together we passed some people and in the end I tried to grab sixth or fifth. Overall, I think after all the struggles this weekend the team deserved a solid result.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It is what it is, I’m not entirely happy. In the sprint race I was able to maintain ten laps but in the second race I was struggling to just finish off the turn in the latter stages. There is still work to be done. We made a couple of small changes but we can’t do what our competitors are doing in the last eight laps. We have learnt a lot this weekend and certainly I’ve been close to several bikes, so I know where we are strong and where we need to work on. Overall, it was not the best weekend but there were some positives in Superpole and in the sprint race, so now for the longer race we can look to improve that package and keep working.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Today’s race was the best of the weekend, even if it was not quite as successful as I had envisaged. I had difficulties setting fast lap times this weekend, and am still having issues with various areas of the bike. We will keep working hard, comparing the data with that of Tom and Michael, and hope to take the next step forward. My goal is to consistently finish in the points.” \n"}
{"prompt":"Saturday in the Czech city of Most began with a strong Superpole result for BMW Motorrad Motorsport but ended with a disappointing race result. The FIM Superbike World Championship is making its first appearance at Most, where it is staging round six of the 2021 season. ->","completion":" Most. Saturday in the Czech city of Most began with a strong Superpole result for BMW Motorrad Motorsport but ended with a disappointing race result. The FIM Superbike World Championship is making its first appearance at Most, where it is staging round six of the 2021 season. In Superpole, Tom Sykes (GBR) of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished fourth on his BMW M 1000 RR, narrowly missing out on the front row of the grid. He then came home ninth in race one. Sykes’ team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) made an impressive fightback in the race before crashing out. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team retired with a technical issue. Sykes came up just 0.015 seconds short of a place on the front row of the grid in Saturday morning’s Superpole qualifying. However, fourth place also put him in a good position going into the race. Van der Mark had to settle for 17th place in Superpole. Folger, who had crashed in the morning’s third free practice session, qualified 21st. Sykes climbed into third place at the start of race one. However, he went wide in turn one while having to avoid other riders and slotted back into fifth place. On lap five, he again headed straight on in turn one when he was touched by another bike. Finding himself in tenth place, Sykes attempted to work his way back to the front of the field, but then had issues with the rear tyre. He ultimately crossed the finish line in ninth place. Starting from 17th on the grid, van der Mark launched a spirited comeback on his M RR. However, having climbed into eighth place, that comeback came to an abrupt end. The Dutchman was one of several riders who crashed out of Saturday’s race. Folger had been continuously moving up the field towards a points finish until a technical issue forced him to retire on lap seven. Quotes after race one at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The outcome of the race has been disappointing. In Superpole, Tom gave a strong performance, he was right up there, and his race simulations looked good in practice. During the race, he had to abort at T1 twice going straight on, so he lost several positions throughout. Mickey had a very disappointing qualifying but, in the race, made up in the early stages as he usually does. He had good pace during the race and was catching the P6, P7 group in front of him which would have been a good result to come home with, but he unfortunately crashed. So we take the positive point from today that the pace from Michael was there, but if you don’t bring it home you get no points, so it was disappointing overall. Jonas unfortunately retired due to an engine failure, so we have to look into the cause. Now we hope for a better day tomorrow.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We always aim for the first two rows as it’s a great position to be in and Tom did just that in Superpole. In the race, Tom got pushed wide going into the first corner and reacted quickly not to lose many positions and time. The SC0 was the tyre of choice for the race and he got into a pretty lonely battle at the end of the day so he will equally be disappointed to finish 26 seconds off the win. Michael had a difficult qualifying session but come the race he did true Michael van der Mark style to battle and come through into a good position. He was doing lap times in that race he hasn’t found all weekend, so I am more pleased he was able to find that comfortable feeling and his confidence ahead of tomorrow. Unfortunately, he crashed at T20 which is easy to do with the temperatures increasing. But we are not totally disappointed, we will come back stronger tomorrow as we gained a lot of information.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The qualifying result for sure was nice. When we put the Q tyre into the BMW M 1000 RR, I am able to ride the bike much more naturally, and the bike does things much better. But unfortunately for the race there was a mix of tyres. We went down the safer route and this certainly did not help us. After the start, going into T1 I was in there and I’ve been happy with my braking all weekend, but the guys had stopped, and I didn’t want to collect anyone, so I took the option to spoil my first lap. Then the second time somebody was up the inside of me and touched my handlebar, so I wasn’t able to make the turn. For tomorrow, we will look to improve the set up, and we will revisit the tyre choice. Overall, I am a little bit disappointed, also disappointed with the final race result but we have learnt a lot today. Tomorrow we will get two more chances.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a really disappointing day, to be honest. In Superpole, I had bad traffic on both outings on the Q tyre, which was such bad luck. It’s a shame as I felt we could really make a step forward, so it was not easy starting from P17 on the grid. Anyway, in the race I got a good start and had good pace. I was fighting my way towards the front and was feeling good with the bike but unfortunately when I was sat in P8 I lost the front going into T20. I was trying hard so it’s a shame because we lost some valuable points. It was a difficult day overall, but we can be happy with the pace we had in race one.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I was quick in yesterday’s first free practice session, but unfortunately I then had a crash in practice this morning. The mechanics managed to get the bike ready just in time for qualifying. As a result, I only rode two laps before we went into Superpole. That was probably why I didn’t manage a good time. In the race, I noticed when changing gear that there was a problem with the engine, which unfortunately then failed. It was a tough day.” \n"}

This will function as a meeting place and focal point for BMW teams, partners, guests and – as soon as this is possible again – fans. The new BMW Hospitality will be operated for BMW Motorrad Motorsport by the BMW works team Shaun Muir Racing. “I am really proud to see how our WorldSBK project is developing and how it has grown since our comeback,” said Schramm, before cutting the symbolic tape to officially open the hospitality area. “And it is great that our large BMW family now has a new home in the paddock: our brand-new BMW Hospitality. Special thanks are due to Shaun Muir and the whole SMR team for making this possible. Now we are looking forward to celebrating some great moments together in our new hospitality area.” Shaun Muir Racing has been a partner of BMW Motorrad Motorsport in WorldSBK since the works re-entry and this collaboration has now been extended. “We are delighted to present our new hospitality unit,” explained Shaun Muir. “This runs alongside to our new agreement with BMW Motorrad Motorsport and shows our investment to the project and the level we want to achieve in line with our championship winning expectations. We value the involvement of our VIPs and sponsors and I think this addition to our assets compliments the level we want to achieve. More than that, it is a great opportunity for fans and partners to meet and come into direct contact with the team.” The new BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Hospitality was owned previously by a Formula 1 team and was adjusted to meet its new requirements during months of painstaking alterations. The result is a prestigious structure with space for more than 100 guests each day. The two-storey building contains three dining areas. The 132 m2 main deck on the upper floor has room for up to 50 seats and a lounge corner. The race events will unfold on two large 70-inch screens, which can also be used for Esports activities. In addition to the food buffet, there is a coffee bar in this area and a self-service corner with a large selection of drinks. The upper area is connected to the large kitchen on the ground floor via a service elevator. Depending on the type of use envisaged, the 72 m2 ground floor can seat at least 25 guests and is a multi-functional space that can be a showroom for motorbikes or for one car. The exterior of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Hospitality is clad in the recognisable BMW M Motorsport colours. The overall appearance includes a 36 m2 sun terrace with 30 seats, where guests can relax under two broad canopies. Food can be prepared for 100 guests each day in the modern catering kitchen that is integrated into one of the trucks. This can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as preparing snacks throughout the day for guests and the BMW teams. As soon as the Coronavirus situation permits, SMR and BMW Motorrad Motorsport will once again be offering weekend packages including hospitality access for interested guests and fans. The BMW Hospitality unit can also be reserved for external events.

Everything is ready for the classic endurance race in the Ardennes: Walkenhorst Motorsport secured a promising starting position for the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) in Super Pole qualification on Friday evening. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) claimed fifth place in the #34 BMW M6 GT3, Thomas Neubauer (FRA) finished the final qualifying session in the #35 BMW M6 GT3 in 14th place. Van der Linde is sharing the cockpit in the #34 car with Marco Wittmann (GER) and David Pittard (GBR). Neubauer will be driving the #35 car with Martin Tomczyk and Timo Glock (both GER). The two BMW M6 GT3s put on a strong performance in Thursday’s multi-session qualifying, which was red-flagged several times. The average of the best times for the individual drivers in each car is calculated to determine qualifying classification. The 20 fastest cars move on to Super Pole. This posed no problem for Walkenhorst Motorsport, with fifth place for the #34 car and #35 in sixth. On Friday afternoon, it was time for a different event, the FANATEC Esports GT Pro Series race. This sim racing series is a central element of the FANATEC GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, which also includes the 24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps. Each team nominates a driver who competes in the race on the Assetto Corsa Competizione platform and can score points for the real overall standings. Victory at Spa-Francorchamps went to BMW as Pittard won the sim race for the Walkenhorst Motorsport team. Super Pole followed on Friday evening, a shootout with two flying laps for each car. Rain began to fall just before the start of the final qualifying session, but the conditions were still conducive to driving on slicks. The two BMW M6 GT3s went out onto the track, one after the other. Van der Linde recorded a fastest time of 2:18.590 minutes, which was enough to secure fifth on the grid for him and his team-mates. Neubauer claimed 14th place, going round in 2:19.011 minutes. “That was a really good Super Pole for us and that makes me happy,” said van der Linde. “We are also aware that qualifying is not decisive at Spa, so I am confident about the race. I think that we’ve got a good race car, which is what counts. But it was nice to be driving in Super Pole for the first time. Thanks to the team for placing their trust in me. Now I am hoping that we can record a great result.” “It is not easy to compete against the world’s fastest GT3 drivers in Super Pole, and when you see a bit of rain as you are getting into the car, things get a bit more tense. But we were still able to push on dry tyres and the track conditions were good,” reported Neubauer. “Us BMW drivers had a decent qualifying session, and especially Sheldon did a mega job so congratulations to him. Our plan is now to make a good start, then to keep our heads down and avoid making any mistakes.” The #10 BMW M6 GT3 car from Boutson Ginion Racing, competing in the Pro-Am Cup, will be starting from 45th position. Jens Klingmann (GER), Karim Ojjeh (KSA), Jens Liebhauser (GER) and Yann Zimmer (SUI) will be sharing driving duties in this car. Right after Super Pole, BMW M Motorsport provided a glimpse of the future as the new BMW M4 GT3 completed several demonstration laps of the ‘Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps’. The new GT3 flagship, which will be competing as of 2022, appeared with Glock at the wheel before Klingmann took over. “It was so much fun driving the new BMW M4 GT3 here. Those were my very first laps in this car, but I have to say that all the hard work that has been put into this race car has really paid off,” explained Glock later. “As soon as you get into the BMW M4 GT3, you feel good. The driving position and the level of driving comfort are just as good as everything else. The car feels very, very good right away and delivers convincing driveability. The guys really did some outstanding work. I am already looking forward to getting some more laps in with the car, but that was a very positive start.” “Driving the first demo laps with the new BMW M4 GT3 was definitely something special,” said Klingmann. “That gives you an idea of what next year will be like, when we will hopefully be battling for overall wins with that car. But I think that the demo laps were enough to realise just how much potential the car has. I can now compare it directly with the BMW M6 GT3, which I am also driving here this weekend, and I think that the car gets a great reception in the paddock. A lot of teams have already shown an interest, which shows that BMW M Motorsport is on the right path with the BMW M4 GT3.” The 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps will start on Saturday, 31st July at 16:30.\n"}

The flood disaster in Germany and Belgium is another important topic. Among other things, the BMW Group is donating 1.5 million euros to support the rescue services in the disaster areas. As an expression of sympathy, the BMW race cars at Spa-Francorchamps will bear the message ‘We stand together’. As in the races already completed in this season’s Endurance Cup – at Monza (ITA) and Le Castellet (FRA) – Marco Wittmann (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and David Pittard (GBR) will compete in the #34 BMW M6 GT3 for Walkenhorst Motorsport. Timo Glock, Martin Tomczyk (both GER) and Thomas Neubauer (FRA) will share the wheel of the #35 car. Both crews recently finished in the top ten in the 1000 km of Paul Ricard. The team receives support from BMW M Motorsport partners Akrapovič, BMW M Performance Parts, CATL, MultiBank Group, and Shell with the running of both cars. Spa-Francorchamps was the scene of Walkenhorst Motorsport’s greatest success so far. The team from Melle (GER) took overall victory in 2018. Three years prior to that, Glock was among those who caused quite a stir when he shared the driving duties in a BMW Z4 GT3, sporting a Michel Vaillant look, with Bruno Spengler (CAN) and BMW brand ambassador Alessandro Zanardi (ITA). Thanks to BMW M Motorsport Team Boutsen Ginion Racing, this year’s starting grid will again feature a BMW car with a Michel Vaillant design. In the Pro-Am Cup, BMW works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) races alongside Karim Ojjeh (KSA), Jens Liebhauser (GER) and Yann Zimmer (SUI) in the #10 BMW M6 GT3. Glock and Klingmann will play a main role in a joint show event, put on by BMW M Motorsport and series partner FANATEC after Friday evening’s Superpole. The two BMW works drivers will complete a number of demo laps in the new BMW M4 GT3, during which they will demonstrate the globally unique feature of the steering wheel. It was designed to be used in both a real race car and a race simulator. To showcase this, Glock and Klingmann will use the identical steering wheel in both the car’s cockpit and a simulator. The BMW M4 GT3, which caused people to sit up and take notice a few weeks ago with the best time at the official tests at Spa-Francorchamps, will be on display in the paddock all weekend. From 2022, the BMW M Motorsport teams will do battle for victories and titles around the world with the new GT flagship. Quotes ahead of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps: Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “This 24-hour race is particularly poignant given the catastrophic flooding we have experienced, some of which has been very close to the Nürburgring and Spa-Francorchamps racetracks which we all love so much. Our thoughts are with all those suffering as a result of the floods. From a sporting point of view, our goal is to bid farewell to the BMW M6 GT3 by adding another success to the outstanding record it has enjoyed at Spa-Francorchamps in the past. The car took overall victory in 2016 and 2018, and I am confident that Walkenhorst Motorsport can play a major role again this year. Furthermore, we are heralding the era of the new BMW M4 GT3 with a number of demonstration laps. It gave an indication of what sort of speed it is capable of a few weeks ago, at the official tests, even if that was without any opposition and in a classification of its own. We are looking forward to a varied weekend.” Niclas Königbauer (Team Manager Walkenhorst Motorsport): “This weekend, we return to the scene of the Walkenhorst Motorsport team’s greatest success to date. We know that the BMW M6 GT3 is strong at this circuit, and want to mix it at the front of the field again in the car’s final race at Spa-Francorchamps. We have fantastic drivers, who are definitely capable of challenging for the podium, and hopefully even the win.” Sheldon van der Linde (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “I’m really looking forward to racing at Spa together with Marco Wittmann and David Pittard and trying to win again for Walkenhorst Motorsport, who have shown before how strong the team and the BMW M6 GT3 are on that track. I think it would be the perfect farewell for the car in its last year. We had strong pace in the last race at Le Castellet but couldn’t bring it home so we have some unfinished business. I would love to win this race, after having finished third there in 2018 – behind two BMW M6 GT3s…” Timo Glock (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “I am really looking forward to driving in the 24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps again, having appeared alongside Alex Zanardi and Bruno Spengler last time out at this event. Unfortunately, on that occasion we only managed 23.5 hours instead of 24. As such, our goal for this year is obviously to finish the race – and, if possible, in a good position. It is a very special race. The circuit is simply outstanding, and Spa-Francorchamps always guarantees good racing. For this reason, I am looking forward to taking on the race together with Martin Tomczyk, Thomas Neubauer and Walkenhorst Motorsport. I am excited to see how it plays out, and am looking forward to the challenge of the 24 Hours of Spa.” Jens Klingmann (#10 BMW M6 GT3, Boutsen Ginion Racing): “For me, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps is the biggest GT3 race in the world, with more than 60 cars in the starting line-up. Together with Boutsen Ginion Racing and my fellow drivers in the Pro-Am class, I will be striving to finish for the family, even if the class is a very strong one. I am also really looking forward to the show run in the BMW M4 GT3. It is a great honour to present the car to the fans and the other teams on this occasion.”\n"}

Spearheading the BMW contingent was Ben Green (GBR) in the #10 BMW M4 GT4, who was runner-up in both races for the FK Performance Motorsport team. In race two on Sunday, Green was joined on the podium by Michael Schrey (GER) in the #2 BMW M4 GT4 of Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport. Green, who had started the season with a victory in the opening race at Monza (ITA) back in June, was once again in contention for the top step of the podium in both races. In race one, he missed out on the win by less than half a second, crossing the finish line in second place. Race two was even closer. Green led at times before eventually finishing just three-tenths of a second behind the winning car. In the championship standings, Green is currently second after four races. Schrey, who won race two of the season at Monza and added another podium at the Lausitzring, is third in the Drivers’ Championship. In the Team competition, FK Performance Motorsport is currently second, ahead of Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport. --BMW M2 Cup: New racing series makes its debut at the Lausitzring. The new BMW M2 Cup made its debut during the DTM weekend at the Lausitzring (GER). The new series features spectacular racing with the BMW M2 CS Racing. 17 cars were in action at the season-opener in the Lusatia region of Germany. The dominant driver on the inaugural weekend of the BMW M2 Cup was Tim Heinemann (GER), who secured both pole positions in the #78 BMW M2 CS Racing and went on to claim comfortable lights-to-flag victories in both races. In Saturday’s opening race, Heinemann finished almost nine seconds ahead of his closest rivals. In race two on Sunday, his lead was over four seconds. Runner-up in race one was Fabian Kreim (GER \/ #43). In race two, second place went to 16-year-old Salman Owega (GER \/ #7). The third place on the podium in both races was occupied by Louis Henkefend (GER) in the #17 BMW M2 CS Racing. The second event of the season takes place from 6th to 8th August at Zolder, Belgium. More information on the BMW M2 Cup can be found on the official website bmwm2cup.com. Image and video material is also available for download here in the ‘Media’ section. --IMSA: Eventful race weekend at Lime Rock Park. The second half of this season’s IMSA series got underway at Lime Rock Park (USA) in mid-July. The competitors in the IMSA WeatherTech Championship and the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge had an eventful race weekend at times. On Friday, unsettled weather presented a real challenge for the teams. In GTD qualifying in the IMSA WeatherTech Championship, the #96 Turner Motorsport BMW M6 GT3 finished seventh. The only way was up for drivers Bill Auberlen and Robby Foley (both USA) in the Saturday race, which was scheduled to last two hours and 40 minutes. However, an intense thunderstorm forced the race to be suspended after 90 minutes, and it was never re-started. That left Auberlen\/Foley in fifth place. They currently lie second in the Drivers’ Championship. Friday’s qualifying for the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge was shortened following a crash. Auberlen qualified second in the #95 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT4, which he shares with Dillon Machavern (USA). In the two-hour race on Saturday, a technical issue resulted in the duo dropping well down the field. They eventually finished 16th in the GS class. Foley and Vincent Barletta (USA) were eighth in class in the #96 BMW M4 GT4. The AutoTechnic Racing team competed with the #52 BMW M4 GT4, driven by Attilio Albani and Elivan Goulart (both USA). They came home eleventh in the GS class. Auberlen and Machavern continue to lead the GS standings, but are now tied at the top of the standings. --British GT Championship: Leaders Century Motorsport on the podium at Spa-Francorchamps. The British GT Championship was in Belgium at the weekend, where Spa-Francorchamps hosted round four of the 2021 season. It was another successful weekend for the Century Motorsport team – despite the additional weight the team had to bear as a result of its brace of victories at round three at Donington (GBR). Gus Burton and Will Burns (both GBR) in the #57 BMW M4 GT4 secured pole position in a hard-fought qualifying session on Saturday. The two-hour race on Sunday was an eventful one. In the end, Burton\/Mills finished third overall in the GT4 class and second in the Silver class. Their team-mates Andrew Gordon-Coldbrooke and Chris Salkeld (both GBR) gave a courageous fightback in the #9 BMW M4 GT4. Having dropped through the field following a drive-through penalty, they recovered strongly to finish fifth overall and fourth in the Silver class. In the GT4 Drivers’ standings in the British GT Championship, Burton and Burns still hold a commanding lead with 111.5 points. They are followed in second place by Gordon-Coldbrooke and Salkeld with 81 points. Burton\/Burns also lead the Silver class, with Gordon-Coldbrooke\/Salkeld the top pair in the Pro-Am competition. In the GT4 Team standings, Century Motorsport are top with 196.5 points and a seemingly-unassailable lead of 132 points. --Super GT Championship: Round four at Motegi. The Japanese Super GT Championship held its fourth round of the season at Motegi (JPN) in mid-July. In the thick of the action was BMW Team Studie with the #7 BMW M6 GT3, driven by Seiji Ara and Tomohide Yamaguchi (both JPN). The summery heat, with temperatures reaching 33 degrees Celsius, made for challenging conditions. In Saturday’s qualifying, the #7 was the fastest Pro-Am car and finished 13th overall. However, the team then had to retire from Sunday’s race due to a technical issue.\n"}

In Martinique, he will explore the unexpected and surprising in the familiar environment of his ancestors.  ->","completion":" Munich\/Basel\/Paris. BMW Art Journey winner 2021 Julien Creuzet, represented by High Art, Paris, started the first part of his BMW Art Journey on July 15, 2021. In Martinique, he will explore the unexpected and surprising in the familiar environment of his ancestors.The BMW Art Journey is part of BMW Group’s global cultural engagement, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Committed in the fields of modern and contemporary art, classical music, jazz and sound as well as architecture and design, the BMW Group has been an integral part of culture on a global scale.Inspired by the Martinican thinker, critic and poet Édouard Glissant who had written about the concept of creolization, “It is a mixture of arts, customs and languages ​​that produces the unexpected,” Creuzet will make five trips in total to the Antillean islands Martinique and Guadeloupe between July 2021 and Spring 2022.Creuzet himself was raised in Martinique, but never had the chance to work there. About his BMW Art Journey he says: “I strive to make my contribution, to give back by offering my experience and a place, a living world, a workstation for long-term experimentation. My journey is related to a long-time project that I had in mind, but I was never able to realize it. It is a good opportunity for me to return and to re-connect with my native land. I have shown and shared my practice and perspective around the world, but never in the land of my ancestors.”During his BMW Art Journey Julien Creuzet will focus on three artistic projects around the geographically and culturally distinct region of the Antilleans. Filming landscapes, underwater scenes, and local festivals such as carnival, on the ground and with drones, he will create a video in collaboration with local contemporary artists and musicians.A second project is an eight months-long workshop with the art students of Beaux-Arts de Fort-de-France (Campus Caribbean des Arts), opening a studio for their artistic work. One focus of the workshop will be about the creation of “bwadjacks” – sculptures made of modified cars and materials which are usually found on scrapyards, in a gesture of circularity.Lastly, Creuzet will work on a project with the local fauna of the Antilleans. Drawing inspiration from natural forms, he aims to create new hybrid sculptures recycling plastic and other materials. The results of his BMW Art Journey are expected to be shown during Art Basel in Hong Kong in 2022.About Julien Creuzet at High Art, ParisJulien Creuzet (b.1986) lives and works in Montreuil, France. He creates protean artworks incorporating poetry, music, sculpture, assemblage, film and animation. Evoking trans-oceanic postcolonial transactions in relation to multiple temporalities, the artist places his own inherited past, present and future at the heart of his production. Eluding generalized narratives and cultural reductions, Creuzet’s work often spotlights anachronisms and social realities to construct objects of irreducibility. Recent solo exhibitions include Camden Arts Center, London (upcoming); Palais de Tokyo and Fondation d'entreprise Pernod Ricard, Paris. His work was featured in group exhibitions at Manifesta 13, Marseilles; Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt; Musée d’Art moderne de Paris and Centre Pompidou, Paris. Creuzet is a nominee for the Prix Marcel Duchamp 2021.Julien Creuzet was selected for BMW Art Journey 2021 from a shortlist of three artists represented by galleries originally accepted into this year’s Art Basel show in Hong Kong, in an online jury process. The international jury of experts included Claire Hsu, Executive Director, Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong; Matthias Mühling, Director, Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau, Munich; Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, President, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin; Philip Tinari, Director, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing; and Samson Young, artist and winner of the first BMW Art Journey. About the BMW Art JourneyLaunched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging artists worldwide. Since 2020, the circle of eligible artists has broadened and includes not only emerging and mid-career artists from the Discoveries sector, but also artists represented by galleries founded no more than ten years ago at Art Basel’s show in Hong Kong. In recognition of the ongoing exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic, the jury conducted its selection process online. The selected artists were then invited to submit proposals, based on which the winner was selected.Past winners of the BMW Art Journey include sound and performance artist Samson Young (presented by a.m. Space, Hong Kong, at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2015); video artists Henning Fehr and Philipp Rühr (presented by Galerie Max Mayer, Dusseldorf, at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2015); Abigail Reynolds (presented by Rokeby, London, at Art Basel's show in Hong Kong in 2016); Max Hooper Schneider (presented by High Art, Paris, at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2016), Astha Butail (represented by GALLERYSKE, New Dehli, Bangalore, at Art Basel´s Hong Kong show in 2017), Jamal Cyrus (represented by Inman Gallery, Houston, at Art Basel’s Miami Beach show in 2017); Zac Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland, at Art Basel’s Hong Kong show in 2018), Lu Yang (represented by the gallery Société, Berlin, at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2019) and Leelee Chan (represented by Capsule Shanghai at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2021).Art Basel and BMW will collaborate with the artist to document the journey and share it with a broader public through print publications, online and on social media via @julien.creuzet, @artbasel and @bmwgroupculture.For further information and press material about the BMW Art Journey artists and their projects, please visit the press section: www.bmw-art-journey.com\/press \n"}

The two riders from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team showed fighting spirit to deliver convincing performances once again in Sunday’s race in the FIM Superbike World Championship at Assen (NED). In the Superpole race, Tom Sykes (GBR) put on a thrilling chase to move up from 18th to seventh place. In the afternoon, Michael van der Mark (NED) overcame difficulties during race two to improve by five places and secure another top result by finishing sixth. After his crash on Saturday, the race doctors did not grant clearance for Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing to compete on Sunday. After some heavy rainfall, there was still water on and around the circuit in the morning, causing the warm-up session to be postponed by 50 minutes. The start of the morning’s Superpole race was then also pushed back by ten minutes. The track was then dry, but conditions still proved to be treacherous in places. Sykes once again gave a fantastic chase. Starting from 18th on the grid, he moved up ten positions with his BMW M 1000 RR on the first lap and secured seventh place on lap four. That was where he finished the sprint race, claiming seventh spot on the grid for the afternoon’s second race. Van der Mark also made a good start from ninth only to take a fall a short time later. This put him eleventh on the grid for race two. At the start of the second race, two riders collided at the front in turn one – while van der Mark was able to leap forward six places to move into fifth. Sykes claimed seventh position on lap one, but then fell back a little. Van der Mark also lost some time. During the second half of the race, van der Mark and Sykes were then involved in a duel lying in eighth and ninth places, all while closing in on the top six. Events took a dramatic turn coming into the final lap; van der Mark was able to overtake two rivals and secure sixth place, while Sykes took a tumble. He was able to rejoin the race and finished 15th to score a point. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, was at Assen to experience the race weekend on site. “It was super to be back again,” said Schramm on Sunday afternoon. “I hadn’t been here for over a year and I really missed it. It was also the first time that I had seen the new BMW M 1000 RR in action in the WorldSBK. It was great to see the BMW family again and to view the progress that we have made with the M RR. That is what made it a good weekend.” BMW Motorrad Motorsport can now look forward to a first in two weeks’ time; Most, in the Czech Republic, will host the WorldSBK for the first time when the sixth event of the season takes place there from 6th to 8th August. Quotes after race two at Assen. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Our achievements did not match our expectations today. Things did not go smoothly. Michael made a very good start to the Superpole race in the morning, but he crashed after letting his motivation get the better of him. The after-effects of that certainly hampered his efforts in the second race. He had a great race nonetheless, finishing sixth from eleventh on the grid. Tom had a really strong Superpole race this morning, moving up from the back of the field to seventh with some outstanding pace. That pace could have taken him to within grasp of a podium from seventh on the grid this afternoon. He fell back a little in the early stages of the race and then battled his way back together with Michael. He then slipped out over the front wheel just before the end, but was able to cross the finishing line in 15th to score a point. Overall, we definitely could have done better this weekend. I think that we have shown potential but we were not able to convert it into results as we had hoped.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “After Saturday’s race one where we were reasonably happy with the results overall and showed strong lap times, we were looking to carry those over into today. But it was a tough Superpole Race. For sure, Michael felt he needed to be with that front group of riders which yesterday’s pace indicated he could do that. But he unfortunately crashed out which was a disappointment and set him back to 11th on the grid for race two. Tom managed to push his way through and improved on his starting position, which was perfect. Going into the race, there was a bit of a coming together at T1 which unsettled the pack, but Michael settled back into a rhythm. However, he couldn’t find the grip he was looking for. Tom was waiting for his tyre to come to him but again got stuck in a battle where he was just off the leading two packs. Overall, it was a tough race. We expected a little more from the performances but all in all we are showing the improvement of the bike and that gap to the front is getting narrower at every event. This is the target with the podium in sight. We take the positives from this weekend and move to Most where we will pick up the game from there.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This morning’s crash was a stupid mistake by myself. I really wanted to go for it, and on the fastest corners of the track I tried to go even faster which was a silly mistake on my behalf. In race two, I had an okay start. I had a bit of luck at T1 starting in P11 and by the end of lap one I was in fifth but I didn’t have the pace or the grip I was hoping for. I was struggling to keep the bike on track and I just didn’t have any more to give so it was quite tough. But at the end of the race I found a little extra pace and managed to catch and pass Michael Ruben Rinaldi and Alex Lowes so P6 wasn’t too bad in the end. But I really wanted more.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We managed to start race two on the third row which was a lot better. We got a much cleaner start to the race as the guys did a bit of work to the BMW M 1000 RR. We used the harder rear tyre and just couldn’t find the grip we needed at the beginning of the race but having said that, the bike stayed very constant throughout the race. Unfortunately coming into the last corner before entering the final lap, I tried to close the line and square the corner off and lost the front. It was such a slow speed crash, but I wasn’t able to save it. It’s such a shame, the bike today was good enough for that top-six and it would have been nice to be consistent the whole weekend. It certainly seemed we have made some good improvements including both me and Michael. A disappointing end to the weekend but we can take the positives from it, and we will focus on that and try to build on it for the next round.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was a really great weekend - until the crash. I am delighted that we were able to show once again that we have the speed and that we can really compete. That did us all a lot of good. I actually wanted to race today. I am still in some pain and a bit stiff walking, but I felt ready. Unfortunately, the race doctors did not give me the OK. I would like to thank the team for their great work nonetheless and for getting us back on track. Thanks also to everyone who has sent their best wishes after my crash. Now it’s time for a few days of recovery and then we will go back on the attack at Most the weekend after next.” \n"}

At the final concert of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 held on Friday evening, the Peter Gall Quintet won over the award’s renowned jury. Together with saxophonist Wanja Slavin, Dutch guitarist Reinier Baas, pianist Reiner Böhm and up-and-coming bassist Felix Henkelhausen, drummer Peter Gall prevailed against the dam Bałdych Quartet. Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, presented the prize together with Anton Biebl, Head of the Department of Cultural Affairs of the state capital Munich.Following the theme “The Melody at Night”, the concerts of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 were presented at BMW Welt’s double coned structure and for the first time on Tuesday evenings. Having been postponed for over a year due to the global pandemic, the final concert of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 now took place at the philharmonic hall at Gasteig, thanks to the city of Munich.The expert jury said: “Both finalists convincingly brought the motto ‘The Melody at Night’ of this BMW Welt Jazz Award edition to life with a personal twist of their own. Adam Bałdych has once again proven to be a technically and stylistically unique violinist. And the drummer Peter Gall, who has already shown his brilliance in so many ways while participating in the projects of others, has proven to be an outstanding composer and great band leader with his very first work of his own. Together with his dream team, the all-star quintet starring Rainer Böhm, Reinier Baas, Wanja Slavin and Felix Henkelhausen, Gall generates a veritable intoxication of sound. As complex and interconnected the song structures are, they are simultaneously powerful, exciting and simply created to take in and enjoy. Many elements flow into this endeavor – and everything fits together fantastically as well as harmoniously. A real somnambulistic ‘Dreambox’ as the album is titled. A magic box so thrilling and inspiring that the jury would like to congratulate Peter Gall and his quintet for winning the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020.”Peter Gall Quintet received a prize money of 10,000 Euro as well as the trophy designed by BMW Design. The runner up Adam Bałdych Quartet was awarded 5,000 Euro.In addition to the award and supported by the jazz award’s partner Bayerischer Hof, the public’s favorite was also selected. Based on audience votes at each performance, Adam Bałdych Quartet excited the guests and will therefore receive an exclusive performance at the Night Club of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich.Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Director of Hu-man Resources and Labour Relations, praised the skills of the finalists: “I am delighted that we were now able to hold the final concert of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 this year and celebrate its winner. My fullest congratulations to the Peter Gall Quintet. I would also like to thank our long-standing partners, especially the state capital Munich. Together with them, the BMW Group stands for reliability and takes its social and cultural responsibilities seriously for already 50 years now.Therefore, it gives me great pleasure that the BMW Welt Jazz Award will also be continued next year. Following the theme ‘Key Position’, the BMW Welt Jazz Award will focus on one of the characterizing instruments of jazz music: the piano. It has been playing an important role and has been inspiring audiences from the very beginning with ragtime and boogie woogie over great bigband pianists and legends of modern jazz until now.”“I cannot think of our city’s cultural life without the BMW Welt Jazz Award anymore. The series of concerts at BMW Welt with high-ranking jazz ensembles gives free access to thousands of music fans for many years now. I am very grateful to our partner BMW for their great and continuous cultural engagement over all those years. It fills me with joy that by providing the philharmonic hall for this year’s final concert, a large audience could be a part of it following the necessary COVID regulations,” said Anton Biebl, Head of the Department of Cultural Affairs of the state capital Munich.Different from the previous years, there were only five instead of six performances given by renowned ensembles from around the world in the double coned structure of BMW Welt in January and February 2020. Besides the two finalists, the musicians playing in the double cone structure of BMW Welt were: Cecilie Grundt Quintet (Norway), the Andrea Hermenau Quintet (Germany) and Reis\/Demuth\/Wiltgen (Luxembourg). The sixth concert with the Giovanni Guidi Quintet (Italy) had to be cancelled due to related measures taken to control the corona virus. The Italian jazz pianist and his quintet will now perform at BMW Welt Jazz Award 2022 following the theme “Key Position”.The winner of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 was selected by a top-class jury of reputable jazz experts and connoisseurs.

To celebrate 50 years of cultural commitment, BMW is joining forces with Acute Art to initiate a unique exhibition: For the first time ever the renowned BMW Art Car Collection is shown in augmented reality (AR). On July 21, the project is launched via the free Acute Art app, marking the first time that the digital rolling sculptures are available for everyone all around the world at any time.Initiated by French race car driver and art aficionado Hervé Poulain and conceived in collaboration with the founder of BMW Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch, the first BMW Art Car was commissioned when both asked Alexander Calder to design Poulain’s BMW race car in 1975. Since then, 19 prominent artists from throughout the world have designed BMW automobiles of their times, all making extremely different artistic statements and reflecting the cultural and historical development of art, design, and technology. On the occasion of 50 years of BMW Group Cultural Engagement, the Art Cars are finally entering the digital realm and can virtually be staged in this wholly immersive 360° exhibition: indoors, outdoors and in any location the user desires.On July 21, the first BMW Art Cars can be experienced via the App: Alexander Calder (BMW 3.0 CSL, 1975), Michael Jagamara Nelson (BMW M3, 1989), Ken Done (BMW M3, 1989), Matazo Kayama (BMW 535i, 1990), Esther Mahlangu (BMW 525i, 1991), Jeff Koons (BMW M3 GT2, 2010) and John Baldessari (BMW M6 GTLM, 2016). From then on, further BMW Art Cars will be integrated in the Acute Art App every two weeks. On time for the Art Basel in Basel all Art Cars will be included in the App.To fully discover and experience the interactive BMW Art Cars, the Acute Art app is available free of charge on the App Store and Google Play.1.

The app requires a phone with a minimum of 4GB of memory and Apple iOS 11 or Android 8.0 Oreo (API 24) operating system. For more information, please visit acuteart.com.The BMW Group is committed to supporting and facilitating culture, partnering with world renowned institutions and artists. Through mutual respect and curiosity, BMW is connecting people through culture across the globe – both physically and virtually. This is why BMW is partnering up with Acute Art: to push the physical boundaries of art by exploring the medium in a different dimension.“The BMW Art Cars are an essential part of the DNA of BMW’s 50-year-long cultural engagement. Finally, they are entering the digital realm and can be accessible everywhere and for everyone. I am excited about the collaboration with Acute Art as we both strive for innovation and cutting edge technology. I can‘t wait to place the Art Cars in my living room and get behind the wheel of these exceptional masterpieces!”, says Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. Acute Art collaborates with the world’s leading contemporary artists, providing access to cutting-edge technologies that allow them to translate their creative vision into new digital mediums – including virtual, augmented and mixed realities. Today’s immersive media give rise to new possibilities for the production and distribution of art and the arrival of augmented reality makes possible entirely new exhibition formats.“We are thrilled about this partnership with BMW, a company that has demonstrated an exceptional commitment to technological innovation and art over decades” says Jacob De Geer, CEO of Acute Art. “Acute Art was founded on the vision of democratising art and bringing it to places where it could not be before. In these challenging times we have to find new solutions. The collaboration with the BMW Group will intensify the exchange between technology, design and art. Together we will explore future landscapes involving today’s most innovative minds working in these fields.”Acute Art’s collaboration with the BMW Group will make the Art Cars digitally visible anywhere in the world for the very first time. Through the app, they can be individually displayed, or users can also display multiple vehicles together at the same time. To this end, the real Art Cars were carefully scanned from all angles using a photogrammetry methodology, capturing every detail of the artists’ intervention on the car's surface. Finally, the cars were assembled digitally to create an accurate representation of the Art Cars in AR.During Art Basel in Basel, Switzerland, the BMW Group will celebrate 50 years of cultural commitment with this unique interactive exhibition at a private event on September 21. The BMW Art Car by Alexander Calder will be on display and a specially created augmented reality area will invite guests to experience the digital Art Cars in the Acute Art App on-site. \n"}

{"prompt":"Share prices, stock market indices, interest rates and growth rates: The heart of the German financial industry beats in the metropolis on the Main. On a city tour with the plug-in hybrid model from MINI, it becomes clear that the electrified all-rounder can also shine with values that make a lasting impression on cool calculators. ->","completion":" Munich. Anyone approaching the banking metropolis of Frankfurt am Main on the Autobahn 5 from the north will see it from afar: the skyline of skyscraper towers where, among others, the major financial institutions have set up their headquarters. No other city in Germany welcomes its visitors with a comparable panorama. Frankfurt is not only the seat of the German Stock Exchange and the European Central Bank, but also home to the four largest national financial institutions. The city where the heart of finance beats has a long tradition as a trading centre and trade fair location. Frankfurt has always paid close attention to figures. So it is fitting that the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 can score points on the test drive through the urban area and the neighbouring regions not only with driving pleasure typical of the brand, but also with tangible data.Four doors, five full seats, two engines and four driven wheels - these are the elementary figures from which both the versatility and agile handling as well as the high efficiency of MINI's first plug-in hybrid model can be derived. In detail, this means: a three-cylinder petrol engine with 92 kW\/125 hp from a displacement of 1.5 litres drives the front wheels, while a 70 kW\/95 hp electric motor transmits its power to the rear wheels. This results in a system output of 162 kW\/220 hp and a hybrid-specific all-wheel drive. The precisely controlled interaction of the two motors optimises the vehicle's tracking ability in the city and its sporty cornering performance on country roads, as well as its traction on slippery roads and unpaved terrain.In city traffic, the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 can be driven purely electrically. On the drive through the canyons of office towers, to which the city owes its nickname \"Mainhattan\", it thus becomes a pioneer for sustainable mobility. Almost the entire inner city area of Frankfurt is designated as an environmental zone. Thanks to the Euro 6d emissions standard, the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 is likely to start its combustion engine there, but in local emission-free driving mode it immediately sets an example for clean driving pleasure.An important argument for calculators who are as cool as they are environmentally conscious: anyone who drives to their place of work in the city every day from their home in the surrounding countryside can easily do this too in purely electric mode with the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4. The right figures to go with it: The electricity that powers the electric motor is stored in a high-voltage battery with a gross energy content of 10.0 kWh. This gives a combined electric range of 44 to 51 kilometres. And electric commuting not only significantly reduces energy costs. Using the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 as a company car also comes with a rebate from the tax office. For the plug-in hybrid model, only half of the otherwise usual imputed income has to be taxed.This spares the budget for shopping trips. In Frankfurt's city centre, visitors have a choice between luxury boutiques and the branches of large fashion chains, especially in Goethestraße and on the shopping mile Zeil. Those who want to eat something in between will find something nearby on Grosse Bockenheimer Strasse, which is known to the locals as \"Fressgass\" for a reason.One of the special features of Frankfurt's cityscape is the juxtaposition of the hypermodern glass and steel facades of modern office complexes with historic buildings. No fewer than 17 buildings reach the status of skyscraper with a height of at least 150 metres. The old town, on the other hand, impresses with other values. The Römer, the city's magnificent town hall, dates from the 15th century and, like the Kaiserdom, the Paulskirche, where the first German parliament met in 1848, the birthplace of the poet Johann Wolfgang Goethe, and the more than 400-year-old Haus Wertheim with its original half-timbering, is one of the sights that survived both the Second World War and the building and modernisation boom of the post-war era.While sightseeing, shopping or visiting the renowned Schirn Kunsthalle on Römerberg, time flies. Meanwhile, the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 can replenish its power reserves at one of the numerous public charging stations in the city. After just two and a half hours, the high-voltage battery has reached 80 per cent of its total capacity again with an output of 3.7 kW.This means the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 has enough energy for an excursion into the green surroundings of the big city. In the west of Frankfurt, the Taunus begins just beyond the city limits. A popular local recreation area stretches between the Feldberg and the Rhine-Main plain and can be reached quickly via the Frankfurt motorway ring. In purely electric driving mode, the plug-in hybrid model reaches a top speed of 135 km\/h. If both engines are used together, even 196 km\/h are possible. In addition, 6.8 seconds are sufficient for the sprint from standstill to 100 km\/h.On the winding country roads of the low mountain region, the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 demonstrates its sporty talent particularly clearly. On wet or dirty roads, the precisely coordinated power distribution of the two engines ensures optimised driving stability. Even when cornering at high speed, any tendency to over- or understeer is prevented at the outset. And on the numerous inclines in the Taunus region, the combined system torque of 385 Nm makes itself felt, allowing the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 to tackle every uphill passage with spirit.If the excursion into the countryside is to be extended into a longer journey, the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 is also a force to be reckoned with. Its high-voltage battery is accommodated under the rear seat bench to save space. This means that there are no comfort restrictions on the three seats in the rear compared to the interior in the conventionally powered model variants of the robust all-rounder. The luggage compartment volume is also only slightly smaller, ranging from 405 to 1,275 litres, so that you can be a little more generous when packing your holiday wardrobe. \n"}

In the, at times, dramatic 12-hour race at Estoril (POR), Xavi Forés (ESP), Markus Reiterberger (GER) and Kenny Foray (FRA) secured third place on the podium as at the Le Mans (FRA) season opener. ->","completion":" Estoril. Second race and a second podium finish for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team and the new #37 BMW M 1000 RR in the FIM Endurance World Championship 2021 (FIM EWC). In the, at times, dramatic 12-hour race at Estoril (POR), Xavi Forés (ESP), Markus Reiterberger (GER) and Kenny Foray (FRA) secured third place on the podium as at the Le Mans (FRA) season opener. Once again they battled their way back up the field impressively after a fall in the opening stage forced the team right down the field to start with. The podium finish was a fitting present for Team Manager Werner Daemen’s 50th birthday. Everything was going perfectly for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team to begin with. Starting from second on the grid, Forés took the lead after just a few minutes. The #37 M RR dropped back into second place briefly after about 50 minutes, but was soon back in front. Reiterberger then extended the lead but after almost two and a half hours of racing Foray skidded while in the lead and fell. He returned the #37 M RR to the pits and after a repair break lasting four and a half minutes it was back to the race. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team was temporarily in 20th place and trailing by four laps, but from there the only way was up. The rest of the race was turbulent at times, with various race leaders dropping right down the field after falls or issues, but went without a hitch for Forés, Reiterberger and Foray and they made up place after place with fast lap times. Forés held the fastest lap time of the whole field for quite some time. After five hours of racing they had worked their way into the top ten. The trio was in sixth place after seven hours, and moved up into fourth place soon after, when two motorbikes in the leading pack collided. That was when the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team set about reducing the margin to the top three. In the final stage the race became something of a real sprint thriller. Ninety minutes before the end the team leading at that time developed a problem which put the podium within realistic reach of the #37 M RR. When all the teams had completed their final pit stops 30 minutes before the chequered flag, Reiterberger, the closing rider, was just ten seconds off the podium. He really went for it and set the team’s fastest race lap in the final stint (just six-thousandths of a second behind the fastest lap overall). Reiterberger closed the gap to two seconds – and just a few minutes before the end of the race, the rider in third place ended up in the gravel. That cleared the path to third place and the second podium finish in a row. After 416 laps, Reiterberger crossed the finish line in third place with the #37 M RR, just 0.976 seconds behind second place. The privateer BMW squad Team LRP Poland finished in 16th place. The riders of the #90 BMW S 1000 RR were Nigel Walraven (NED), Stefan Kerschbaumer (AUT) and Thomas Gradinger (AUT). Quotes after the ‘12 Hours of Estoril’. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Congratulations to the whole team on another fantastic performance. It was a real thriller and history repeated itself. It was similar to Le Mans: leading shortly after the start, then a setback, then moving up the field to finish on the podium. We weren’t quite able to race at our pace in the first stint with the cool track temperatures. Things went really well from the second stint and our pace was definitely good enough to win. Unfortunately, Kenny fell and we dropped down to P20. Everyone did a magnificent job in the ensuing race to catch up. Our pace was really good down to the wire, but realistically we wouldn’t have done better than P4 or P5. But the other teams also experienced a few dramas, so the battle for P2 to P4 was really close in the end. We had to change the brakes, which was planned, but the final two stints from Xavi and Markus were incredibly strong so we really piled the pressure on the rider in third place. To end up finishing in P3 less than one second behind second place – after the fall at the beginning – we have to be pleased with that result. We saw that we had the pace required to win. Now we are in a very good starting position for the rest of the season, and our motto for the Bol d’Or in September is ‘full attack’. After all, we are still in with a chance of winning the world championship. We still have some work to do, but have a very good team, a very good bike, and the potential to become even better. I’d like to thank the team, they did a fantastic job, were great in the pit stops, and I’m happy that we could mark Werner Daemen’s 50th birthday by gifting him this podium.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “What a big day. It was a very exciting day, to be honest. I’m really enjoying my present now. It also was a very difficult day with the crash and some small issues but in the end we got the podium and I am really, really happy. I think the team again did a great job and except for the crash, everything was perfect and we showed again that we are among the top runners in the World Championship. I am sure that soon we can reach the highest step of the podium.” Markus Reiterberger: “Xavi did a great opening stint. I took over being in the lead, was able to extend the gap again and hand over the bike in the lead, too. Unfortunately, Kenny then fell. Initially, that was a setback for us all but we kept our focus and always said that we try to get the best out of it. 12 hours is not as long as 24 hours but we still can achieve something. Xavi did really strong lap times and I then was able, especially in my last stint, to give my everything. The bike worked perfectly for me in cooler conditions. I really pushed and if the race had lasted one lap more, even second place would have been possible. But we made it to the podium and that is the main thing. We are still in the mix in the World Championship.” Xavi Forés: “It was a very tough race. Honestly, after the crash we could not expect to finish on the podium. But we had a really good pace, the bike was working really well, so credit to all the team that worked amazingly to fix the bike in a way that I could get 1:39 times in all my stints. I am really happy with the performance we had all weekend. We have shown that we are really strong and as soon as we can complete the race with no mistakes or issues we will be on the top step. Thank you to the entire team and to Markus and Kenny; they did an amazing job. Now roll on Le Castellet in September.” Kenny Foray: “First of all I want to apologise for my crash. It was a small mistake but it what it is. I am very disappointed about it because I think today it was possible to easily win. The bike was perfect, the tyre, too, and the riders were strong. Especially my team-mates were incredible. I love endurance for that; you never give up and that we could make it to the podium was fantastic. A big thank you to the team, thank you to Xavi and Markus, because it was an incredible effort today.” \n"}
{"prompt":"MINI celebrates 60 years of collaboration with the Cooper Family. Joint commitment for maximum driving pleasure on the road and legendary success in racing. Edition vehicles are produced in a limited edition of 740 units worldwide as MINI Cooper, MINI Cooper S and MINI John Cooper Works. ->","completion":" Munich. The name John Cooper, born 98 years ago today, stands not only for great successes in Formula 1, but also for the traditional sporting spirit of the MINI brand. 60 years ago, John Cooper laid the foundations for a legendary racing victory in the classic Mini. It was the beginning of the collaboration between MINI and the Cooper Family that continues today. The shared tradition stretches from the very first Mini Cooper, launched in September 1961, to the sporty John Cooper Works models in the current model range.To mark the anniversary, the British premium brand is presenting a special edition of the MINI 3-door that combines a return to history with state-of-the-art technology. The MINI Anniversary Edition is a tribute to John Cooper, who passed away in 2000, and a testament to how maximum driving pleasure is enjoyed in his name today, in the premium small car segment.Exclusive design and equipment features make the Anniversary Edition an attractive proposition for MINI fans around the world who are passionate about the brand's sporting history, closely associated with the John Cooper name. The special edition will be available as MINI Cooper 3-door Production is limited globally to just 740 units. The number of units available in this edition refers to the starting number 74, which the classic Mini Cooper wore on its first successful race track appearance.John Cooper earned his status as a racing pioneer as early as the 1950s and with his mid-engine sports cars, he revolutionised Formula 1. His idea, which is still used today, of placing the engine behind the driver instead of in front of him, helped Jack Brabham to secure two world championship titles in 1959 and 1960 in Formula 1 Cooper racing cars. With his penchant for unorthodox solutions, Cooper was similar to his friend and fellow designer Alec Issigonis, who in turn had caused a revolution in the small car segment with the classic Mini. John Cooper immediately recognised the sporting potential of the compact four-seater and initiated the construction of a small series of vehicles with larger brakes and an increased engine output from 34 to 55 hp. The Mini Cooper was born and became an instant success. The Cooper brand and the name lettering surrounded by a red ring now became famous. Two years later, the even more powerful Mini Cooper S followed, which laid the foundation for three overall victories at the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965 and 1967.From then on, Cooper tuning kits for the brand's production vehicles enjoyed growing popularity. And even before the market launch of the modern MINI in 2001, the John Cooper Works brand was created. With this brand, John Michael \"Mike\" Cooper, the son of the Formula 1 team boss, continued the cooperation with MINI.Since 2008, John Cooper Works models have been at the top of the MINI range as top athletes - now with up to 225 kW\/306 hp and suspension technology developed with racing know-how. The joint sporting career of MINI and John Cooper Works has been obvious in recent times by six overall successes in the Dakar Rally. In the latest generation, Charlie Cooper contributes, as a racing driver and brand ambassador, to continue the collaboration between his family and MINI.Nuances of the shared history of MINI and the Cooper Family can be found both on the exterior and in the interior of the new edition vehicles. As early racing cars designed by John Cooper were recognisable by their green paintwork with white accents, the MINI Anniversary Editions are offered in British Racing Green metallic. Alternatively, Midnight Black metallic variant is available, and for MINI John Cooper Works the Rebel Green body colour is also offered. All paint finishes are combined with a roof, exterior mirror caps, door handles and surrounds for the headlights and rear lights in white. Other exterior trim elements are offered in Piano Black high gloss.These exterior features are complemented by white bonnet stripes and a red accent line, a number 74 on the bonnet and doors of the edition vehicles, is reminiscent of the start of a sporting career, as the classic Mini Cooper once wore the starting number 74 when it won its first class on the racetrack.The MINI Anniversary Edition combines the contents of the John Cooper Works Trim with model exclusive features that emphasise the sporty character and the awareness of the historical roots. For example, the suspension with frequency-selective damping is supplemented by 18-inch John Cooper Works light-alloy wheels in Circuit Spoke 2-tone design. The \"COOPER\" name logo can be found on the door sill trims, on the side scuttles, on the C-pillars and on the center spoke of the Nappa sports leather steering wheel.The interior equipment of the edition includes John Cooper Works sports seats in Dinamica\/leather Carbon Black finish, an anthracite-coloured headliner, stainless steel pedal set and interior trim in Piano Black high-gloss. The red ring from the original John Cooper logo adorns the luggage compartment lid and the interior surface on the passenger side. On the driver's side, the interior surface features the signatures of John, Mike and Charlie Cooper. As a further indication of the exclusive character of the edition, the inside of the driver's door frame features an emblem with John Cooper's signature, the handwritten note \"1 of 740\" and the words \"60 YEARS OF MINI COOPER - THE UNEXPECTED UNDERDOG\".The exclusive and sporty look of the edition vehicles can be rounded off with selected retrofit options from the Original MINI Accessories range. The MINI Waistline Finisher in Piano Black completes the attractive contrast between black and white trim elements on the exterior. Other options include a MINI Sport aerial and tailpipe trims in carbon finish. Punched and slotted John Cooper Works brake discs are also available for the MINI John Cooper Works in the Anniversary Edition. \n"}

The second edition of the Berlin Brawl took the United in Rivalry teams supported by BMW and their fans back in time. On Monday, players from G2 Esports, FNATIC, OG Esports and FunPlus Phoenix met at LVL World of Gaming in Berlin (GER) and entered unfamiliar territory. Instead of showing off their skills in League of Legends, Dota 2 or Valorant, they entered the world of arcade games and duelled each other in three cult classics from the 1980s: Vulgus, Strider and Street Fighter II Turbo. Victory went to FNATIC, as it did last year. In keeping with the ethos of the Berlin Brawl, hosted by Eefje Depoortere, as Official Automotive Partner at LVL World of Gaming, BMW showcased a real cult car, the Ken Done BMW M3 Art Car from 1989. “This Berlin Brawl with a retro look reminded us once again that the obsession with Esports and gaming is not a new phenomenon, it has decades of tradition,” said Ingmar Johannsen, Head of BMW Esports. “Congratulations to Bwipo and FNATIC, who had also edged it against G2 Esports at the Brawl premiere in 2020. Once again LVL World of Gaming was a fantastic stage for our United in Rivalry derby. It’s fantastic that this event got our collaboration as Official Automotive Partner off to a spectacular start. At times there were more than 12,000 viewers following the Berlin Brawl at the same time on Twitch. The response from the community was very positive. Thank you to all teams who got involved in this journey to the 1980s.” BMW Esports teams were represented by the players Caps, Mikyx (both G2 Esports), Bean, Bwipo (both FNATIC), N0tail (OG Esports) and ANGE1 (FunPlus Phoenix) in Berlin. The challenge was to modify their skills perfected for modern games to suit three cult classics. Bwipo was the most successful, beating Caps in the final. To celebrate both the arcade game era in the 1980s and the new partnership between BMW and LVL World of Gaming, the BMW M3 Art Car of artist Ken Done from 1989 was on display in Berlin. There is a long tradition of BMW Art Cars. From the 1970s to today, world-famous artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Jeff Koons have immortalized themselves with their designs on BMW racing and road cars. The BMW M3 made its debut in 1987, the same year that the Vulgus game was released, and the first Street Fighter. Street Fighter II Turbo followed in 1992, the same year in which the second-generation BMW M3 was launched. As part of the Berlin Brawl, BMW also gave fans the opportunity to get further acquainted with The Rival Rig, which had made its debut at the BMW Esports Boost at the end of June.

The BMW X7 edition in Frozen Black metallic combines impressive options into an exclusive package.In 2020 alone and with almost 250,000 units sold worldwide, the SAV\/SAC trio from Spartanburg, USA, contributed decisively towards the success of the BMW brand. Around every eighth newly delivered BMW model was a BMW X5, X6 or X7.All three edition models go on sale with all engines available for each of their original models. They can be ordered with immediate effect, with the market launch beginning in August 2021. Prices in Germany start at 93,200 Euros for the BMW X5 Black Vermilion, 100,700 Euros for the BMW X6 Black Vermilion and 108,700 Euros for the BMW X7 in Frozen Black metallic (each including 19% sales tax).Particularly striking: BMW X5 and X6 Black Vermilion edition. The central focus of the Black Vermilion edition is the interplay between the colours black and red. For example, the BMW double kidney grille with model-specific red bars creates an effective contrast to the BMW Individual special paint finish Frozen Black metallic. On the BMW X6 Black Vermilion this visual highlight is expressed in a particularly impressive way in combination with its kidney grille Iconic Glow. The M headlights Shadow Line with BMW laser light, including accented lighting with blue X signature, complete the distinctive look of the front end. Moreover, on the exterior, the M Sport Package emphasises the dynamic character of the BMW X5 and X6 Black Vermilion editions. It comprises, among other things, specific front and rear aprons as well as the M high-gloss Shadow Line with extended options. Behind the Orbit Grey matt, 22-inch, double-spoke 742 M light alloy wheels with mixed tyres designed exclusively for these edition models, red high-gloss M Sport brake callipers stand out as a striking visual highlight.In the interior of the BMW X5 and BMW X6 Black Vermilion editions the M Alcantara Anthracite roof liner provides for an exceptionally sophisticated ambience. A finely crafted Edition logo on the cupholder cover in BMW Individual black piano finish emphasises the limited model’s exclusiveness. The glass application Crafted Clarity on the iDrive Controller, the automatic gear selector and Start\/Stop button, as well as the BMW Individual precious wood interior trim Fineline Black with aluminium inlays provide additional sophisticated accents. Driver and front seat passenger travel in comfort seats offering a multitude of adjustment options. The BMW Individual full leather trim Merino Black is additionally enhanced by edition-specific red contrast stitching for both the driver’s seat and front passenger seat. Inside the BMW X5 Black Vermilion, the red accents are also to be found on the rear seats. Likewise, the edging on both the front and rear floor mats is finished in red. Sun-protective glass with more deeply tinted rear windows beyond the B-pillar enhances passenger privacy whilst blending in harmoniously with the sporty and dynamic exterior design.BMW X7 edition in Frozen Black metallic – individual and expressive.Like the Black Vermilion editions, the new BMW X7 edition also has the BMW Individual special paint finish Frozen Black metallic, dispensing, however, with details in contrasting colour. The BMW M Sport brake callipers of the edition-specific, 22-inch BMW Individual Y-spoke 758 I alloy wheels in Orbit Grey matt are finished in high gloss black. Combined with the M Sport Package and the M High Gloss Shadow Line with extended options, it is this colour restraint in particular that make the 5.15-metre long and over 2-metre wide seven-seater look even more impressive. The interior of the BMW X7 edition in Frozen Black metallic provides for an elegantly discreet atmosphere thanks to the M Alcantara Anthracite roof liner, the glass application Crafted Clarity and sun-protection glass.\n"}
{"prompt":"New design feature, unique in the competitive environment, is offered for the MINI 3-door, the MINI 5-door and the MINI Clubman. Innovative painting process at the MINI plant in Oxford enables a three-colour design of the roof, which sets visual accents in the typical style of the British premium brand. ->","completion":" Munich. MINI has a long tradition of colour diversity. A contrasting paint finish for the roof once helped the classic Mini to achieve a particularly expressive appearance and has continued to set attractive visual accents in various colour tones since the launch of the modern MINI 20 years ago. With the exclusive Multitone Roof, the individualisation of the MINI exterior achievable by means of paintwork now reaches a whole new dimension. For the first time, an innovative wet-on-wet painting process is being used at the MINI plant in Oxford, UK, to create a three-colour design for the vehicle roof.The pioneer for the innovative form of roof design is the MINI Cooper SE For the first time, the Multitone Roof was offered as part of the MINI Electric Collection for the British premium brand's all-electric model, which was presented alongside the world premiere of the latest new edition of MINI's small car models. In the meantime, the Multitone Roof, which is unique worldwide in the mass production of automobiles, is available as an optional extra for both the premium small cars MINI 3-door and MINI 5-door as well as for the MINI Clubman, which is successful in the premium compact segment.The visual highlight of the new design feature is the flowing gradient between the three colour tones selected for the Multitone Roof. From the dark San Marino Blue in the front section of the vehicle's roof, the colour scheme gently transitions to the lighter shade of Pearly Aqua, then just as smoothly to Jet Black in the rear section. The unique aesthetic created by this colour gradient is also easily recognisable in conjunction with the optional panoramic glass roof as well as the optional roof rails. The colour scheme of the Multitone Roof forms an interplay that is as appealing as it is harmonious with almost all the body paint finishes available for the MINI 3-door, the MINI 5-door and the MINI Clubman. It is therefore available in combination with all exterior colours with the exception of the Chili Red uni and British Racing Green metallic variants as well as the Indian Summer Red metallic available for the MINI Clubman.With the contrasting paint for the roof, the characteristic three-part division of the MINI body is emphasised particularly intensively. The horizontal structure of vehicle body, glass passenger cell and roof is a design principle typical of the brand. The design of the roof becomes an expression of personal style. Depending on the model variant, contrasting paint finishes in white, black and silver are offered as optional equipment ex works. A red-painted roof is also available for the John Cooper Works models. In addition, the MINI Original Accessories range includes roof decors in various designs - from the Union Jack to the Checkered Flag design - for retrofitting.The expansion of the range of contrasting paint finishes to include the Multitone Roof is made possible by the introduction of a new type of painting technique at the British MINI plant in Oxford. There, the light colour Pearly Aqua is first applied to the roof of the correspondingly configured vehicles. In further steps, San Marino Blue is applied to the front of the roof and Jet Black to the rear, creating the flowing colour gradients characteristic of the Multitone Roof. The innovative painting process is fully integrated into the automated production process at the MINI plant in Oxford. Nevertheless, slight deviations in the colour pattern occur due to changing environmental conditions, so that each MINI with a Multitone Roof is already given the character of a unique specimen by the painting process at the factory . \n"}

A good Saturday was followed by a great Sunday at Donington Park (GBR). BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team celebrated the first three podiums in the FIM Superbike World Championship for the new BMW M 1000 RR. In the morning’s Superpole race, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) finished second and third to record a double podium, while Sykes finished third in the afternoon’s second main race to reach the rostrum once again. Van der Mark crossed the finish line in a good fifth place. Donington Park hosted round four of the 2021 WorldSBK season. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had laid the foundations for Sunday’s success in Superpole qualifying on Saturday, as van der Mark and Sykes began the Superpole race in the morning from second and third places on the grid. Rain showers made a brief appearance before the sprint race but the circuit dried out quickly. In common with much of the field, both BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team riders went with intermediate tyres. They both initially dropped back by one place on the first lap but regained those positions on lap two and did not surrender them thereafter. After ten laps, Sykes finished second and van der Mark third to secure not just the first WorldSBK podium for the new M RR, but a double podium finish. As the Superpole race decided the grid for race two that afternoon, they had a great start position with both riders back on the front row again, Sykes in second and van der Mark in third. Sykes exited the first turns in third place, staying in touch with leading duo Jonathan Rea (GBR \/ Kawasaki) and Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR \/ Yamaha). Sykes dropped back to fourth place for a short while around the halfway point of the race, but the BMW rider moved back to third after a fall for leader Rea. He then defended until the chequered flag was waved after 23 laps - celebrating his second podium finish of the day. Van der Mark lost ground at the start but moved back into fifth place on lap 16 to secure another top five finish. Eugene Laverty (IRL) crossed the finish line in twelfth place in the Superpole race on the BMW M 1000 RR of BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse. He finished 15th in race two, scoring another world championship point. Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing claimed 16th place in the morning’s sprint race. He then retired early from the afternoon race as the quickshifter did not work properly. Quotes after race two at Donington Park. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We are very happy. It’s very good to get this under the belt, it takes away a bit of the pressure when we focus on the next rounds. As I said yesterday, there is still some work to do. I was hoping for some rain today but it didn’t come in the afternoon. So it was very, very good to confirm our performance in a full dry race on slicks as we were definitely not as competitive in such conditions in the last race and also at the beginning of this weekend. Overall, to come away with three podiums is of course very, very pleasing. This is something we can build on. Crucial for this weekend was definitely our Superpole qualifying because if you look at the pace of the others you know that you could easily be sixth, seventh or eighth if you are not in that front row. Now it’s time to settle down, look at the data, gather our thoughts and make the next step.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a fantastic day. It’s our home track, the home round for Tom and us, so it was a sensational day for all. I think we stepped up. We’ve come back from a really disappointing Misano round, we have reacted. In the sprint race, there were changeable conditions and almost everyone went for intermediate tyres which was the right decision. Then in race two, with dry conditions, all started on slicks and it shows the step we have made with the BMW M 1000 RR. We were literally a few seconds off the win. We always were in contention for the podium and Tom did a fantastic race and Michael was not far behind him. He withstood the pressure from Alex Lowes on the Kawasaki and brought the bike home in a strong fifth. Now we all are looking forward to Michael’s home round at Assen.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Credit to the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. We have come here, tried to just assess the situation after the Navarra test and really, I am happy. I was training at the beginning of the week and when I came to my house and got off my pushbike, I knew: this is the weekend. Considering what we learned at Navarra I would be going to drag the thing around Donington Park if I have to. On Friday, I was pushing the boundaries and went to the deck twice. Normally I ride to the limit and stop just like I did today in the race. The guys did an incredible job, giving me a perfect bike in terms of what we had available in our tool box so I think we got the best from our package this weekend. Still, we need to improve but this is a whole confidence boost for the team and me. It gives everyone what they deserve. And what’s really nice is that we had two BMWs, myself and Michael, on the front row in wet conditions and then with the intermediates in tricky conditions, we were on the podium again - both BMWs, second and third. Then in that last race, it was tricky in the beginning but ultimately a dry race on a different rear tyre. I am not really sure if I am happy with the tyre I chose but we dug deep and the tyre gave us a podium so for this I am happy. Hopefully now we can continue with the information we have and try to keep improving.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We had a really good Sunday. It was nice this morning in the Superpole race. The track was a little bit tricky so early everyone went on intermediates and it was the right choice. I really enjoyed it. It was good to finish on the podium together with Tom. Then in race two I had quite a good feeling but I just struggled too much in changing directions; I lost a lot of time there compared to the other guys. But in the end, we finished fifth so we have a lot of valuable points and it was nice to have Tom on the podium again.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “It was a pretty difficult weekend here at Donington Park. I had high hopes for here because I know the character of the BMW M 1000 RR is well suited to the majority of the flowing Donington track but we never had a good feeling this weekend. That has been the case with the bike since my big crash at Misano so now we have to investigate if there is some damage from the bike from the crash that hasn’t still been recognized because it’s impossible to be so slow this weekend when we see what the official BMWs were doing. We should be there together with them. So let’s investigate and come back stronger.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was a difficult weekend and I am sorry for the entire team that we find ourselves in this situation. Right now, we are searching for solutions that we have not yet been able to find. I hope that things will improve soon and we can make progress.” \n"}

Both riders crossed the finish line in the top five in the afternoon’s first race. Sykes was in fourth and van der Mark in fifth. The weather at Donington Park took a typically British turn on Saturday morning. Rain set in for the second free practice session in the morning and the circuit was still moist for Superpole. That did not prevent van der Mark and Sykes from recording some impressive times to keep pace with the leaders, putting both BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team BMW M 1000 RRs on the front row of the grid. The rain had stopped by the time the race started in the afternoon and the circuit was gradually drying. Van der Mark and Sykes were able to defend second and third positions after the start lights went out. They swapped places twice in the opening stage, before settling into third (van der Mark) and fourth (Sykes) until the halfway point of the race. Both were part of a group battling for the lead on lap twelve, but then van der Mark had light contact with Alex Lowes (GBR \/ Kawasaki), ran wide and fell back to sixth place. Sykes initially moved into third place before crossing the line in fourth, immediately ahead of fifth-placed van der Mark, after 23 laps. Eugene Laverty (IRL), competing for the BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse, secured 15th place on the grid in Superpole. Laverty had moved up to twelfth by the halfway point of the race. He then dropped down one place in the closing stage and took the chequered flag in 13th position. Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing endured a difficult Saturday. He started from 20th place and then problems when changing gear forced him to head for the pits and retire just before the end of the race. Quotes after race one at Donington Park. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Overall, we are very happy after an extremely difficult Misano weekend. At the same time, we need to keep our feet on the ground as there is still quite a big gap to the very front. But for sure, second and third places in qualifying were well deserved with strong performances of both Michael and Tom in the wet. Of course, we would have hoped for a podium as the first half of the race looked like it but we just couldn’t keep that. To bring home fourth and fifth is definitely satisfying. Tomorrow is another day and we start again from the front row of the grid. It looks like it will rain tomorrow but if we can repeat what we did today I would be very pleased with the weekend.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We were glad first of all that it was a slick race for everybody. We would rather be it be totally wet or totally dry. We were at a good level, and we could show the progress we have made with the new BMW M 1000 RR. We can’t be disappointed with fourth and fifth; we equalled our best result as a team from Aragón. For sure we would have liked to go one step further but the guys gave their best. We got a lot of information that we can take into tomorrow. Obviously, we start from the same grid positions into the Superpole race and if all goes well we can get that step closer to the podium and keep progressing the development of the BMW M 1000 RR.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am definitely happy that the BMW M 1000 RR was working well in the full wet conditions. In that in-between condition at the beginning of the race, we just struggled to get into it. We could not get the same grip as everyone else but the bike stayed very, very consistent so we were just missing a couple of tenths. We did not have a full dry set-up. Who would have thought that the sun comes out? So we maybe missed out in that respect but fourth position is not too bad. I’m okay with that and obviously we will try to improve tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Today was not bad. In Superpole, on the wet track, I felt really good and we managed to put both BMWs on the front row. That’s always a good thing. For the race, the track started to slowly dry. My start was quite okay and then I was just trying to find my line. I was making a couple of mistakes going down to Craner Curves, going onto the wet with the slicks so I lost a lot of time there a couple of times. That was a bit of a shame but anyway, there is a lot to improve on the bike for sure for tomorrow but I think we can be satisfied with P5 today.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “In the race, the conditions dried up and unfortunately, while I went with dry tyres we weren’t able to change to the dry setting. So in the end I was riding with a wet suspension setting and it was impossible to do good lap times. That was the maximum I could do today, so hopefully tomorrow it is either clearly wet or clearly dry because when it is like that, there isn’t time to change and it’s a bit difficult for a smaller team like us. But, we start again tomorrow.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “There’s not much to say today. I just didn’t feel right today. Now we have to find out what caused that. We can only hope that it goes better tomorrow.” \n"}

One year has passed since Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) suffered severe injuries in a handbike accident in Italy in June 2020. It has been a year in which the BMW brand ambassador is once more showing his fighting spirit and is working his way back, even if it is a long way. In this interview, his wife Daniela Zanardi reports on his recovery process. Daniela, how is Alex these days? Daniela Zanardi: “One year after the accident, Alex’s condition is essentially stable. He is currently in a special clinic, where he is undergoing a rehabilitation programme. This includes multimodal and pharmacological stimulations under the guidance of doctors, physiotherapists, neuropsychologists and speech therapists to try to facilitate his recovery.” A long time has passed since the last update on Alex’s health. Is there a specific reason for this release? Zanardi: “We have received so many best wishes for his recovery, and I would like to take this opportunity to say a big thank you, on behalf of Alex, for every single message. Following consultations with the doctors, now appears to be an appropriate time to offer this small insight into Alex’s recovery process with this interview. I would like to tell all those people who are thinking of and praying for Alex that he is fighting – as he always has done. The affection we have received from friends, fans, acquaintances, athletes and those involved in motorsport over the past year has been nothing short of touching and overwhelming and has been of enormous support for us in dealing with all this. However, a very special thank you goes to the medical personnel.” How can you describe Alex’s development since the accident? Zanardi: “It has been a very complex process that has required more neurosurgery and been characterised by a number of setbacks. Alex is in a stable condition, which means he is able to undergo training programmes for both his brain and his body. He can communicate with us, but he is still unable to speak. After a long time in a coma, the vocal cords must regain their elasticity. This is only possible through practice and therapy. He still has a lot of strength in his arms and hands, and is training intensively on the equipment.” What are your expectations for the future? Zanardi: “It is certainly another huge challenge. It is a very long journey and at the moment no predictions are made on when he will be able to return home. We put all our energy in Alex’s recovery. Therefore we decided to use this interview as a unique opportunity to inform the public on his recovery status and answer some frequently asked questions. We appreciate everyone’s understanding that we will leave it at that for the moment.” \n"}

An international jury selected him unanimously from a shortlist of three artists represented by galleries who were originally selected for this year’s Art Basel in Hong Kong. Julien Creuzet is represented by the gallery High Art, Paris. The BMW Art Journey is part of BMW Group’s global cultural engagement celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Committed in the fields of modern and contemporary art, classical music, jazz and sound as well as architecture and design, the BMW Group has been an integral part of culture on a global scale.For Julien Creuzet, a member of the Caribbean diaspora in Paris, the BMW Art Journey – the tenth in the series – will mark a return to his ancestral home, a place he calls “the heart of my imagination.” In a poetic journey that intertwines personal discovery with profound environmental concern and a generous spirit of sharing, he will center his travels around a geographically and culturally distinct region. In Martinique, he will work closely with a community of art students from Fort-de-France, as well as musicians and filmmakers. His plans include creating hybrid sculptures of Antillean fauna as well as plastic and industrial objects, in a gesture of circularity. In Guadeloupe, he will film underwater scenes as well as obtain aerial visuals with drones. Often neglected in the metropolitan imagination, the Antilles are not just homeland for Creuzet but a site inviting consideration of the legacies of colonialism, conflict, and marginalization. During his journey, Creuzet will meet with cultural actors and collect visual materials and music for a “Caribbean road movie” that merges fiction and documentary, augmented by poetry and 3-D art.“I am really excited to be the winner of the BMW Art Journey: It is a great chance to reconnect with the heart of my imagination and my Native land. This journey will allow me to collaborate with local artists, writers, poets, musicians, students and then setting up a real environment in Martinique,” says Julien Creuzet.Members of the international expert jury are Claire Hsu, Director, Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong; Matthias Mühling, Director, Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau, Munich; Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, President, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin; Philip Tinari, Director, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing; and Samson Young, artist and winner of the first BMW Art Journey. “Julien Creuzet’s journey is not a trip to a distant and unknown destination, but rather a return to a familiar place – a place of family, youth, and education,” the jury noted, reaching its unanimous decision. “The project rethinks mobility, the climate crisis, and societal shifts in the wake of Covid-19. Focusing on a single location, Creuzet underscores the importance of the local and of reconnecting with one’s roots. His journey combines histories with fantasies, and ancestral connections with cosmopolitanism. We were impressed by the generosity of his project, how it makes space for other artists – a gesture of care and humility that’s in keeping with our healing moment.”In addition to Julien Creuzet, the shortlisted artists for the BMW Art Journey 2021 were: Kelvin Kyun Kun Park (represented by Vanguard Gallery, Shanghai) and Alice Wang (represented by Capsule Shanghai).Launched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging artists worldwide. Since 2020, the circle of eligible artists has broadened and includes not only emerging and mid-career artists from the Discoveries sector, but also artists represented by galleries founded no more than ten years ago at Art Basel’s show in Hong Kong. In recognition of the ongoing exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic, the international expert jury conducted its selection process online. The selected artists were then invited to submit proposals for a journey aimed to further develop their artistic work. Based on these proposals the winner was selected. Julien Creuzet plans to start his BMW Art Journey in summer 2021.Past winners of the BMW Art Journey include sound and performance artist Samson Young (presented by a.m. Space, Hong Kong at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2015); video artists Henning Fehr and Philipp Rühr (presented by Galerie Max Mayer, Dusseldorf at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2015); Abigail Reynolds (presented by Rokeby, London at Art Basel's show in Hong Kong in 2016) as well as Max Hooper Schneider (presented by High Art, Paris at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2016), Astha Butail (represented by GALLERYSKE, New Dehli, Bangalore at Art Basel´s Hong Kong show in 2017), Jamal Cyrus (represented by Inman Gallery, Houston at Art Basel’s Miami Beach show in 2017), Zac Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland at Art Basel’s Hong Kong show in 2018), Lu Yang (represented by the gallery Société, Berlin at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2019) and Leelee Chan (represented by Capsule Shanghai at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2021).BMW has supported Art Basel’s shows in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong Kong for many years.For further information about the artists and their projects, please visit: www.bmw-art-journey.com \n"}

Viktor Hovland, one of the top favourites coming into the tournament, lived up to his billing in style and starts Sunday’s final round with a three-shot lead at the top of the leaderboard. Vincent Norrman holed his tee shot on the 16th hole . “It is incredible. Unfortunately, that shot came one hole too early,” said the Swede, referring to the BMW iX on offer for an ace on the 17th hole. “I think BMW should put the Hole-in-One Award on the 16th hole in the future. The hole is harder to hit – you deserve a BMW for that.”Kaymer was in touch with the leaders at the start of his round, but a double-bogey on the 16th, after a poor third shot landed in the water, cost him a better position. Despite this, the two-time major winner was still satisfied and said: “It was very solid for 17 holes. I just dropped two or three shots on the rest of the field on one hole. With a par, I would have been right in the tournament. However, I am focussing on the big picture. I have played three solid rounds and given myself a lot of chances. I will need a 7 or 8 under to be up there challenging tomorrow. That is possible, but you have to avoid making those odd errors here and there.”The positive surprise of the tournament remains the only amateur in the field. Matthias Schmid hit another impressive round of 69. The 22-year-old is at one with himself and has a healthy self-confidence. “I am playing the same game as everyone else, so I believe I can achieve something tomorrow. I will try to play a good round, then we’ll see what happens,” said Schmid.\n"}

After four extremely exciting hours of racing, a dream came true for the BMW Junior Team, its first overall victory on the Nordschleife with the BMW M6 GT3. Neil Verhagen (USA), Max Hesse (GER) and Dan Harper (GBR) won race four of the 2021 Nürburgring Endurance Series. A brilliant performance saw them prevail against stiff opposition, making them the youngest team in the history of endurances races to win at the Nürburgring (GER). Harper laid the foundation for this success in morning qualifying when he secured second place on the grid for the #44 BMW M6 GT3. Verhagen was first behind the wheel in the race, and kept the trio on course for a podium finish from the opening lap. During Hesse’s stint, some of the lap times he set were five seconds quicker than his closest rivals. A drive-through penalty, which the team received two hours into the race following a collision at the start, initially saw the team drop back through the field. However, this was to be just a brief setback. With a good one and a half hours remaining, Harper moved to the head of the field in the #44 BMW M6 GT3. He then defended his lead superbly in a thrilling duel with the second-placed Audi. When both cars came in for their final pit stop at the same time, roughly 40 minutes from the end of the race, the Audi briefly took the lead. However, it only took Harper a few corners to retake the lead, as the team cheered on. After four hours of racing, the #44 BMW M6 GT3 crossed the finish line in first place. The car was run by BMW Team RMG. “That was a fantastic race,” said mentor Jochen Neerpasch, who was spellbound as he followed the action in the garage. “In the 24-hour race the boys showed that they belong in the top class. However, they graduated in style here today. It was an outstanding performance. It was not gifted to them, but was a very tough race. The way they withstood the pressure was impressive. That is by no means a matter of course at this young age. The BMW Juniors have shown once again how well they work together as a team.” “I am just super, super happy. This is a dream come true for us all,” said Hesse. “We worked hard all year and, unfortunately, were not rewarded with the result our effort deserved. I believe we have now paid the team back a little. The guys really put their foot down. A big thank you also goes to Augusto Farfus, without whom we certainly would not be here now. We are just happy and want to continue this way.” “Max and Dan did an amazing job; BMW Team RMG and BMW M Motorsport did an amazing job as well for the great car we had,” added Verhagen. “We just got our heads down, we got into it, we also were able to get through the drive-through penalty and bring it back into the lead again. It was very impressive. Being the youngest overall winners on the Nordschleife is something super special. It has been amazing.” Harper said of his final one-and-a-half-hour stint, which developed into a thrilling sprint to the finish: “There was just full push from the very beginning as soon as I got into the car. I had the Audi right behind me. The whole way through, those one and a half hours, it was very intense. There was a couple of wild moments on the grass but I am just so proud of the whole team, BMW Team RMG, BMW M Motorsport and of course my team-mates Max and Neil. From last year, when the programme started to now we have come so far together and I think this is a bit of a fairy tale. I just hope that we can step onto the top step of the podium many more times together.” The Nordschleife season continues for Harper, Hesse and Verhagen on 10th and 11th July, with races five and six of this season’s Nürburgring Endurance Series. \n"}

The race debut of the BMW M4 GT3 has had to be postponed. The plan was for the new race car to take part in round four of the 2021 Nürburgring Endurance Series, on Saturday on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), but this has had to be cancelled at short notice. The car suffered damage in a crash during the closing stages of the test and set-up session on Friday evening and could not be repaired overnight. BMW M Motorsport is currently analysing the cause of the crash in detail. Up to this point, the intense week of testing with the BMW M4 GT3 had run smoothly. On Monday and Tuesday, BMW M Motorsport had the opportunity to take part in the official SRO tests ahead of the 24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). After the new car’s first outing at the Belgian circuit, BMW M Motorsport drew an extremely positive conclusion in all areas. Augusto Farfus (BRA), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) alternated behind the wheel at Spa-Francorchamps. From the Ardennes, the BMW M4 GT3 headed straight to the Eifel region of Germany, where Jens Klingmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) took over in the cockpit. Friday’s test and set-up drives on the Grand Prix Circuit and Nürburgring-Nordschleife were also going very well until the crash, which occurred shortly before the end of the session. A technical issue resulted in Van der Linde losing control of the car and crashing into the barriers. “It is a great shame that our test week with the BMW M4 GT3, which had been very successful up until that point, ended prematurely – and that we have had to postpone the car’s race debut, to which we were all very much looking forward,” said Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport. “The impact caused damage to the car and so we decided to withdraw from the NLS race on Saturday. We did not take this decision lightly. However, our priority now is to find out exactly what caused the crash. It is not uncommon to have a technical issue in the development phase of a new car. That is precisely what these intensive tests are for: to identify potential weaknesses during the development phase, and to eliminate these for the future. That is what we will do now.” Generally speaking, the BMW M4 GT3, the new flagship in the BMW M Motorsport range, once again impressed in terms of driveability and handling at Spa-Francorchamps and on the Nordschleife. “Friday was our second outing with the BMW M4 GT3 on the Nordschleife, and I felt very comfortable in the car from the first lap,” said Klingmann. “It definitely confirmed the positive impression I got last time, and the further development since then has certainly made the car even better. Clear progress has been made with the BMW M4 GT3 in the sections, in which the BMW M6 GT3 was weaker. At the same time, it has retained the strengths of the M6. I am feeling very positive: the car feels good and gives you a lot of confidence from the first lap.” Yelloly, who set the fastest time with the BMW M4 GT3 during the test at Spa-Francorchamps, agreed: “We did a lot of driving in the rain on day one, while the second day was dry. That gave us the opportunity to complete a lot of laps with the BMW M4 GT3 in all conditions. The car felt fantastic, ran like clockwork, and the balance is outstanding. We completed a lot of test work in a wide range of areas at Spa-Francorchamps. The fact that we set the fastest time was obviously a nice bonus.” \n"}

Two-time major winner Martin Kaymer also worked his way up the leaderboard and is still very much in contention to win the most prestigious golf tournament in Germany for a second time, having previously triumphed in 2008. Amateur Matthias Schmid made the cut for the first time at a European Tour event, after which he said confidently: “You play to win”.After rounds of 68 and 67, Hovland is one of the chasing pack just two shots behind leader Kearney and is visibly enjoying himself at his first BMW International Open. “It’s still a little wet out there, but the course is holding up great. Even playing in the afternoon, the greens are still great. You can make a lot of putts, which I did today. I just have to continue playing this way at the weekend.”Kaymer made a dream start to his second round and was five under par for the day after nine holes. He carded three bogeys on the back nine, but bounced back each time with a birdie on the following hole. The 36-year-old has his trainer Günter Kessler at his side this week, and said: “My trainer must have earned me four or five shots this week. I hit a lot of good tee shots, which had been an issue in recent weeks. We have done a lot of practice on the driving range. That is why I hit a lot of fairways and reached the green on some par-four holes in one.”Louis Oosthuizen is another top-class player who has moved into a promising position ahead of the weekend. The South African, who narrowly missed out on his second major title at the US Open last Sunday, carded a round of 67 on Friday. Oosthuizen put his change in fortunes since yesterday retired with an injury.\n"}
{"prompt":"Sim racers have been able to contest races with the development model of the new BMW M4 GT3 on iRacing since the start of the year. Now, the simulation platform has released an upgrade of the car with the latest BMW M Motorsport design.  ->","completion":" Munich. Sim racers have been able to contest races with the development model of the new BMW M4 GT3 on iRacing since the start of the year. Now, the simulation platform has released an upgrade of the car with the latest BMW M Motorsport design. This version of the BMW M4 GT3 comes very close to the handling of the real car which is set to make its race debut next Saturday. This is the result of very close, intensive collaboration between BMW works driver Bruno Spengler (CAN) and the iRacing developers during the further development in recent months. About six months after the virtual BMW M4 GT3 made its debut on iRacing the upgrade of the car is due to be launched. This was worked on by Spengler in collaboration with Chris Lerch (USA), the head Vehicle Dynamics Engineer for the simulation platform, and an internal iRacing test driver. The team focussed primarily on working on the driving physics, chassis and optimisations in selected aerodynamic areas. “The aim was to make the handling as similar to that of the real car as possible,” explained Spengler. The BMW works driver was the perfect point of contact for this as he has already tested the real-world BMW M4 GT3 himself and is also an experienced sim racer who has already brought home countless wins and titles on iRacing. “Bruno’s input was invaluable to this project,“ said Lerch. “His test drives and his feedback advanced the development from start to finish. We are extremely grateful to him for his input.” The basis for the further development of the virtual BMW M4 GT3 in recent months was first and foremost Spengler’s subjective driving experience. The iRacing developers used the comprehensive vehicle data that they received from BMW M Motorsport last year to convert Spengler’s very detailed feedback into actual numbers for the upgrade. That is how the team went from one version of the BMW M4 GT3 to the next, until it was as realistic as possible from Spengler’s perspective. The iRacing test driver was tasked with collecting his impressions, which help classify the car correctly in the balance of performance that is crucial for GT3 races. And Lerch contributed the perspective of a hobby sim racer, as the aim is for the BMW M4 GT3 to be very drivable for that level as well. “It was a cool challenge bringing sim racing and real-world racing together like this,” summed up Spengler. “The collaboration with iRacing was fantastic and was a lot of fun. From my perspective, the virtual BMW M4 GT3 is now very like the real thing. I’m excited to hear what the sim racers have to say.” The real-world BMW M4 GT3 is set to make its race debut in the new BMW M Motorsport design next Saturday, in the Nürburgring Endurance Series. The same design is now available to all sim racers on iRacing.\n"}

However, Kaymer feels there is still room for improvement, particularly on the greens. “I had a lot of chances today, but struggled to get the ball in the hole.

Unfortunately, I missed the odd putt here and there. However, I am satisfied. It was a solid performance.”Hovland returned to the clubhouse with a more colourful scorecard, which featured an eagle but also two bogeys. “On the whole, it was good, but a hit a few poor shots – unfortunately, on the par 5 and the short par 4, where I found the water. There are a lot of birdie opportunities on this course, but I have to stop hitting it in the water.”Bernd Wiesberger (AUT, -5) ended the round in tenth place, setting himself up nicely for the next three days.

{"prompt":"Tourism is picking up again on the largest island of the Balearic Islands. The possibilities for active leisure activities are as varied as the landscape and beach life. They make the Spanish holiday paradise a popular destination not only for cyclists, tennis players and sailors, but also for motor sports enthusiasts. ->","completion":" Munich. Almost 14 million tourists were counted on the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca in 2019. Due to the recent travel restrictions, the rush of visitors was slowed down considerably in the meantime, but now the holidaymakers are returning. There is no shortage of reasons for this. Some long for relaxation on the beach or in luxurious hotel complexes, for some the party atmosphere at Playa de Palma is the focus of interest, and still others swear by \"the other Mallorca\". Lonely bays, unspoilt landscapes and small, unspoilt villages away from the tourist strongholds can be found in almost all regions of Mallorca, as a round trip of the island in the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman shows. With its storage space that can be expanded from 360 to up to 1 250 litres, the extremely sporty premium compact model offers enough room for holiday luggage and, with ALL4 all-wheel drive as standard, is also confidently on the move where a particularly beautiful stretch of beach can only be reached via unpaved roads or gravel tracks.The standard equipment of the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman not only includes an emphatically sporty flair in the interior, but also a multifunctional instrument display on the steering column as well as a new operating system with which vehicle functions, audio programme, communication, navigation and apps can be controlled particularly quickly and intuitively. The respective menu items are now displayed in modern form as live widgets on the 8.8-inch touch display in the central instrument and can be selected with a swiping motion similar to that on a smartphone. This makes it even easier to enter destinations when searching for island locations worth seeing, and the right music programme for the journey there is also available in no time at all. There is also a choice of two colour worlds for the graphics on both displays: relaxing blue and turquoise tones in \"Lounge\" mode or a combination of red and anthracite in \"Sport\" mode.The discovery tour in the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman begins in Palma de Mallorca. Like many Spanish coastal towns, the island capital has a Rambla. On the plane-lined promenade in the centre of the city, numerous florists offer their wares. It was once built in a dry riverbed, so the term rambla can also be translated as \"street leading to the sea\". The Passeig des Born, further south and not far from the cathedral, also has the character of a Rambla with its shady trees. From there it is only a few hundred metres to the marina of Palma.The Real Club Náutico de Palma has its headquarters there and organises one of the most important sailing competitions in Spain every year. Members of the Spanish royal family have taken part several times in the Copa del Rey regatta, which is held in the bay of Palma. However, Mallorca offers ideal conditions not only for sailing, but also for numerous other disciplines. The many opportunities for active leisure activities are what make the island so appealing to many visitors. For example, the varied route profile with winding coastal roads and sometimes quite steep mountain stages forms a training ground that is popular with amateur and professional cyclists alike. Extreme swimmers cross the 40-kilometre-wide strait between the east coast of Mallorca and the neighbouring island of Menorca in less than ten hours. And for some years now, adventurous people have been practising coasteering, climbing on steep coastal cliffs.Travellers to Mallorca who are enthusiastic about motor sports will also find what they are looking for on the island. Directly on the motorway, about halfway between Palma airport and Llucmajor, you will find the Circuit Mallorca, a car and motorbike race track with an attached kart track, which has been in operation for almost 25 years. Mallorca's motor sport associations use the track for competitions on two and four wheels. For this purpose, there is a control tower, a pit lane, a starting light, an electronic timing system and grandstands for up to 1,500 spectators. In addition, both local and foreign racing enthusiasts can optimise their driving skills on the Circuit Mallorca alone or under professional guidance. There are five left-hand and eight right-hand bends to negotiate on the asphalt track of the main circuit, which is around 3,200 metres long.For the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman, the excursion onto the racetrack is a more than welcome opportunity to demonstrate the qualities of its drive and chassis technology developed with sound racing know-how. Its 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology develops a maximum output of 225 kW\/306 hp and a maximum torque of 450 Nm. The furious temperament enables acceleration from zero to 100 km\/h in 4.9 seconds. The launch control function of the standard 8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission ensures perfect acceleration from a standstill. The MINI-specific ALL4 all-wheel drive system also contributes to traction-optimised power transmission.In the tight and fast-stepping bends of the Circuit Mallorca, the precisely controlled power distribution between the front and rear wheels also promotes the agility and driving dynamics of the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman. The ALL4 system is supported by the differential lock integrated into the automatic transmission. Its mechanical locking function shifts the drive torque from the unloaded inside front wheel to the outside front wheel during particularly sporty driving. This makes it possible to turn in and accelerate out of every bend with maximum dynamics and without loss of traction. The sports braking system developed in collaboration with the specialist manufacturer Brembo ensures maximum precision when braking in front of the bend. With its four-piston fixed-caliper disc brakes on the front axle, it offers constant deceleration performance and optimum pedal feel even after various high-speed laps on the Circuit Mallorca.The fact that the powertrain also remains largely unimpressed by the heat of the race track and the Spanish sun is thanks to the model-specific cooling system of the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman. Two outsourced coolant radiators, an expansion tank with a particularly large volume, an independent cooling module storage, an electric fan with increased power and a third cooling level realised by means of a condenser ensure an optimal operating temperature of the engine at all times, even under extreme load. In addition, the transmission has a separate cooling circuit with a separate oil cooler.So the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman remains a fascinatingly \"cool\" top athlete even after several laps on Mallorca's hottest track. And the driver can also be helped. From the Circuit Mallorca it is only five kilometres to the beach of El Arenal, where the tides of the Mediterranean Sea provide cooling. \n"}

Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you an overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. ->","completion":" DTM: Top-five finishes for the BMW M6 GT3 at Monza season-opener. The Royal Park in Monza (ITA) hosted last weekend’s opening round of the new GT3 DTM. Among those lining up in the realigned championship were the Walkenhorst Motorsport and ROWE Racing teams with their BMW M6 GT3. Saturday was a tough day, with only Marco Wittmann (GER) making it into the top ten in ninth place in the #11 Walkenhorst Motorsport car. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Timo Glock (GER), both driving for ROWE Racing, finished 12th and 17th. The tide turned for the BMW teams on Sunday, as the BMW M6 GT3 picked up two top-five finishes. Van der Linde had impressed in the #31 car in qualifying, securing third place on the grid. In the race itself, the South African made a spectacular overtaking manoeuvre to pass both Nico Müller (SUI \/ Audi) and Liam Lawson (NZL \/ Ferrari) in one go. After the round of pit stops, van der Linde found himself in fourth place, a position he maintained through to the finish. Wittmann made an impressive comeback from eleventh place on the grid and crossed the finish line just behind van der Linde in fifth place. Glock was forced to retire as a consequence of a collision in the jostling for position on lap one. Round two of the 2021 DTM season takes place from 23rd to 25th July at the Lausitzring (GER). --DTM Trophy: Magnificent season-opener for the BMW M4 GT4 at Monza. The DTM Trophy also kicked off the 2021 season at Monza (ITA) at the weekend – and victory in the first two races of the year went to BMW M Motorsport teams and the BMW M4 GT4. The season started with a bang in race one on Saturday, with eight BMW M4 GT4s in the first nine places. It was Ben Green (GBR) from the FK Performance Motorsport team who led from start to finish to convert pole position into victory. He was joined on the podium by his team-mate Moritz Löhner (GER) who comes from an Esports background and finished third in his first ever car race. Positions four to nine also went to BMW M Motorsport teams. In race two on Sunday, Michael Schrey (GER) from the Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport team claimed his maiden victory in the DTM Trophy. He led the race in his BMW M4 GT4 for a long time, before eventually crossing the finish line in second place. However, the driver ahead of him was subsequently handed a time penalty for gaining an advantage by leaving the track in a chicane. That saw Schrey promoted to first place. Victory on Sunday and fourth place on Saturday put Schrey second in the championship at the end of the opening weekend, followed by Green and Löhner in third and fourth. --ADAC GT Masters: Podium for Schubert Motorsport at the Red Bull Ring. The ADAC GT Masters held its second event of the season at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg (AUT) from 11th to 13th June. As at the opening round at Oschersleben (GER) in May, Schubert Motorsport featured on the podium. Nick Yelloly (GBR) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) were third in the #10 BMW M6 GT3 in Sunday’s race. The duo failed to finish race one on the Saturday. --ADAC GT4 Germany: Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport dominates in Spielberg. One week before his maiden DTM Trophy win, Michael Schrey (GER) and the Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport team dominated proceedings in ADAC GT4 Germany. Schrey and team-mate Gabriele Piana (ITA) were unbeatable again in the #2 BMW M4 GT4 at round two of the season, which took place from 11th to 13th June at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg (AUT). They had previously won both races at the season-opener in May at Oschersleben (GER) – and they repeated that double success in Austria. With four wins from four races, Schrey\/Piana and Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport hold big leads in both the Driver and Team competitions after two events. The Schubert Motorsport team finished in the top eight in both races at the Red Bull Ring. Michael von Zabiensky and Marcel Lenerz (both GER) were fifth and eighth in the #10 BMW M4 GT4. --GT4 European Series: Round three of the season at Zandvoort. The GT4 European Series was in the dunes of Zandvoort (NED) last weekend for its third event of the season. Cem Bölükbasi and Berkay Besler (both TUR) finished fifth and sixth in the Pro-Am class in the #12 BMW M4 GT4 of Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport. --GT4 Scandinavia: Lestrup Racing wins with the BMW M4 GT4 at the season-opener. GT4 Scandinavia kicked off the 2021 season at Fällfors, Sweden, last weekend. Victory in the first race of the year went to the BMW M4 GT4. Joakim Walde and Victor Bouveng (both SWE) won the Pro-Am class in the #98 Lestrup Racing BMW M4 GT4. The duo then finished third in race two. --BTCC: Turkington wins at Snetterton. It was a strong performance from Colin Turkington (GBR) at round two of the 2021 British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) in Snetterton (GBR). In the three races on 13th June, he claimed one victory and a podium in the #2 BMW 330i M Sport. Turkington won race one and, despite carrying the maximum success weight, finished runner-up in race two. He then came home third in race three. BMW tops the Manufacturer standings with 180 points and a lead of ten points after two rounds. --ESET Cup: Two podiums for the BMW M6 GT3 at Poznan. The Trevor Racing team and the #24 BMW M6 GT3 claimed two podium finishes in the ESET Cup at Poznan, Poland ended the Endurance Race in fourth place overall to take victory in the D4 GT4 class. \n"}

BMW i Andretti Motorsport produced good pace to start the second half of the season in the eighth race of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship, but was not rewarded with a podium finish. Jake Dennis (GBR) finished fifth in the #27 BMW iFE.21 to score ten points in the overall standings. Like Dennis, Maximilian Günther (GER) was in the top three for some time, even leading the race for a while. However, he struggled with energy problems in the final laps and crossed the finish line in twelfth position. For the first time this season, both BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers made it to Super Pole in qualifying. Dennis and Günther secured third and fifth places on the grid. After a great start, Günther moved into second position right ahead of Dennis and when leading driver Pascal Wehrlein (GER, Porsche) pulled into the Attack Zone, the two BMW iFE.21s were at the head of the field for a short time. Both drivers remained in with a good chance of a podium until a few laps before the end, only to lose ground. Dennis struggled after the field moved closer together during the second safety car period and had to activate Attack Mode one more time which cost him a few places. After 28 laps, he crossed the line in fifth position, while Günther struggled with energy problems and finished in twelfth place after outbraking himself on the final lap. Dennis and Günther are tenth and 17th in the drivers’ standings, and BMW i Andretti Motorsport is in sixth place in the team championship, with 65 points. Race nine of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E World Championship takes place on Sunday in Puebla. Reactions to Race 8 in Puebla. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal, team standings: 6th place):“The day started off pretty well. Out of the box I think both cars, in particular Jake, were very competitive. We had a really good result in qualifying having both BMW cars in Super Pole for the first time since Sanya in Season 5. When the lights went green an excellent start from Maximilian saw him in second place after turn one. Things were looking very promising. There were a couple of safety car incidents, one of which worked well for us and the second one unfortunately came at the wrong time for Jake and really compromised his second Attack Mode use. The field was packed up at that point and when he rejoined after taking the attack loop he sort of shuffled in the lower half of the top-ten. He was able to pick up a couple of spots and was able to finish in fifth place. We were looking like we are going to get our first double points score this season right up until the last lap but Maximilian at the time was somehow compromised with energy and he tried to defend. He locked up his front tyres and went straight on at a corner and then unfortunately when he came back onto the race track, it shuffled him back down into twelfth spot. There’s a lot of data to review overnight and we’ve got some ideas already on what we can do differently for tomorrow to hopefully see a stronger finish from both drivers in the second race here in Mexico.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 3rd place, race result: 5th place, points: 43, driver standings: 10th place):“We just got unfortunate with the safety car. We were one of only cars that hadn’t taken Attack Mode. Attack Mode here is so unforgiving; you lose three seconds, so we went from second to ninth. There were just a few things that went against us during the whole race but we brought it back in fifth. At one point I didn’t think we would even get points so I think as a team we can do better but as a team we did a mega job to bring this car back in the points.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 5th place, race result: 12th place, points: 22, driver standings: 17th place):“We struggled a bit in the free practice sessions but found a good direction for qualifying. I felt much more comfortable in the car. I had a great start from P5 straight to P2 and was able to manage the race pretty well. I lacked, however, a bit of pace over the entire race and as a result we slightly overconsumed energy. That led us into a difficult situation in the end. Over most of the race we were on course for the podium, but in the end we literally ran out of power and in turn 11, I had locking tyres on the inside while fighting for position. As a result, I unfortunately lost the points result on the final lap. It is disappointing, for sure, but we have to accept that and shift our focus to tomorrow.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race.

The ‘Official Test Days’ take place at the circuit in the Ardennes on 22nd and 23rd June. Just a few days later, the new BMW M4 GT3 will complete its first test under race conditions on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER). The tests ahead of the 24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps provide BMW M Motorsport with the ideal opportunity to test the BMW M4 GT3 at another demanding racetrack under real competitive conditions. The circuit is known as the ‘Ardennes Rollercoaster’ and is a fast, flowing track. Sharing the test work in Belgium will be Augusto Farfus (BRA), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR).“It is fantastic to have been given the opportunity to take part in the tests at Spa-Francorchamps with our new BMW M4 GT3,” said Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport. “Like the Nordschleife, this circuit has its own particular features, making it an optimal and very demanding test facility for us in the final stage of development of our car. The days at Spa will also be used to prepare for the race debut of the BMW M4 GT3, which we are all excited about. This test, under race conditions on the Nordschleife, is the next big step on the way to our first season in 2022.” The 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps has an important place in BMW’s motorsport history. With 24 triumphs to its name, the manufacturer is the record winner of the Belgian marathon. The BMW M4 GT3 will compete from 2022 and will be looking to continue this success. However, it must first watch and see how the BMW M6 GT3 gets on in its farewell performance at Spa at this year’s edition of the endurance classic, which takes place on 31st July and 1st August. The BMW M4 GT3 will make its race debut at round four of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS), on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife on 26th June, immediately after the tests in Belgium. At the wheel of the race car will be Jens Klingmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA). The BMW M4 GT3 will compete in the prototype class SP-X as the new car is not homologated yet. As this is a test in race mode, the BMW M4 GT3 will not be classified in the Nordschleife results. The outing will be used to gain valuable experience under race conditions with the new car. Note to editors: The BMW M4 GT3 will be displayed in the paddock during the fourth NLS race. Accredited media representatives are invited to check out the new race car. \n"}
{"prompt":"Newly designed Safety Training with specially converted vehicles starts in July 2021 and can be booked now. Theory lessons and practical driving exercises in the MINI John Cooper Works as well as in particularly sporty BMW models under the guidance of professional instructors. ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW and MINI Driving Experience is expanding its offering to include Safety Training for people with physical disabilities. From July 2021, for the first time, a driving-oriented programme will be conducted under the guidance of trained instructors and in specially converted BMW and MINI models. The choice of vehicles makes it clear that in addition to safe and confident reactions in different traffic situations, driving fun also plays a central role. In addition to the MINI John Cooper Works , particularly sporty BMW models are available for the Safety Training. The practical driving exercises in the programme range from braking and evasive manoeuvres to slalom driving on the ideal line and drifting through controlled oversteering in bends.\"Driving is self-determination and thus also a kind of freedom,\" says instructor Bettina Schmidt-Kiendl, who is herself dependent on a wheelchair and was instrumental in the conception of the new Safety Training. \"With the new programme, we want to give people with comparable disabilities the joy of driving that I also live every day.\" To achieve this goal, the training vehicles were converted so that they can be comfortably steered by hand. Both hands can remain on the steering wheel at all times. An additional ring on the steering wheel is used to accelerate. Directly next to it is a special brake lever. Thanks to these modifications, with a little practice it is possible to steer both the 170 kW\/231 hp MINI John Cooper Works and the BMW M3 Competition Sedan , which is powered by an inline six-cylinder engine with 375 kW\/510 hp, confidently and sportily around the training grounds.The Safety Training for people with disabilities is designed as a full-day event. Like all BMW and MINI Driving Experience safety training courses, it is divided into a theoretical and a practical section. To begin with, the instructors teach the participants important basics of driving physics and familiarise them with the converted vehicles. Among other things, they demonstrate the optimal seating position and the ideal steering wheel position for safe and sporty driving. This is followed by practical exercises with the MINI John Cooper Works, the new BMW M3 Competition Sedan and other current models.The ideal conditions for intensive driving safety training are provided by the BMW and MINI Driving Academy in Maisach near Munich. There, participants learn to control their vehicle calmly and skilfully even in surprising situations. Braking and evasive manoeuvres as well as lane changes with and without deceleration are practised on different road surfaces. In addition to a slalom course, the extensive area also includes a circuit and circular surfaces prepared for highly dynamic driving exercises with controlled oversteer. In addition to maximum safety and confidence at the wheel, the participants also gain increased driving pleasure during drift manoeuvres in sporty curves.The BMW and MINI Driving Experience offers a wide range of training courses for car and motorbike drivers designed to enhance individual driving skills. The selection ranges from safety courses for novice drivers to winter and racetrack training and courses for professional chauffeurs. With this offer, which has been in place since 1977, the BMW Group is making an important contribution to increasing road safety. Under the guidance of professional instructors, training courses are now offered in more than 30 countries around the world with current BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad models. All information about the new Safety Training for people with physical disabilities can be found under: http:\/\/bmw-drivingexperience.com\/en\/trainings\/bmw-driving-experience\/bmw-academy-experience\/safety-training-fpwd.html \n"}

While BMW Motorrad Motorsport celebrated third place at the ‘24 Heures Motos’ at Le Mans with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, Sunday did not play out as hoped for the WorldSBK side of the BMW family at Misano (ITA). The best-placed rider in race two was Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team in tenth place. His team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) was twelfth. Eugene Laverty (IRL \/ RC Squadra Corse), who was given the go-ahead by doctors this morning after his crash on Saturday, came home in 15th place to pick up a point. He was followed home in 16th place by Jonas Folger (GER \/ Bonovo MGM Racing). Misano hosted round three of the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Sykes started Sunday morning’s Superpole race from fifth place on the grid. He initially found himself in sixth after the start and crossed the finish line in seventh after ten laps of racing. The second-best BMW rider in the Superpole race was Laverty in 13th. Van der Mark consistently worked his way forward from 13th place, but then crashed out on the sixth lap. Folger, who was running behind him, was forced to take evasive action and consequently fell back through the field, eventually ending the Superpole race in 19th place. Van der Mark started race two on Sunday afternoon from 14th place. He made gradual progress from lap two and crossed the finish line tenth after 21 laps. Sykes was running sixth until the sixth lap, but then dropped back to ninth after a battle with his rivals. Shortly after that, he found himself in twelfth, and went on to cross the finish line in that position. Laverty also finished in the points in 15th. Folger was 14th for long stretches of the race, before dropping back to 16th. Quotes after race two at Misano. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We were definitely not where we expected to be. As such, it was disappointing. We did not manage to transfer the set-up from one circuit to the next with either Tom or Michael. The opposition can clearly do that better than us. All weekend we failed to give our riders a bike on which they are competitive. In the case of Tom, we reckoned on him taking eighth place. We must now find out why he fell so far back. Michael’s poor grid position once again left him with a mountain to climb. In the closing stages of the race, he was matching the pace of the seventh and eighth-placed riders. He eventually finished tenth, but on the whole it was disappointing because we definitely arrived here with greater expectations. We must work on being able to transfer a basic set-up from one circuit to the next. Before the next races at Donington Park we will do some testing at Navarra, where we will do our homework and work really hard. Congratulations at this point to the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team on their third place at Le Mans – respect to the guys. Their success saved the Sunday a bit for us here at Misano.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a really tough weekend for us. We came here with some high expectations but in the very high grip levels we found it difficult to get Tom and Michael comfortable on the bike. We had constant front-end chatter problems. The mechanics and the team worked all weekend trying to find a good balance; we’ve worked on the bike in a lot of areas but unfortunately we couldn’t find a setting for them both. Tenth and 12th doesn’t do the effort justice. We’re a long way off where we want to be but we have a test at Navarra coming up where we can check things over and we will see how we can come back stronger from this. We will be ready and are looking forward to the test at Navarra and then our home round at Donington.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I think we should not be really happy with this result. In this morning’s Superpole race I made a mistake by myself. I entered T1 way too quick and then I lost it. It was a shame because we tried something on the bike and we didn’t know if it was better or not. In race two, I had a not so great start. I had problems at the start and then I gained some positions back but unfortunately we can be really consistent but we are just too slow. It’s difficult, but it is like this now. Soon we will be testing and hopefully we find some solutions.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “To be honest, it was a difficult day. After the Superpole race we had quite a good feeling actually but we were missing in some areas and only really could finish in the top-seven, which for me is not acceptable. So we tried something with the bike for the big race, but unfortunately that was not working out. At least we got a lot of information out of it. It was a difficult race for me and we learned a lot on the back of it now, so we keep working now. After another test we are going for the next round to Donington. I would like to think we’ve got the package to fight for the race there. We need to get on top of the little issues which we have got, so we hope for another step forward with the BMW M 1000 RR. For now there will be a disappointing end of the weekend here at Misano, but we pick ourselves up and try to move on.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “The important thing is to get back on the horse and that is all today was. I am a racer and when I feel that I can ride the bike and score one point then I feel I owe it to my team and to BMW. So to score one point makes it worth it for me. Today, I was physically far from 100 per cent but I am happy that I raced because this is the important thing, to get back on and then recover next week and be ready to come back 100 per cent strong again.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Race two was our best result here at Misano, at least as far as our speed is concerned. We felt the heat and the tyre really heated up nicely. After this morning, we changed the transmission ratio a little which improved things. I was running really well in the first half of the race and managed to catch Tom Sykes. However, my front tyre then gave up on me and I had three slides, which I was able to save. The fourth time, braking into turn 4, I had a highsider that I only just managed to save that resulted in me going through the gravel and I lost positions. It was a shame that we missed out on the points as a result of that. However, our speed was better and we will take the positives with us, even though it was a tough weekend.” \n"}

Werner Daemen’s team had previously qualified third. When the endurance classic got underway at 12:00 (CEST) on Saturday, Reiterberger made a perfect start and immediately took the lead. However, shortly after that the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team suffered a major set-back. A problem with the fuel system led to several unscheduled pit stops. The team fell back to a seemingly forlorn 43rd place, many laps behind the leaders. The team showed fantastic fighting spirit and the three riders impressed with a thrilling performance on the M RR. Fast lap times allowed them to gradually work their way back towards the front of the field, one position at a time. By the halfway point at midnight, the #37 was already back in fifth place. Shortly after that, Mikhalchik climbed into fourth place. On Sunday morning, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team found itself third and on course for a podium finish. They remained in that position until Forés brought the #37 BMW M 1000 RR home in third place after 24 hours of racing. The two independent BMW Motorrad Motorsport teams, Team LRP Poland (#90 BMW S 1000 RR) and Team Univers Racing\/AC Racing (#23 BMW S 1000 RR) failed to finish. Round two of the FIM Endurance World Championship, the 12-hour race in Estoril (POR), will take place on 17th July. Quotes after the 24 Heures Motos at Le Mans. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Congratulations to the whole BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team on this fantastic effort.

After the strong start from Markus Reiterberger, we unfortunately had an issue with the fuel system, which saw us drop well back down the field. At that point, you could have been forgiven for thinking that the race was over in the first hour. However, Werner Daemen’s team and our riders Markus, Ilya and Xavi did not stick their heads in the sand and accepted the challenge. It was fantastic to see how they reeled in the field from the back and consistently worked their way to the front. They more than deserved to be stood on the podium at the end of the 24 hours. It is evidence of the team’s ability and fighting spirit. After the early set-back, that was a good start to the season.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I’m very proud about the result. The race by itself was not the best start because of Marcus’ small crash. We had some technical problems, and we lost about eight to nine laps. Then the riders, and the team made a good job because we were fighting back. Fortunately we got the third place – much more than we expected after the first laps. The team worked perfectly together for the whole week, and we go further like this for Estoril.” Markus Reiterberger: “I felt very honoured to ride at the start. Even walking to the bike was good, and when I pulled away it was really good. I really tried not to let the tyres cool and to save fuel but the tyres were still not right up to temperature, which really surprised me, as it was really hot. The front wheel ultimately folded in on me in the penultimate corner and I skidded into the gravel. I then did two more laps on the damaged bike, but then had to come into the pits. I feel sorry for the whole team that I made this mistake. In the end, the crash was not that bad. The main problem was the technical issues. Once those had been resolved, we were basically flawless for the rest of the 24 hours. I would like to thank the whole team for their hard work, and my team-mates for persevering so valiantly.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I don’t need to say a lot of words. The job is done, and our target has become real. Everyone is happy. Hard work pays off for everyone from the team, especially for me because I've been working really hard since last year. Obviously I’m really happy to stand on the podium with my team and I hope we will continue the same way in the next races.” Xavi Forés: “It was a really tough race for us. After the start, we had some issues and had to come to the garage a couple of times to solve it so we were at the bottom of the timings and then to make it to the podium felt like a victory for us. We knew that we are fast with our BMW M 1000 RR but could not automatically expect to be on the podium after the first hour. I am very grateful to be part of the team. The entire crew did an amazing job, we continued pushing and pushing until the end of the race. This third place was also very important for the championship and now we will give our all at Estoril. Thanks to all who made this possible.”\n"}

Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team ended the opening race in eighth and tenth place. ->","completion":" Misano. The FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) is at Misano on the Italian Adriatic coast, this weekend for round three of the 2021 season. Saturday proved to be a difficult day for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team ended the opening race in eighth and tenth place. Jonas Folger (GER \/ Bonovo MGM Racing) finished 16th, narrowly missing out on points. Eugene Laverty (IRL), riding for the Italian RC Squadra Corse team, was unable to take part in Superpole and race one following a crash in the morning’s free practice session. In Saturday morning’s Superpole, Sykes finished fifth on his BMW M 1000 RR to secure a spot on the second row of the grid. Van der Mark was 13th, while Folger came home 15th in Superpole. In the race itself, Sykes was running in the top six until the penultimate lap. However, he then dropped two places. Right from the word go, van der Mark set his sights on the top ten, crossing the finish line in tenth place after 21 laps of racing. Folger was 16th, missing out on the points by just one-tenth of a second. Fans are permitted in the grandstands at Misano for the first time this season. They were given a special welcome from the starting grid by Sykes, van der Mark, Folger and BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers – with signs which said “Welcome back Fans. Bentornati.” Following his crash, Laverty was examined in the medical centre at the circuit and was not given the go-ahead to take his place in race one. He will now be examined again before the warm-up on Sunday morning when it will be decided whether or not he may take part in the Sunday sessions. Quotes after race one at Misano. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “This Saturday was not our day. We definitely came here with greater expectations, but it emerged on Friday that we are not close to the podium places with both riders. Despite this, Tom still performed strongly. It was a shame that he was unable to hold on to sixth place in race one. In the case of Michael, it was clear yesterday and today that we were unable to really give him the right feeling. We will now analyse everything, but we cannot expect to make a really big jump forward by tomorrow. Despite this, we will try to get a top-six result. The only good news to come out of today is that Eugene is doing relatively well, despite his big crash this morning, and that he has not broken anything. That is the only positive news.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a very difficult day for us. I think the P6 position Tom was holding would have been a strong result for us but in the end he did not have enough tyre to hold off Bautista and Bassani, so it’s a shame he dropped to P8 as P6 would have been a good result for Tom. So, we will come back tomorrow, and we will fight again. Michael on the other hand really struggled; he didn’t look comfortable on the bike and hasn't found the setting that he can attack with. And if he can’t attack going through the fast flowing corners he loses so much time and ends up battling with the company he was with, so he needs to work hard with his crew overnight and see what we improve on. I think overall a little bit disappointing but we will come back stronger tomorrow and hopefully we can improve on these results.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We got a bad start to the race today and it definitely didn’t help our track position. We are very strong in some areas of the track but with our package we still lose in the area where I normally could gain the most on people. I saw that Alvaro Bautista was coming strong in race one and I changed my way of riding while still maintaining a respectable lap time and just kept the door closed as long as I could but eventually he managed to get through and pushed me a little wide. I tried to cut back on him which was not achievable and as a result lost a further spot to Bassani. We didn’t get what we hoped for today, but overall I feel we are improving our race performance and obviously we will go back to the drawing board tonight with a slightly different set up for tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I’m not really happy with the result. In this morning’s FP3, we made a good step forward but unfortunately I did not feel as good in qualifying. So it was P13 on the grid. I had an okay start, but I especially struggled with the front. To be honest I was just riding around with a too slow pace. Now we have to sort out some problems; so we have a lot of work to do for tomorrow.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Unfortunately, we did not find what we were hoping for this weekend in order to have a better feel. Our pace was not bad, but I simply don’t have the trust in the bike to go for it in the opening laps. When I overtook Tito Rabat in the third-from-last corner, I unfortunately went wide. I just went for it, but unfortunately did not quite pull it off. Our times did improve, but it is still not what we were hoping for. Our goal was to finish in the top ten. Unfortunately, we were a long way off achieving that. It is a difficult time for us right now, but we are always trying to make the best of the situation.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “Thank you everyone for the kind messages and support on social media and of course a big thank you to all the volunteers, especially the marshals who reacted so quick and the paramedics who took care about me after my crash this morning. Fortunately everything is okay. I have had some scans on my back and my neck, I am pretty stiff and it’s not sure for tomorrow, but I have a medical check tomorrow morning, so let’s wait and see if all is clear, so I can race again tomorrow.” \n"}

It will be a very long and tough race in these temperatures – but we are confident.” Markus Reiterberger: “It was very hot in the first qualifying session yesterday, and that is apparently something we struggle with. The bike behaves differently in these temperatures to during the test in spring. It was cooler today and I was the fastest man in the team with a 1:35 lap on the new tyre – not the Qualifier. We all improved and managed to secure third place on the grid. We saw that we have a slight disadvantage in the heat, but that changes when it gets cooler. Because of this, we must now consider how to pace the race tactically. It is definitely going to be a challenging, long and tough race, but we are feeling positive and excellently prepared.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am happy about the result. Especially today I had a good feeling. The days before I still was struggling a bit as the temperatures were hotter than during the test in spring and that was a challenge for us. But the team found good solutions for the bike, even for hot conditions, and the tyres started to work quite well. We are confident that we can do a good job. The important thing is to have a good start and to be constant and stable and then, when the night comes, it should be our time, because we were really fast in the cooler temperatures. Let’s hope for a clean race and that we can finish in a top position after 24 hours.” Xavi Forés: “Qualifying went quite well for us. We finished in third position and our pace was quite good. But the track conditions were much hotter than when we were here for testing, so our bike is working differently. Overall, it was not too bad. All three riders have been riding on the same pace, which has to be the target especially for the race. So yes, I am happy. The bike is working as we want and we have to be clever for the race.

BMW M Motorsport is returning to international prototype racing. On Thursday, it was confirmed that an LMDh car is being developed for use in the North American IMSA series. From the 2023 season, this car will allow BMW M Motorsport to compete for overall race wins at such prestigious classics as Daytona, Sebring and Road Atlanta (all USA). “BMW is back on the big motorsport stage,” said Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “In entering the LMDh class, BMW M Motorsport is fulfilling the prerequisites to challenge for overall victory at the most iconic endurance races in the world from 2023. We will be fully focussed on tackling this challenge. There is a spirit of optimism here. BMW has a successful history in prototype racing – the Le Mans victory in 1999 was unforgettable. Reviving this story in a modern prototype with M Power will thrill fans of BMW M Motorsport. The LMDh concept guarantees maximum cost control and offers a wide range of possible applications, including the IMSA series in North America, an extremely important market for BMW M. We are all eager to get stuck into the LMDh category with a compact and highly-efficient team set-up.” Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport, is responsible for the development, testing and race outings of the new car. He added: “Everyone in our motorsport team shares the same motivation: we want to test ourselves against our strongest opposition at the racetrack – and to celebrate victories for BMW. As such, the LMDh project is a real affair of the heart for us and exactly the new challenge we were hoping for. An extremely exciting project awaits us. To challenge for overall victories in Daytona and Sebring is a massive motivation. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but the anticipation is immense.” The regulations for LMDh cars stipulate that they have both a combustion engine and an electric motor. While each manufacturer may develop their own combustion engine, the electric motor and battery, as well as the transmission, are standard parts. The chassis is also built by an external partner. A BMW M Motorsport works involvement, with two cars, is planned from the 2023 IMSA season. The works team and the driver line-up for the two LMDh prototypes will be announced at a later date. The last big win for a BMW prototype came in 1999, when the BMW V12 LMR won the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). The car also won the 12 Hours of Sebring in the USA in the same season.\n"}

After the 2020 class win in the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW Junior Team made a strong debut in the BMW M6 GT3 at the 2021 edition of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER). Alongside Augusto Farfus (BRA), Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) showed strong speed and fighting spirit in the race, but were not rewarded with a good result. Despite the disappointment over the wrong tyre selection at the start and the retirement due to a technical defect shortly before the end of the race, the general conclusion of everyone involved is positive. “We went into this race with very ambitious goals and definitely wanted to get a top-ten result with the BMW Junior Team. For a while it looked like we might even improve on that goal. A top-five result was within reach but unfortunately the course of the race ended up writing a different story,” summed up mentor Jochen Neerpasch. “I still think that the BMW Junior Team passed the master’s exam with their performance.” It was a weekend of firsts. Hesse experienced the first of these in top qualifying when, after Farfus’ perfect groundwork in putting the #77 BMW M6 GT3 in the pole position shootout, he completed his first GT3 laps in the rain on the Nordschleife. He mastered this challenge flawlessly and secured tenth on the grid ahead of many Nürburgring experts with significantly more experience. “We started the weekend well and got ourselves a good starting position,” said Hesse. Strong recovery performance after unlucky start.In light of the extremely difficult track conditions, at the start of the race BMW Team RMG and starting driver Farfus opted for the wrong tyres for their 24-hours debut with the BMW M6 GT3. Farfus pitted right after the formation lap and was given wet tyres – a 50\/50 decision since some sections of the track were wet and some were dry. Unfortunately heavier rain didn’t start until so much later that Farfus was unable to keep using his wet tyres and make up the time he lost due to the pit stop. “It was really difficult to gauge the weather conditions at the start, and unfortunately we opted for the wrong tyres,” said team principal Stefan Reinhold. After that, things went very well until the race was red-flagged on Saturday evening due to fog, and again after the restart on Sunday. Flawless stints saw Farfus, Hesse and Harper move up the field. “Up until the red flag and again after the restart our strategy was aimed at making up as much ground as possible which we managed,” explained Reinhold. Verhagen experienced his first at the restart; he had never done a flying start in the GT3 car before. He did a great job, and showed strong speed and courageous overtaking manoeuvres in his ensuing stint. Up until 30 minutes before the end of the race, the BMW Junior Team had fought its way back into the top ten, and if they hadn’t been awarded a time penalty for Verhagen coming into contact with another car, they would have even made it into the top five. But then a technical defect and a subsequent collision forced the #77 BMW M6 GT3 out the race. “Augusto suddenly no longer had any propulsion in a fast sector, which meant that he was in the way of the cars behind him,” said Reinhold, summarising: “Obviously, we envisaged our first appearance at the Nürburgring a little differently. We learned a lot of lessons in this race, which hopefully we will be able to build on soon.” Juniors draw positive conclusions.With all the disappointment immediately after the retirement, the Juniors also ended up drawing positive conclusions. “This race was a roller coaster ride for us. Obviously, the final result is disappointing, but our race pace was very strong,” said Harper. Hesse added: “Even though we didn’t achieve anything measurable in the end, we can be pleased with our 24-hour debut in the GT3 car. After our wrong tyre selection at the start, BMW Team RMG did a magnificent job in terms of pit stops and strategy, and got us to the front of the field again. Having Augusto in the team was fantastic for us Juniors.” On behalf of the whole BMW Junior Team, Verhagen said: “Many thanks to everyone who made this race possible. Above all, thanks to BMW Team RMG, who took on this huge challenge with us and did an outstanding job during the preparation already. An equally big thank you goes to Augusto, who was incredibly helpful at making us really fast on the Nordschleife. This event was an amazing experience. We learned a great deal and will hopefully come back even stronger.” Farfus: “I really enjoyed the collaboration.”Farfus, who has worked closely with the BMW Junior Team throughout the season, sees the project as very positive: “It’s a real shame that we were unable to bring home the race result that we deserved, but all in all the teamwork with the BMW Junior Team and BMW Team RMG was fantastic. BMW M Motorsport has made a fantastic selection with Dan, Max and Neil. They are all incredibly fast. When it comes to speed they don’t really need my help, but I think I was able to help them a lot in other areas, such as processes during the race, preparation, set-up of the car and handling the traffic on the Nordschleife. I really enjoyed the collaboration.” For Harper, Hesse and Verhagen, the Nordschleife season continues on 26th June with the fourth race of the Nürburgring Endurance Series season.\n"}

After the double-header in Spain and Portugal, BMW Motorrad Motorsport is now heading to the third round of the FIM Superbike World Championship 2021 (WorldSBK) at Misano, Italy. The circuit on the Adriatic coast has proved to be a happy hunting ground in the past. In 2019, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Tom Sykes (GBR) celebrated the first podium finish there for a WorldSBK project that was still in its infancy. The Misano race did not take place last year due to the Coronavirus pandemic. BMW Motorrad Motorsport is now hoping to build on that successful 2019 appearance at Misano with the new BMW M 1000 RR, which is in its first season as the WorldSBK race bike. Sykes will be joined by Michael van der Mark (NED) in the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Misano is the home race for the BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse. Eugene Laverty (IRL) is competing for the Italian team. Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing is also very familiar with the circuit. Quotes ahead of the Misano round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We are heading to Misano with plenty of optimism. The first two races of the season at MotorLand Aragón and Estoril took place on circuits that we already knew would be challenging for us. Nonetheless, we were able to record some satisfying results, and even more importantly, we were able to test our new BMW M 1000 RR extensively under racing conditions. We know where our strengths lie and where we still have some work to do. In Misano, the situation is completely different to how it was at the first two circuits on the calendar. We have some good memories of Misano and were able to show that how much we like this circuit at the last race there in 2019. Of course, we will never forget the first podium finish with Tom. Now we are confident that we can put on a strong performance at Misano with the new M RR.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First of all, we are delighted to return to Misano after missing out last year. For sure, 2019 was a very good event for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and now to return with the BMW M 1000 RR will be good to compare our improvements. Hopefully we can repeat that success from 2019. We are going into the weekend both Michael and Tom coming back from Estoril with some new direction. For sure, Michael is starting to feel very acclimatised with his electronic feel of his M RR and that’s really important. He is really starting to feel like the bike can do exactly what he wants and that's a good step for him so his confidence is very strong in that area. On the other side, Tom still has some concerns over his chassis direction and we will work on that in Friday’s practices. But hopefully quickly Tom can get into a good rhythm and can prepare himself ready for Superpole and the races. We hope we can get some good conditions in the weather and we have some straight forward races with no weather causing any issues because the forecast predicts some thunderstorms around that time. Overall as a team, we are happy to return, we feel quite confident that the Misano circuit should be favourable for us and we are ready to get on track.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Misano is one of my favourite tracks. I really missed going there last year. I love the circuit, I love the layout and I am looking forward to it. It’s a completely different track again compared to Aragón and Estoril but I think it will suit the BMW very well and especially the way the bike is working now. After some good results at Aragón and Estoril a very different track and I think we can do really well there. Regarding goals for the weekend, I think it is still difficult to say where we expect to be but I think we should be close to the top five. We had some good results, the gap is still a little bit too big but I think the way the Misano track is we can do really well.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am obviously looking very much forward to the Misano round of the WorldSBK calendar. It’s a circuit I really enjoy. It will certainly be tight in terms of lap times as it is quite small and twisty so we’re really looking to be competitive. We’ve had some strong results there in the past with the BMW S 1000 RR so hopefully with the updated M RR we can improve on those. That’s certainly my target and it would be fantastic. We’ve had a podium success there so if we could do something similar this weekend it’s what we need. Overall, it’s a fantastic location and I am looking forward to getting out there.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “I’m heading to Misano feeling very optimistic. I set modest goals for myself last time out due to the fact that Estoril was the toughest track on the calendar for us last year. However, I far exceeded my expectations so my confidence is high going to a track that I really enjoy. The new BMW M 1000 RR has made a huge step forward this year and I’m very thankful for the hard work done by everybody at BMW Motorrad Motorsport during the winter months. I have gelled very well with my new team RC Squadra Corse and we’re ready to begin moving up the order. The first two rounds were like pre-season testing for us. I feel that our season begins properly at round three at Misano.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I am looking forward to Misano. It will be interesting to see how the BMW M 1000 RR feels on this circuit. I am hoping for a consistent weekend, and that we can finish in good positions. I think we will be satisfied with that. I also hope that we can settle on the right basic set-up for the bike at Misano which we can then use in the other races.” Track Facts Misano.Circuit length4.226 km – clockwiseCorners16 – 10 right-handers, 6 left-handersPole positionRightLongest straight510 metres (start-finish straight)Grip levelMediumTrack layoutSeveral long straights, partly fast corners, hard braking zonesStrain on brakesMediumAmount at full throttle30 %Topspeed \/ lowest speed276 km\/h \/ 55 km\/hBest overtaking opportunityT1, T8Key factorsGood feeling on the brakes, stability, traction \n"}

Jesse Krohn (FIN) finished fourth in the Schubert Motorsport #20 BMW M6 GT3, while Max Hesse (GER) was tenth in the #77 BMW M6 GT3 of the BMW Junior Team. Just before the start of Top Qualifying, the lap of honour for the BMW M3 ‘Eifelblitz’ in memory of Sabine Schmitz ensured a sensational atmosphere. While the track was still dry, Augusto Farfus (BRA) had put the BMW Junior Team in a position to battle for the top ten by recording the third-fastest time in the first part of Top Qualifying, thereby qualifying for the top 20 shootout. Hesse then held his nerve as stormy weather led to extremely challenging track conditions. The session went even better for Yelloly, who coped best with the conditions to lap more than two seconds faster than the second-placed car. A strong performance in the individual time trial put Krohn in third place for some time, but he was still pleased to finish fourth and secure a spot on the second row of the grid. The Walkenhorst Motorsport #100 car competing in the Pro-Am class had also made it into Top Qualifying 2, but chose not to appear for safety reasons and was classified in 20th position. The Walkenhorst Motorsport #101 BMW M6 GT3, the #98 BMW M6 GT3 from ROWE Racing and the Walkenhorst Motorsport #102 BMW M6 GT3 will start the race from 24th, 25th and 30th positions. Appearance of ‘Eifelblitz’ in memory of Sabine Schmitz evokes real emotion.The 30 minutes leading up to the first of the two Top Qualifying sessions were dominated by memories of the recently deceased Nürburgring legend Sabine Schmitz. Johannes Scheid, who won the 24-hour race together with Schmitz in 1996 and 1997 at the wheel of the BMW M3 ‘Eifelblitz’, completed a lap of honour around the Nordschleife in a replica of the winning car from 1996. It started in the pit lane, accompanied by applause from the other teams and drivers, who emerged from their pit areas to form a guard of honour for the ‘Eifelblitz’. “It was very emotional to first see everyone in the pit lane and then the track marshals along the circuit, who had even made their own banners,” said Scheid after his lap. “I said to Sabine: ‘They are all there for you’. It was very moving. It still gives me a chill just to think about it. We owed it to her and I think it is fantastic that BMW made it possible.” Reactions to Top Qualifying: Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The conditions for qualifying today were extremely difficult and we are very pleased with the BMW performance. Last year’s winners ROWE Racing and Nick Yelloly in pole position after an outstanding display of driving, Jesse Krohn in fourth place in the BMW M6 GT3 from Schubert Motorsport and Max Hesse in the BMW Junior Team car, which Augusto Farfus got out of Q1 and into Q2, in tenth position – that was a superb performance. But that is just the beginning. We have a very long race ahead of us, and it will all be about making a few errors as possible. Today, the Nordschleife has already shown that you can always expect unpredictable weather conditions and it will be no different tomorrow. And you have to consider the strength of the competition. We have a mature and reliable car in the form of the BMW M6 GT3, we have very good teams and we have very good drivers. Together, we will attempt to get the very best out of this. We are looking forward to this race.“ Nick Yelloly (#1 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 1st place): “I am very, very happy to bring that pole home for BMW. Obviously after last year’s event, when we managed to win, to start off like this is just superb. I couldn’t picture a better start to the weekend. It was pretty tricky and slippery out there but it worked out. Now it’s all about focusing for the race. We know that it is going to be mixed conditions so we have to be very good and on top of our game in terms of calling the right pit strategy and tyre choice. But the team were amazing, as were BMW, last year in doing so, so there is no reason why we can’t do it again.” Jesse Krohn (#20 BMW M6 GT3, Schubert Motorsport, 4th place): “I am very happy. Obviously starting in the top ten is quite important in this race and we managed to qualify in the top five so I can be happy especially as I can’t even remember the last time I drove here on the wet and many of the other guys drove a lot here last year so in that sense they had a bit of an advantage. But I just went to the risk level that I was comfortable with, that I knew I can do a good job with and not risk the car. Because tomorrow is the big day, today was just one step to the goal.” Max Hesse (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team, 10th place): “Mega! That was the first time I had ever driven any laps in the GT3 car in the rain. From the start, I realised that it would not be an easy task. But overall, we are of course super happy with tenth place. It's our first top ten result at our first 24-hour race in the GT3. A big thank you to Augusto as well; his Q1 lap was really great. The lads did a super job and the car went perfectly. All four of us feel really good in the car and now it is all about focusing on the race, we still have 24 hours of driving ahead of us.” Augusto Farfus (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team, 10th place): “It is awesome! Considering that Max has never tried a GT3 in the wet, he did a superb job. I am very proud of what we have done. Top Qualifying 1 was not an easy one because there was no room for mistakes so we did do a good job and went through to Q2. Then Max did a great job. We have three BMWs in the top ten – it could not be any better.”\n"}

BMW Motorrad Motorsport and BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team get the FIM Endurance World Championship 2021 (FIM EWC) started with a real endurance classic. The season kicks off with the ‘24 Heures Motos’ on 12th\/13th June at Le Mans (FRA). For Werner Daemen’s team it is their second year in the endurance world championship after a strong maiden season. The new #37 bike in action is the BMW M 1000 RR. The regular riders Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Xavi Forés (ESP), as well as Kenny Foray (FRA) as the fourth rider make for an experienced, strong rider line-up. BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team prepared the new M RR for its race appearances in the FIM EWC with intensive test rides. At the official Pré-Mans Test at the end of March, the team set the best time with new record laps with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR on both days and is now eager to build on that performance at the first race weekend of the season. The FIM EWC 2021 consists of four events in France, Portugal and Japan. After the opener at Le Mans, the season continues on 17th July with the 12 Hours of Estoril in Portugal. The 24-hour classic ‘Bol d’Or’ will be held at Le Castellet (FRA) on 18th\/19th September, before the season draws to a close with the 8-hour race at Suzuka, Japan on 7th November. Quotes ahead of the Le Mans season opener. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “After the long winter break, the FIM EWC is finally returning to action. BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team’s maiden season was a strong one, and with our new BMW M 1000 RR we are now taking the next step in the endurance world championship as well. The bike has undergone further optimisations in many areas. In collaboration with our partner Dunlop, we also spent the break developing some very good new tyre options. Another very important point is our strong and very well-oiled rider line-up. We confirmed the potential of our bike as well as the team and riders in impressive fashion at the Le Mans pre-test. Now we need to make use of this in the race as well. It goes without saying that endurance racing, and 24-hour races in particular, have their own peculiarities. But we and the team have done everything to make sure we are as well-prepared as possible.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I think that we are better prepared for Le Mans than last year, so I’m expecting a good result. We are very happy with the new BMW M 1000 RR and the pre-test at Le Mans was superb for us. All our riders are in top form. We are ideally positioned with Ilya, Markus and Xavi as our regular trio, and I can honestly say that with Kenny we have the fastest reserve rider in the world. He proved that once again last weekend, when he finished second in the French championship. Now the team is working on fine-tuning every detail. I’m looking forward to the race, and if everything goes according to plan, we should be up there at the front.” Markus Reiterberger: “I’m delighted that we can finally race again. We made full preparations at the tests. The whole team did a fantastic job. We saw that our bike works really well and always knew the direction in which we needed to make changes. Our rider line-up is incredibly strong and during the tests we saw that we are working at a very high level. We were the clear number one at Le Mans which makes us optimistic. Now, I’m hoping that we can make good use of the experience we gained from the tests in the race. We are well-prepared and are aiming to get through the 24 hours safely and without any errors. Now, it is important to focus on our race pace once again in the practice sessions and to have good qualifying sessions. I’m confident and am really looking forward to a fantastic race weekend at Le Mans.” Xavi Forés: “I am really looking forward to starting the FIM EWC season at Le Mans. We tested there a couple of times, and overall it was quite good. All three of us were doing the same fast lap times under the lap record. This is really important for us and means that we have a strong and consistent package. If the weather stays like we want it to, we can definitely fight for the victory. That has to be the goal and there would be no better way to start the season and to represent the new BMW M 1000 RR. So we are ready to start the season.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “After the strong tests at Le Mans it looks like we are ready for the race. The speed was really incredible and all of us riders were fast. I will try to continue this pace and feeling on the race weekend and finish it at the same level. I am looking forward to the weekend, to great teamwork in BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team and to bringing BMW to the top.” Kenny Foray: “I am looking forward to Le Mans. I think everyone is ready to achieve a good result. The new bike, the BMW M 1000 RR, is really fast and consistent.

The BMW M4 GT3 will contest its first race on 26th June at round four of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS). The purchase price for the car, which has undergone significant improvements in the areas of driveability, cost efficiency and operation, will be € 415,000 net. You can find our Media Guide with detailed data and facts on the development of the BMW M4 GT3 attached to this press release and in the BMW Group Pressclub. “The development work on the BMW M4 GT3 is now on the finishing straight, and the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring is the perfect stage on which to present the car in its BMW M Motorsport design and thus to herald the final phase leading up to the first race outings,” said Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “The new BMW M4 Competition provides the perfect basis for the BMW M4 GT3, whose engine was designed from the outset for use at the racetrack. This underlines how road car and race car development always go hand in hand at BMW M GmbH. The new car offers state-of-the-art technology, thanks to our technology partners. They are among the best in their respective fields, and we are delighted to have them supporting us on the development of the BMW M4 GT3 with their specific know-how and areas of expertise. That is the perfect basis for a successful new race car.” Since the start of 2020, the BMW M4 GT3 has undergone many stages of development. This began virtually with CAD and CFD simulations, and continued with the use of an engine on the test bench, the assembly of the test chassis and work in the wind tunnel. One milestone was the roll-out on 18th July 2020. This was followed by many tests at various racetracks, at which many BMW works drivers made valuable contributions. In December 2020, at the BMW SIM Live Event, Philipp Eng (AUT) demonstrated the steering wheel for the BMW M4 GT3, which was developed together with FANATEC. It is the first steering wheel in the world that can be used in both a real race car and a simulator without modifications. In 2021, the test work continued in Monteblanco (ESP), Almeria (ESP) and on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER). The car currently has more than 14,000 test kilometres under its belt – that is the equivalent of more than 70 hours of track time. Throughout this phase, the BMW M Motorsport engineers worked hard to improve the driveability and reliability of the car on its way to being race-ready. The goal: to significantly reduce lifecycle costs and maintenance expenditure compared to its predecessor. Following the launch and race debut in June, the BMW M4 GT3 will undergo more tests and race outings before it is delivered to the first customers, who will compete with the car all over the world in 2022. The biggest improvements compared to its predecessor, the BMW M6 GT3, are in three areas: driveability, cost efficiency and operation. The BMW M4 GT3’s handling and cockpit equipment are more comfortable for amateur drivers, while the car is easier on the tyres and offers greater consistency. Far lower lifecycle costs and longer maintenance intervals for the engine and transmission are vital economic factors. Operating the car has been made far easier by the fact that many basic settings can be configured directly via the steering wheel, without having to connect an external laptop. The purchase price of the BMW M4 GT3 starts at € 415,000 net – € 4,000 less than the price of its predecessor, the BMW M6 GT3, and roughly the same as its competitors. The ‘Competition Package’ is available as an option ex factory for an additional charge. This includes useful optional features, integrated and tested specifically for use in endurance races. As a special extra, the package includes an exclusive training day in an in-house BMW M4 GT3 simulator. Comparison of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M6 GT3: Dimensions:Technical data:\n"}
{"prompt":"It was the venue for spectacular Formula 1 races early on, and since 1970 the legendary Eifel circuit has been the venue for one of the world's most popular endurance races. But also beyond the race weekends, the region around the \"Green Hell\" is a popular destination for motorsport fans and driving enthusiasts. ->","completion":" Munich. It is a marathon for people and engines. Once a year, the top stars of touring car and Gran Turismo racing battle it out for victory at the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring. The atmosphere at the competition against and around the clock is reminiscent of the times when Formula 1 races were still held on the Nürburgring's Nordschleife. As a real spectator magnet - and at least from next year onwards it will be again - the 24-hour race has already attracted up to 200,000 spectators to the grandstands as well as to the meadows and camping areas along the track in the Eifel. Motorsport fans and driving enthusiasts, however, are captivated by the \"Ring\" all year round. For them, the racing flair around the legendary Nordschleife and the adjacent Grand Prix circuit opened in 1984 is simply irresistible, as a 24-hour trip around the Nürburgring in the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible impressively proves.Hatzenbach, Fuchsröhre, Adenauer Forst, Caracciola-Karussell, Hohe Acht, Döttinger Höhe: the names of the famous sections of the Nürburgring have a mystical ring. During the so-called tourist drives, hobby drivers can follow the tracks of the professionals and their racing cars in their private vehicles. But to feel the fascination of the Nürburgring, it is enough to be on the country roads in the surrounding area. Over more than 20 kilometres, the Nordschleife winds its way through the hilly and wooded landscape of the High Eifel. As a result, the tradition-steeped race track passes several villages, crosses public roads with bridges and subways, and can be seen from outside by looking over the fence in many places.Three-time Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart once gave the Nürburgring-Nordschleife the name \"Green Hell\". To this day, it is considered the most demanding race track in the world. The BMW Group's test and development engineers use the varied course to put the finishing touches to the driving characteristics of new models. A vehicle that passes the endurance test on the Nordschleife can convince on any road in the world.A piece of the Nordschleife is also in the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible. The developers call integrated application the fine-tuning on test tracks, country roads and, not least, on the race track that ensures that all drive and chassis systems work together perfectly. In the case of the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible, the test programme has resulted in the thrilling performance characteristics of its 2.0-litre, 170 kW\/231 hp four-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology being transformed into extreme driving pleasure. This is achieved with both the standard 6-speed manual transmission and the optional 8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission and with the model-specific sports suspension as well as with the latest generation of the Adaptive Suspension, which now features frequency-selective shock absorbers to ensure sporty handling and long-distance ride comfort.The model-specific steering, the sports brake system with four-piston fixed caliper brakes on the front wheels developed in cooperation with the specialist manufacturer Brembo and the 17-inch John Cooper Works light-alloy wheels are also fixed components of the standard overall package for fascinating performance. Added to this are the design features characteristic of John Cooper Works models, which ensure optimum aerodynamic balance even in highly dynamic driving situations. In the latest new edition of the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible, the detailed work done to optimise airflow is visible at first glance. Vertical air intakes in the front apron, which now has a particularly clear and purist design, direct the airflow specifically along the wheels to reduce turbulence. At the rear of the underbody, the airflow now meets a particularly distinctive diffuser in the rear apron.On the country roads of the Eifel, the result of the precise fine-tuning can be felt over every kilometre. They, too, offer the mixture of tight bends and long curves, ascents and descents that make up the charm of the Nordschleife. In addition to untouched nature, historical monuments also invite you to stop off. These include, of course, Nürburg Castle, built in the 12th century, which helped give the \"Ring\" its name and which today sits on a hill in the middle of the Nordschleife. The most beautiful view of the ruins of the castle is in the village of the same name not far from the access road to the race track.The \"Ring\" itself is also omnipresent on a day trip through the Eifel. Time and again, a section of the Nordschleife suddenly catches your eye as you drive between villages, meadows and forests. If you stop at the right place, you will immediately be within sight of the ideal line and can, for example, use the lunch break to watch tourist or professional test drives on the race track.The tourist infrastructure of the High Eifel also includes numerous signposted cycling and hiking trails. In the very north-east of the \"Ring Region\", not far from the Caracciola Carousel, the former steep section of the Nordschleife can be explored on foot or on two wheels. There, for example, all it takes is a short change from the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible to the MINI Folding Bike from the MINI Lifestyle Collection to realise that the section of track that was closed down decades ago does not bear its name without good reason.Around the \"Ring\", there is a choice of different types of accommodation at campsites and in holiday home settlements. They were created primarily for visitors to the motor sport events, the annual rock festival and numerous other events on the Nürburgring grounds. But they are also the ideal destination for a relaxed end to a day full of driving fun during a 24-hour excursion to the Nürburgring. \n"}

Also to be found on the standard equipment list for the BMW iX is the Parking Assistant including Reversing Assist Camera and the Reversing Assistant.Exterior design exuding progressive luxury; spacious interior with a feel-good ambience.The pioneering character of the BMW iX also clearly shines through in its exterior design. The clearly structured, reduced design language, the body’s imposing styling with muscular SAV proportions and the precisely crafted details create an aura of progressive luxury. Standout exterior features include the almost completely blanked-off BMW kidney grille, whose surface is the product of innovative manufacturing techniques and incorporates camera and radar sensors.The BMW iX has been rigorously designed from the inside out. Its interior has been created to provide quality of life and personal well-being. Vast amounts of room and newly developed seats with integral head restraints set the tone for the luxurious ambience. The absence of a centre tunnel creates extra legroom and sufficient space for storage facilities and a centre console designed in the style of a high-quality piece of furniture. The control panel with feeler bars and active haptic input as well as a rocker switch for gear selection adds some very modern flourishes. Besides the BMW Curved Display, the hexagonal steering wheel and frameless projector integration for the optional Head‑Up Display further add to the focused driving experience. There is a choice of three different trims for customising the interior.The automatic climate control system in the BMW iX comes with a nanofibre filter to purify the air and new touchscreen controls. The system intelligently combines interior ventilation and surface, seat and steering wheel heating to maximise the occupants’ sense of well-being. The optional Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System with speakers integrated out of sight in the head restraints and a 4D Audio function using bass shakers in the front seats promises the ultimate sound experience.In addition to acoustic pedestrian protection, the BMW iX also features a specially composed drive sound, which adds to the thrill of the driving experience by providing authentic feedback in response to accelerator movements and speed. The BMW IconicSounds Electric function included as standard also allows new sound variants from a collaboration with film score composer Hans Zimmer to be added to the acoustic repertoire.Production at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing using purely green power, monitored raw materials extraction, high proportion of natural and recycled materials.The BMW iX will be produced at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. Both the vehicle itself and the battery cells will be manufactured using green power across the board. The BMW Group procures the cobalt and lithium required for the high-voltage batteries from controlled sources in Australia and Morocco and delivers it to the battery cell manufacturers. The design principle for the electric motors allows the use of rare earth metals to be avoided in the drive system rotors. Added to which, the company sources aluminium produced using power from solar energy plants.A high proportion of secondary aluminium and reused plastic also contribute to the resource-efficient production of the BMW iX. Its interior uses FSC-certified wood, leather tanned with olive leaf extracts and other natural materials. Recycled fishing nets are among the raw materials used for the floor coverings and mats.\n"}

BMW Motorrad Motorsport rounded off the second race weekend in the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Estoril (POR) with a solid Sunday: three BMW M 1000 RRs were among the top nine to cross the line in the second main race. Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team rode his way up from 14th on the grid to finish sixth on his BMW M 1000 RR. His team-mate, Tom Sykes (GBR), finished eighth. Eugene Laverty (IRL), competing for the BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse, wrapped up a strong Sunday in ninth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing retired early from the second race due to a technical problem. Sykes was the best BMW rider in the morning’s Superpole Race, claiming seventh place. Starting from 13th on the grid, Laverty leapt forward from the start and crossed the line in eighth after ten laps. Van der Mark ended the Superpole Race in 13th, while Folger claimed 18th. In the second race, that featured incidents and falls in the leading group, the BMW riders produced a consistent and error-free performance. As had been the case in Saturday’s first race, van der Mark put on another impressive chasing performance. He started from 14th after the Superpole Race and had already reached the top ten on the second lap. It did not take long for van der Mark to move up to seventh place and he was able to secure sixth spot on lap 15 of 21. Sykes initially fell back from seventh on the grid, but was able to move up again in the second half of the race. He crossed the finishing line in eighth. Laverty made another great start from eighth on the grid, moving up to fifth. Laverty held third place for a short time after Garrett Gerloff (USA) and Michael Ruben Rinaldi (ITA) retired due to a collision. He slipped back as the race continued, but finished ninth to secure his second top ten result of the day. Folger, however, was forced to end his race on lap three due to a technical problem. The third round of the WorldSBK 2021 will take place from 11th to 13th June in Misano, Italy. Reactions after race two at Estoril. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Three riders in the top nine – finishing off the race weekend with this result is certainly something to be pleased about. It was not an easy weekend. Michael produced a very solid second race after he was unfortunately unable to improve at all in this morning’s Superpole Race. Of course, three other riders did take a tumble, but also under these circumstances it’s all about getting a solid result. He put on a great chasing performance and it was good to see that all the BMWs are pretty close to one another. It was a shame that Jonas had to retire. In general, he had a tough weekend. There are still a few things to work on, specifically about finding the drive out of the corners with little grip in these conditions. But I still think that we did really well. We are satisfied, but now we have to take the next step towards the podium. And I am confident we can achieve that over the next three race weekends in Misano, Donington and Assen. On behalf of the whole of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family I would like to express my sadness at the death of Jason Dupasquier and send his family and friends our coldolences. This sad news has overshadowed the race today.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This morning’s warm-up was really good: at least I felt good – I was consistent. Also for the Superpole Race I felt really good, but in warm-up we had changed the bike a little bit. That was good, but as soon as the temperatures went up I struggled a little bit. So the Superpole Race was not that ideal and we even lost two places on the grid. But anyway, in race two the temperatures were much higher than yesterday so we gambled to go for the ‘SC X’ tyre, which was the right choice. The start was a bit messy – I had a good start but in all three races I was a bit unlucky and could not improve my position in the first corner. But at the end I was able to go at quite a consistent pace. I had the chance to follow many riders and I think our bike has made a huge improvement, especially over a race distance and when it comes to conserving the tyre. We just need to find a little bit more drive out of the corners and that should be our next big step to improve on the bike.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The bike was much better today than yesterday. We made a small change and really felt a big improvement on the bike. And again, just struggling, such a shame when fighting for track position. For whatever reason, at the moment we lose track positions to some other riders. The BMW M 1000 RR is certainly strong in some sectors of the track and we are just getting an understanding why. Unfortunately, I got stuck behind some other riders and that gave us an issue today with the braking system. Once I got a clear track, I picked up a lot more speed and found a much better rhythm. Obviously I am not happy with the result but, considering where we were yesterday, it’s a big, big improvement. We definitely learnt a lot on this Sunday afternoon in Estoril and now we need to keep improving.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “It has been a bitter-sweet day, because my speed is there and, honestly, this year the BMW M 1000 RR is such a huge step forward. The Aragón race weekend was my first proper ride on this new bike, so I am still understanding how to get the most from it. This weekend, wow, the bike was fantastic, and in the final race I felt so good to fight with these guys in the first laps and to get up into third position. But in this heat I had to take care of the brakes, so I had to let the other riders’ go and ride in clear air to cool the brakes. Now we will be 100 per cent ready in Misano. These first two rounds have more been like a test, and from Misano on we will start the season properly.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Unfortunately, also today did not go as we had hoped. We had a difficult weekend. That said, things did look a bit better in the final race, even if it did only last for two laps. But we would have made it into the points if everything had gone right. Unfortunately, we had a technical problem. Now we have to look ahead, use the short break and then go back on the attack in Misano.” \n"}

The second round of the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) season is taking place in Estoril, Portugal. It was a Saturday of highs and lows for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. In race one, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’s Michael van der Mark (NED) worked his way up to seventh place with his BMW M 1000 RR. His team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) secured 14th position. Jonas Folger (GER) from BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing crossed the line in 16th place. Eugene Laverty (IRL) from BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse finished 18th, scant reward for the convincing performance he produced in qualifying and during the race. In the morning, Sykes claimed fifth place on the grid in Superpole qualification. Folger was the second-best BMW rider in 11th place, followed by van der Mark in 12th. Laverty had finished the session in eighth place, but was one of many riders whose lap times were annulled due to yellow-flags. Consequently, the Irishman slipped back to 13th on the grid. In the race, van der Mark showed a consistent performance and was able to make gradual progress after starting from 12th. He reached seventh position by the halfway point of the race and was able to maintain this until the chequered flag. Team-mate Sykes was in sixth position right after the start of the race, but the British rider started to fall back after the second lap. After 21 laps, he crossed the finishing line in 14th place. Laverty went off like a rocket from 13th on the grid, moving up to ninth through the first turns. He managed to hold on to seventh place between laps four and nine, before suffering a fall that put paid to his hopes of securing a top result. Laverty did return to the track but had to settle for 18th. Folger lost some places at the start and was unable to make any progress thereafter, crossing the line in 16th. Reactions after race one at Estoril. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “That was a mixed day for us, but nonetheless I am very pleased with Michael’s seventh place. Estoril is always a tricky circuit for us and we had some lost track time to make up for. It was pretty difficult to choose between the ‘X’ and ‘SC0’ tyres today. We took the safe option with both riders. Ultimately, that proved to be the right choice and we produced a solid race. However, seventh place is, of course, not what we are aiming for. Tom fell back a very long way. Now we have to analyse the reasons for this. He lost three or four seconds during the opening laps. Of course, it is very disappointing to finish 14th, 36 seconds behind the winner. That is definitely not our objective. I was delighted for Eugene at the start of the race, but unfortunately he took a tumble when in seventh place. However, the track was relatively greasy and we saw a few incidents like this. For Jonas, it just was not his day and he would otherwise have recorded a better result. In conclusion: It is good to have recorded a solid race and we can build on this for tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We lost some valuable track time again this morning, so that was not how we wanted to start the day. But anyway, in Superpole I felt good; I improved my lap time and then in qualifying I had really good first three sectors, but then the tyre was gone so I could not gain any time in the last sector. That was a pity because that meant starting initially from P14, which was then P12. I had a really good start and the race was my first long run this weekend. I was surprised by the pace I had and with the consistency of the bike. I am happy with this position, but I am happier with the consistency we had and also when I changed some electronics during the race. We took a really good step forward. I am happy with P7 but even more about the whole pace.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a very strange race. I am disappointed. We got a good start and I just tried to go with the guys in front, but every time I opened the gas I lost rear traction. And after a few laps I was losing the rear on corner entry. After making a good start and mixing it in T1 I thought I would get my best rhythm of the weekend, but it wasn’t to be. We clearly need to work on these issues tonight and see what we can do but, yes, it was a very strange race from my side. It was not what we have been expecting and I’m quite disappointed.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Unfortunately, today did not go as I had imagined. It was a difficult race. I struggled to get out of the corners; I had problems with grip. I gave it my all, but I was just too slow. It’s a shame, as I was on the pace in practice yesterday, but we could not reproduce that during today’s race. Now we have to take a look at what caused that.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “All weekend has been fantastic. The feeling of the bike is so good and we had a good feeling in every practice and in qualifying. The reality was that I was eighth fastest but then there was this penalty. In the race, I was very happy with my first laps. I gained positions, I was doing really fast lap times, 1:37.8, 1:37.9 and I was really consistent. Then in corner four, I just asked a little bit too much of the front and crashed. It was my mistake, but I am feeling really good with this bike on a track where last year we were not so strong. So I am optimistic for tomorrow.” \n"}

From a BMW M Motorsport perspective, the 49th staging of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER) on 5th\/6th June 2021 will be full of highlights, both on and off the track. After the victory for ROWE Racing last year, the focus from a sporting point of view is on the mission to defend the title. Four BMW M Motorsport teams line up in the “Green Hell” with seven BMW M6 GT3 and a host of top-class BMW works drivers. They include the BMW Junior Team, which will be making its 24-hour debut in the GT3 class. BMW M CEO Markus Flasch will experience the challenge posed by the Nordschleife for himself at the wheel of the BMW M2 CS Racing. In the run-up to the race, the focus is on the launch of the new BMW M4 GT3 and a very special lap of honour. On the Wednesday before the 24-hour race, BMW M Motorsport will unveil the BMW M4 GT3 in the livery, in which it will contest its first test races over the rest of the year. The car will replace the BMW M6 GT3 as the top car in the BMW M Motorsport range from 2022. On Friday, ahead of Top Qualifying, a replica of the legendary BMW M3 “Eifelblitz” from 1996, built up by BMW M Motorsport, will do an honorary lap of the Nordschleife in memory of Sabine Schmitz, who passed away recently. It will be driven by Johannes Scheid, who won the 24-hour race alongside Schmitz in 1996 and 1997. In the BMW M2 CS Racing, Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH, will don his racing helmet and start in the CUP5 class alongside Jörg Weidinger, Matthias Malmedie and Niki Schelle (all GER). After intensive preparations within the Nürburgring Endurance Series and the 6-hour qualification race, Flasch will be making his debut in the endurance classic. In total, roughly 30 BMW cars are registered for the 24-hour race in eight different classes. Leading the way are the seven BMW M6 GT3 in the top SP9 class, which will be going all out to defend the title and claim the 21st overall victory for BMW. ROWE Racing fields two cars and, as last year’s winners, will sport the prestigious number 1 on one of their cars. The BMW Junior Team, with support from BMW works driver Augusto Farfus (BRA), will be making its 24-hour debut in the top class in a BMW M6 GT3 run by BMW Team RMG. Schubert Motorsport lines up with one BMW M6 GT3, while Walkenhorst Motorsport takes to the grid with three BMW M6 GT3. Quotes ahead of the Nürburgring 24 Hours: Markus Flasch (CEO of BMW M GmbH): “What a fantastic week we have ahead of us! BMW M Motorsport has a programme littered with highlights, both on and off the racetrack, underlining, as ever, how important motorsport is to the BMW brand. With an impressive contingent here at the Nürburgring, BMW M Motorsport is showing that it is alive and kicking in the present. That will remain the case in the future. A symbol of that future is the official presentation of our new GT icon, the BMW M4 GT3, which will conquer the racetracks of this world from 2022. From a sporting perspective, we are very much looking forward to challenging for overall victory with the BMW M6 GT3 in its farewell season, and hopefully to defending the title that ROWE Racing won in 2020. A particular focus will be on the debut of the BMW Junior Team in the GT3 category. Our new entry-level car, the BMW M2 CS Racing will line up in the CUP5 class at the endurance classic for the first time, and I am looking forward to having the opportunity myself to take part in the race alongside my fantastic team-mates. Johannes Scheid’s lap of honour in the BMW M3 ‘Eifelblitz’, built up by BMW M Motorsport, in memory of Sabine Schmitz, is sure to be very emotional. We are honoured to be able to pay tribute to her with this legendary car.” Hans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal ROWE Racing): “We are very proud to come into the race as defending champion. Lining up with the number 1 on the car is very special. The memories of our victory in 2020 are still very fresh. We obviously have ambitions of being out in front again this year, although we know that this is an ambitious goal. However, we are a very well-rehearsed team with an enormous amount of team spirit and we will take our opportunity, should it come our way. I am particularly pleased that we will have fans back at the circuit this year for this remarkable race.” Stefan Reinhold (Team Principal BMW Team RMG): “This is a very special race for me personally and my team. During our time in the DTM, we always tried to get involved in the 24-hour race. Unfortunately, however, it never worked out. Now the wait is finally over, and we are all really excited about our home race. Our approach in the collaboration with the BMW Junior Team has always been to be just as professional as in the DTM. As such, we had high expectations of the boys, but they totally lived up to them. Their lap times are all very good. It was important for us to see that, and gives us another boost ahead of the race. With his experience and speed, Augusto is extremely important to the whole team. He is one of the fastest drivers on the Nordschleife, and knows the processes and the BMW M6 GT3 extremely well. As such, he is not only a great help to the Juniors, but to everyone in the team.” Torsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert Motorsport): “It is nice to be back at the 24-hour race with the BMW M6 GT3 after two years away. Unfortunately, we have not had the good fortune you need to convert our speed into top results in our previous outings. As such, we are really hoping we can bid farewell to the BMW M6 GT3 with a good result this time. We have drivers who know the Nordschleife very well and we have already worked together with the majority of them on numerous occasions. After finishing on the podium at the recent season-opener in the ADAC GT Masters in Oschersleben, we arrive at the Nürburgring full of motivation and optimism.” Niclas Königbauer (Team Manager Walkenhorst Motorsport): “We are delighted to be fielding four cars in this year’s 24-hour race. We are very happy with the drivers in our three BMW M6 GT3 and are confident that we can really make a mark on the race with them. We are also represented with a BMW M4 GT4. We hope the weather gods are kinder to us than they were last year. If so, we will certainly have a very exciting race ahead of us.” The key driver line-ups at a glance. ROWE Racing, #1 BMW M6 GT3:Nick Catsburg (NED)John Edwards (USA)Philipp Eng (AUT)Nick Yelloly (GBR) ROWE Racing, #98 BMW M6 GT3:Connor De Phillippi (USA)Martin Tomczyk (GER)Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)Marco Wittmann (GER) Schubert Motorsport, #20 BMW M6 GT3:Jesse Krohn (FIN)Jens Klingmann (GER)Alexander Sims (GBR)Stef Dusseldorp (NED) BMW Junior Team, #77 BMW M6 GT3:Dan Harper (GBR)Max Hesse (GER)Neil Verhagen (USA)Augusto Farfus (BRA) Walkenhorst Motorsport, #100 BMW M6 GT3:Henry Walkenhorst (GER)Friedrich von Bohlen (GER)Jörg Breuer (GER)Andreas Ziegler (GER) Walkenhorst Motorsport, #101 BMW M6 GT3:Christian Krognes (NOR)David Pittard (GBR)Ben Tuck (GBR)Jörg Müller (GER) Walkenhorst Motorsport, #102 BMW M6 GT3:Mario von Bohlen (GER)Sami-Matti Trogen (FIN)Jörg Müller (GER)Jakub Giermaziak (POL) Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive, #241 BMW M2 CS Racing:Markus Flasch (AUT)Matthias Malmedie (GER)Jörg Weidinger (GER)Niki Schelle (GER) \n"}

Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED) ended race two on Sunday afternoon in fourth and fifth places, just one and a half seconds outside the podium positions. Van der Mark had already impressed with a strong comeback in the morning’s Superpole race. Jonas Folger (GER) from BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing finished eighth to round off a successful Sunday. After enjoying warm and sunny conditions on Friday and Saturday, Sunday started with rain. The circuit was damp in places at the start of the Superpole race, but was also drying out in other places making tyre selection rather tricky. Van der Mark opted for slick tyres, on which he shot through from 15th on the grid to finish fifth at the end of the ten-lap sprint race. The Dutchman also set the fastest lap of the race on his BMW M 1000 RR. Sykes started from third place on the wet-weather tyre, and was initially running in the top five. However, he then fell back through the field and returned to the garage on lap eight as his tenth place on the grid for race two was secure in any case. Conditions were similarly unsettled at the start of race two in the afternoon. Van der Mark (fifth on the grid) and Sykes (tenth on the grid) both opted for intermediate tyres. Van der Mark was battling with the leading group from the word go, and actually briefly took the lead on lap six. He then spent several laps defending second place against Jonathan Rea (GBR \/ Kawasaki). With just a few laps remaining, Rea and his team-mate Alex Lowes (GBR) managed to find their way past him. Meanwhile, Sykes was consistently picking his way through the field and ultimately found himself behind van der Mark. The two swapped positions on lap 16 of 18, meaning Sykes finished fourth, ahead of his team-mate in fifth. Folger ended the Superpole race in 13th place, having started 18th. His big moment came in race two. He and the Bonovo MGM Racing team opted for slicks. Folger initially had to restrain himself and dropped down the field. However, he then launched an impressive comeback. On the final lap, Folger had climbed into sixth place, behind the two riders from the BMW works team. Shortly before the chequered flag, he lost two positions due to a small mistake, meaning he crossed the finish line in eighth place. Eugene Laverty, riding for BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse, was 16th in the Superpole race and ended race two in 17th place. Reactions after race two at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We are very happy. We invested so much work in this project in the winter, and it was very difficult at the tests to establish exactly how we really compared to the others. We got off to a difficult start this weekend, so it is great to be able to turn that around in this way. Sure they were extraordinary conditions, but it was very pleasing to see that we were able to challenge the Kawasakis, which are setting the benchmark, for the full race. There were obviously times in the race when we would have liked to have finished on the podium, but it is excellent that we were able to demonstrate with two or even three bikes that we have the potential to do that. It is a strong result, on which we can build. We are super happy. The work has paid off, but we will not stop here – we will continue to work hard.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “A great day. Yesterday it was a struggle in areas, so I was happy with how we finished the race. Today, I was struggling to see if we could improve on that, but this morning Michael went out in the morning’s warm-up in the rain and was immediately fast considering this was his first ever outing in the wet conditions on the BMW M 1000 RR. In the Superpole race, Michael had a really good run, so to see him come away with fifth was pleasing as he is learning every day when he gets on the bike. Tom had an issue with the rear tyre in the Superpole race so we had to retire but nevertheless we started in P5 and P10 in race two. That race was really exciting, to be battling for the lead and never out of the top-three, top-four places for most of the race was great to see. Both BMWs were in the spotlight and it’s testament to the whole of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team who have brought this bike through. Heading into Estoril we can be confident we can be threat for the rest of the season.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “A bittersweet day, really. We definitely had a Superpole race to forget which we won’t go into too much detail about. That meant that we compromised our start position in race two. For race two, I wanted to go with the slick tyre but after this morning we opted to play it safe on the intermediates. Overall, after a good start, it was a bit of a waiting game. I could see what the guys in front of me were doing but obviously considering the tyres we were on I tried a different strategy to feel where the BMW M 1000 RR was working and where we had to improve. Unfortunately, we just missed out on the podium today, but considering our results here last year it is a huge improvement.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “This morning, we had a wet warm-up session which was my first time on the BMW M 1000 RR in the rain, and to be honest I had such a good feeling from the first lap. The Superpole race was in mixed conditions but I opted to go with the slick tyre and in the end was the right choice. It did however keep raining at times during the race which slowed me down in places but anyway it was a good result for us. This afternoon’s race two again was a gamble on tyre choice, and I knew I made the wrong choice going up to the start as the track was drying so quickly. Despite that we made a good start, had some incredible battles taking the lead but I knew I was asking too much of the tyres and in the end some guys got past me. But we have got to be happy with the two P5 positions and most importantly the experience I’ve gained with the BMW M 1000 RR.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “We are absolutely happy with eighth place in race two. It is class that we managed this at the end of what was a difficult weekend. The conditions were very difficult and we did not know for a long time whether wets or slicks were the best option. We opted for slicks in the end. Only very few others made the same decision, including the winner Scott Redding, and we set the same lap time as Scott. The weather obviously suited us, but we are very happy. Unfortunately, I went wide in the battle with Toprak Razgatlioglu at the end of the race, otherwise we could perhaps have finished sixth. However, eighth place was still the highlight compared to the rest of the weekend, so we are very happy.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “It was not a good day, unfortunately. We had some problems in all sessions. For the long race, I had the wet front tyre and the other riders had intermediates or slick tyres so there was no chance to move further forward. So it was really disappointing but I am looking forward to Estoril already. I said that Aragón and Estoril have been the toughest two tracks for our bike last year so we have a big challenge but we did a good job here yesterday during qualifying so that’s reason for optimism. In Estoril, we need to put our progress on paper because this weekend we weren’t able to get the results we wanted.” \n"}

Making its race debut in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), the new BMW M 1000 RR claimed a top-six result on the first attempt. Tom Sykes (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team ended race one at MotorLand Aragón in sixth place, only two seconds from a podium position. The Spanish circuit is hosting the opening round of the 2021 WorldSBK season. His team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) came home eleventh in race one, after enduring a difficult Saturday. In the first Superpole of the season on Saturday morning, Sykes secured a starting place on the front row of the grid; the Englishman finished third in qualifying. Van der Mark was 15th. In the morning’s free practice, van der Mark could only do one timed lap as a CAN-Bus failure occurred in the supplied tyre pressure monitoring system TMPS, mandatory by FIM, that could not be identified immediately. Sykes lost a few positions in the first lap of the race. For long stretches of the race, he was running eighth. However, he then climbed into sixth in the closing stages, partly being the fastest rider of the field. Van der Mark moved into eleventh place early on in the race, and eventually crossed the finish line in the same position. Jonas Folger (GER) started the race from 18th place. After 20 laps of racing, the rider from BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing finished 16th, missing out on the points by just one position. Eugene Laverty (IRL) from BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse started from 12th and was on course to score points but had to retire with five laps remaining. Reactions after race one at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “I am very happy with our performance. In the end, Tom was just 2.5 seconds off a place on the podium. It was an impressive race. After the issues we had in yesterday’s warm conditions we did pretty well today. In Michael’s case, it is just good that he now has a race under his belt. After his crash yesterday and the technical issue this morning, he was only able to complete multiple laps in qualifying. We must now take a look – it was the first long run he has managed here, and I am sure it will allow us to take another step forward. On the whole, my summary would be: satisfied.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “From where we were in the free practices and in qualifying, I had my personal predictions and I am really pleased that Michael and Tom kind of got where I hoped that they would be. Michael was almost in the top ten after the crash he had in yesterday’s practice and the issue this morning, so it was good for him to get a race under his belt. I think he will come back much stronger tomorrow from that. With Tom I am really pleased; he did a superb job to get third in Superpole. In the race, he went with the ‘X’ tyre which isn’t normally his style, but we convinced him it was the way to go and he got started and become strong when the other guys were battling, managing to bridge the gap. He crossed the line just two seconds off the podium and if you would have asked me before that weekend had started, I would have taken that. So delighted for top-six for Tom, and Michael will do big steps forward. Overall, we are happy.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We came here and we still had some test items that we needed to do and honestly I thing we got a good compromise because we have been trying things in free practice and still got to try to work on a race set-up, so overall I think it was not too bad. I still don’t have the package to do want I want in the first quarter of the race. Then I could see that towards the end of the race that we had quite a good pace, certainly better than the guys in front. It is still early days and to be honest, considering the limitations I felt I had, I think that P6 is not bad. Now we have time to sit down and have a look and make some changes for tomorrow. So overall, it was not a bad start.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We were really unlucky this morning. We lost a lot of time as we had that problem with the bike. At the end, the guys fixed it and I could do one lap in FP3 but still I need more laps after losing yesterday. Superpole was not so bad but it was the first time with a qualifying tyre for me and the bike changes a lot so you have to get used to it. In the race, I had an okay start and the first few laps I was feeling very strong but at one point of the track I was losing too much to stay with the other guys. Just one particular sector. That was a bit of a shame because then I tried to push more and stressed the front tyre too much and started to lose time. But overall it was important to finally do a long distance and we can learn a lot from this. Tomorrow is a new day and with all the information we have now, tomorrow should be better.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was a tough race. We have to find some solutions, as I do not feel comfortable on the bike. It is unfortunate, as we have tried out a lot of things. So far, however, we have not yet found the right set-up. At the moment, we are on a bit of a low. I did the best I could, but it was a disappointing race.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “Qualifying was actually really good, even if a 12th position is not on the front rows, but the bike felt very good. Unfortunately, in the race, we had some small problems from the beginning and in the closing stages something strange happened. The bike stopped and we are still investigating the cause. But the potential of the bike this year is much better. That’s the positive thing I can say. In qualifying the bike was feeling much better than last year here at Aragón.” \n"}

During this year’s Art Basel in Hong Kong, the BMW Art Journey, a joint initiative of Art Basel and BMW to recognize and support emerging and mid-career artists worldwide, is continued with the announcement of the next shortlist. Like a mobile studio, the BMW Art Journey can take artists almost anywhere in the world to develop new ideas and envision new creative projects. The initiative is part of BMW Group’s global cultural engagement celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. Committed in the fields of modern and contemporary art, classical music, jazz and sound as well as architecture and design, the BMW Group has been an integral part of culture on a global scale.Today, the shortlisted artists for the BMW Art Journey 2021 were announced at the BMW Wanchai Showroom in Hong Kong:Julien Creuzet born in 1986; lives and works in Montreuil; represented by High Art, Paris.Kelvin Kyung Kun Park born in 1978; lives and works in Seoul; represented by Vanguard Gallery, Shanghai.Alice Wang born in 1983; lives and works in Los Angeles and Shanghai; represented by Capsule Shanghai.In recognition of the ongoing exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic, the international expert jury conducted its selection process online. Artists and their galleries were invited to submit digital applications, including a short video by the artists explaining their work and artistic process. Since 2020, the circle of eligible artists has broadened and includes not only emerging and mid-career artists from the Discoveries sector, but also artists represented by galleries founded no more than ten years ago at Art Basel’s show in Hong Kong.The shortlisted artists are now invited to develop the proposal for their ideal journey, with the winner to be announced in summer 2021.Members of the international expert jury are Claire Hsu, Director, Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong; Matthias Mühling, Director, Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau, Munich; Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, President, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin; Philip Tinari, Director, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing; and Samson Young, artist and winner of the first BMW Art Journey. “We were deeply impressed with the group of artists we reviewed, and those we selected. Their profiles are very different in terms of practice, research, and expressive modality, and this infuses a great richness to the group. Together, their varied perspectives and ways of working the artistic horizon of the BMW Art Journey,” stated the jury in its unanimous decision.“The Paris-based French-Caribbean artist Julien Creuzet is a traveler between genres and cultures. His hybrid practice includes film and animation, music, poetry and sculpture. His multi-layered assemblages explore different cultural heritages. His gaze on history and on different geographies, on minor and forgotten tales, is important for building new collective scenarios. South Korean Kelvin Kyung Kun Park’s multi-disciplinary work deals with notions of the individual versus the collective, nature versus conditioning – topics that have tremendous potential in generating a research journey across time and culture. His videos, performances, and photographs explore the fundamental structures of those mediums, and of contemporary society. Alice Wang, who lives and works between Shanghai and Los Angeles, makes sculptures and films that take us on epic journeys unfolding across space, time and materials to bring us closer to understanding our place in the universe. Each work tells a different story that transverses the surreal and sublime, leaving us to question what is in fact truth and what is fiction,” notes the jury.Works of this year’s shortlisted artists can be viewed following the announcement in a virtual showroom at “Art Basel Live: Hong Kong” the digital overlay of the fair. As official partner of the show, BMW will host a virtual partner room at “Art Basel Live: Hong Kong” showcasing works and documentations of previous BMW Art Journey winners.Launched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging and mid-career artists worldwide. Past winners of the BMW Art Journey include sound and performance artist Samson Young (presented by a.m. Space, Hong Kong at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2015); video artists Henning Fehr and Philipp Rühr (presented by Galerie Max Mayer, Dusseldorf at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2015); Abigail Reynolds (presented by Rokeby, London at Art Basel's show in Hong Kong in 2016) as well as Max Hooper Schneider (presented by High Art, Paris at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2016), Astha Butail (represented by GALLERYSKE, New Dehli, Bangalore at Art Basel´s Hong Kong show in 2017), Jamal Cyrus (represented by Inman Gallery, Houston at Art Basel’s Miami Beach show in 2017), Zac Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland at Art Basel’s Hong Kong show in 2018), Lu Yang (represented by the gallery Société, Berlin at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2019) and Leelee Chan (represented by Capsule Shanghai at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2021).In collaboration with the winning artist, the journey will be documented and shared through publications, online and via social media.

{"prompt":"Locally emission-free driving fun, variably usable luggage compartments and carrier systems for roof tent mounting make it possible: with the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 and the MINI Cooper SE, the British premium brand offers two models at once for sustainable holiday fun in natural surroundings. ->","completion":" Munich. Holidays in the region and journeys of discovery through the local countryside will continue to be high on the list of priorities for many people seeking relaxation in the summer of 2021. The desire to relax in nature also inspires a preference for camping. These holiday trends are beneficial for the eco-balance, especially when they are combined with sustainable mobility. MINI has two models with electrified drive and matching optional equipment on offer for all those who want to be both flexible and particularly efficient on the road: the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 with plug-in hybrid system and the purely electrically driven MINI Cooper SE Equipped in each case with model-specific carrier systems from the MINI Original Accessories range and a roof tent, they form the greenest camper fleet in the world.With its hybrid-specific all-wheel drive and a system output of 162 kW\/220 hp, the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 is ideally equipped for excursions into the countryside. With the ALL4 Trim or Classic Plus Package, its equipment is supplemented by a roof rail, among other things. A roof tent can be easily mounted on the roof rails with the appropriate railing rack.The MINI Cooper SE can be equipped with mobile night quarters in the same way. The purely electrically powered small car is the only model in its competitive field that can also be equipped with roof rails. The matching carrier system can be found in the MINI Original Accessories range. And you're ready to go. The MINI Cooper SE carries the roof tent swiftly across the country: thanks to the aerodynamically optimised profile of its body, the roof tent does not noticeably restrict the temperament of the 135 kW\/184 hp MINI Cooper SE, which can sprint from standstill to 100 km\/h in 7.3 seconds. The MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 is just as relaxed about the increase in power. As a robust all-rounder, it also masters its role as a touring vehicle with flying colours.On a joint camping trip, the two electrified models reveal their qualities each in their own way. According to the WLTP test cycle, the MINI Cooper SE has a range of 203 to 234 kilometres. The electric range of the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 is up to 59 kilometres. However, it can use the intelligently controlled interaction of the combustion engine and electric motor to replenish the energy reserves of its high-voltage battery on the road.On winding country roads, there is a lot of driving pleasure. The battery, which is located low to the ground in both models, also contributes to this, shifting the vehicle's centre of gravity downwards and thus ensuring even more agility. The MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4, together with the MINI Cooper SE, rolls onto the camping site so quietly that even the crackling of twigs under the tyres can be heard.The cautious approach signals respect for nature. Those who not only hike or cycle there, but also spend the night afterwards, experience it even more intensively - and can enjoy the view of the landscape from their sleeping place in the roof tent. Discovering the world from above - that's even possible from the roof of a MINI.The shelter can be erected at dizzy heights within a few seconds. After releasing the safety catches on the housing, the tent structure lifts up automatically with the help of gas springs. The eight rungs of the fold-out aluminium ladder can be climbed just as quickly. Inside, there are two comfortable sleeping berths. In summer heat, the windows can be rolled up, and thanks to the mosquito nets in front of them, no pests can get inside.Sleeping bags, luggage and provisions for longer camping trips for two can be stored in the luggage compartment of the MINI Cooper SE, which can be expanded from 211 to 731 litres after folding down the rear seat backrest. This provides the same stowage volume as in the conventionally powered model variants of the MINI 3-door. The MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4, with its five doors, five fully-fledged seats and a luggage compartment volume of 405 to 1 275 litres, is a true all-rounder in the premium compact segment.There is therefore also enough space for all kinds of holiday companions that add a touch of comfort to the simple life in the midst of nature. A glance at the digital cockpit display of the MINI Cooper SE and the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 reveals that there is no lack of energy. The charge level of the high-voltage batteries is still well within the green zone. If you have a cool box on board, you can enjoy a chilled drink. The audio system plays subtle music. There is also more than enough power to charge the smartphone. When a mobile espresso machine is added, the threshold from camping to glamping is finally crossed.And if the energy reserves do run low, this is no problem either. Many campsites are now equipped with charging points. So nature lovers can enjoy the beauty of the landscape on a hiking tour without worrying, while their electrified MINI charges up fresh energy to complete the onward journey to the next campsite or the drive home in the most sustainable way possible.\n"}

{"prompt":"Ongoing expansion of the range of sounds for electric vehicles. BMW IconicSounds Electric enriches electric mobility with a fascinating and unmistakable sonic experience. Collaboration with the Academy Award winner produces a new, characteristic driving sound for the BMW i4, the M version of the BMW i4 and the BMW iX. ->","completion":" Munich.The future of driving pleasure is electric, locally emission-free – and characterised by a typically BMW sporting flair expressed not only in dynamic talent, but also through an emotionally rich aural experience. BMW IconicSounds Electric brings an unmistakable sound portfolio to BMW models powered by a fully electric or plug-in hybrid drive system. The collaboration between composer and curator Hans Zimmer and Renzo Vitale, Creative Director Sound at the BMW Group, has produced a distinctive driving sound which customers will soon be able to experience in a version developed specially for electric BMW M cars. “Every BMW has its own character, which is reflected in the sound it makes,” says film music creator and Academy Award winner Zimmer. “So for the electrically driven BMW M models we have developed a driving sound which accentuates their emotional driving experience particularly vividly and ensures their performance can be felt with even greater intensity.”Hans Zimmer had previously been involved in the development of an inspiring ready-to-drive sound for electrically powered BMWs which instils a sense of excitement at the prospect of electric driving when the Start\/Stop button is pressed. The latest chapter in this collaboration covers drive sounds for the BMW iX and BMW i4, including a differentiated sound for the M-specification version of the BMW i4.While the hush of electric driving offers an unprecedented level of comfort, the driving experience loses a degree of emotionality. This is where BMW IconicSounds Electric steps in to put smiles on the faces of customers keen to experience Sheer Driving Pleasure with all the senses. In the future, electric driving pleasure will be enhanced by acoustic feedback to every movement of the accelerator. Like the on-board driving modes selectable at the touch of a button, the driving sound also takes its cues from the driving situation at hand and the driver’s personal preferences. In the basic setting, BMW IconicSounds Electric employs a strikingly transparent timbre with spherical components to convey the basic character of an electrically driven BMW brand model. An immersive and pleasant atmosphere is created initially in the BMW i4 in COMFORT mode. But when the driver steps on the accelerator, the direct relationship between how the car is being driven and the sounds it makes is immediately revealed: the sound experience deepens as load and speed increase. In SPORT mode, in particular, the car’s aural spectrum is more dominant and powerful, the sound providing a constant commentary on the driving situation. Drive system processes are registered within milliseconds and acceleration, load changes or recuperation given a suitable acoustic accompaniment. Only when the vehicle is travelling in ECO PRO mode is the acoustic feedback reduced to nothing. Here, the silence of the drive system underscores the driver’s decision to adopt an ultra-efficient driving style.In the version developed specifically for electrified BMW M models, the drive sound of the BMW i4 is charged with extra energy. Added to which, the differentiation between COMFORT and SPORT mode is especially strong. Overall, the drive system note displays a less harmonious but engagingly rousing and technical sonic profile. Acceleration sparks a rich intensification of the soundtrack’s development, authentically reflecting the car’s performance character. “When you press the pedal of an M car, you suddenly get goosebumps all over your body,” says sound designer Renzo Vitale. “We translated this feeling into a drive sound that expresses a fusion of superior power and flowing energy.”Hans Zimmer and Renzo Vitale had already co-developed the driving sound for the BMW Vision M NEXT revealed in 2019 and the BMW Concept i4 presented the following year. Numerous learnings from this creative process have now been channelled into the design of the sound for future series-produced vehicles.The new drive sounds developed as part of the collaboration with Hans Zimmer are expected to feature in the BMW i4 and BMW iX over the course of 2022. IconicSounds Electric comes as standard in the BMW iX and can be specified as an option for the BMW i4. In cars with earlier build dates, the new sounds can be imported retrospectively via Remote Software Upgrade, should the customer wish. The new spectrum includes one ready-to-drive sound and one stop sound, plus a driving sound which will be made available in the relevant version for BMW models and BMW M cars with electrified drive system.\n"}

ROWE Racing, Schubert Motorsport, Walkenhorst Motorsport and the BMW Junior Team were in action with their BMW M6 GT3s, as were countless other BMW teams in the various classes. The dress rehearsal for the Eifel classic took place in glorious weather, and the teams used the weekend to make preparations in race conditions. The 49th running of the 24-hour race on the Nordschleife will be held on 5th\/6th June. The best-placed BMW car in the final classification of the 24h qualifying race was the #1 BMW M6 GT3 of ROWE Racing. The quartet of drivers Nick Catsburg (NED), Nick Yelloly (GBR) John Edwards (USA) and Philipp Eng (AUT) ended the race in P9, but then moved up into eighth place. Their ROWE Racing team-mates in the #98 BMW M6 GT3 had originally crossed the finish line in this position, but the car with Connor De Phillippi (USA), Martin Tomczyk (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER) at the wheel was disqualified for violating the minimum number of laps per driver regulation. The #20 BMW M6 GT3 of Schubert Motorsport finished in P14. Jens Klingmann (GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Stef Dusseldorp (NED) shared the cockpit of this car. Right behind them in P15 was the BMW Junior Team in the #77 BMW M6 GT3. Dan Harper (GBR), Neil Verhagen (USA) and Max Hesse (GER) are set to contest their first 24-hour race in the GT3 car. They will be supported by Augusto Farfus (BRA) in the cockpit. The #102 BMW M6 GT3 of Walkenhorst Motorsport with Sami-Matti Trogen (FIN), Jörg Müller (GER) and Jakub Giermaziak (POL) finished the race in P18, which also saw them make the top 20. There were also several wins for the BMW teams in the individual classes. Walkenhorst Motorsport won the SP10 class with the #74 BMW M4 GT4. This car was driven by Lance Boicelli, David Thilenius and Charlie Postins (all USA). The other class winners in BMW cars included Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive (CUP 5 with the BMW M2 CS Racing and V2T with the BMW 330i GS20) and AVIA Sorg Rennsport (BMW M240i). Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH, also competed in the six-hour qualifying race. He shared duties in the #241 BMW M2 CS Racing with Matthias Malmedie, Jörg Weidinger und Nikolaus Schelle (all GER). Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive was responsible for the car’s outing. The quartet finished in fourth place of the CUP 5 class. Reactions to the qualifying race for 24h Nürburgring: Philipp Eng (#1 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “The race was a lot of fun. The car felt great, we crossed off everything on our to-do list and completed our programme. We also compared tyres. The atmosphere in the team is really good, we’re all helping each other out and are very open with each other. It’s a lot of fun, and now we are all really looking forward to the big race at the beginning of June.” Marco Wittmann (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “Aside from the subsequent penalty, our race was relatively unspectacular. We started from eighth on the grid and crossed the finish line in the same position. But our focus this weekend was on sorting a few things out for the 24-hour race. I was at the wheel for the qualifying session and a lap of the Nordschleife on your own without any traffic is great fun. You can really push the car to the limit, and that is every racing driver’s ultimate dream. Now we are all really looking forward to the 24-hour race and are hoping for a good result there.” Jens Klingmann (#20 BMW M6 GT3, Schubert Motorsport): “The weekend was hugely important to us, because we are still a little behind in terms of experience, so we needed every kilometre. We weren’t focussed on the result, we viewed the race as a test race, tried to optimise our pace further, specifically for a long run, and to fine-tune the set-up. We learned a great deal and I am confident that we can improve our package even more in the coming weeks, and I’m really looking forward to the 24-hour race.” Neil Verhagen (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team): “I am quite happy with the weekend. We definitely learnt a lot in the 24h qualifying race, which was the main point for us. There are a lot of things that we still need to smoothen out before the 24-hour race, and getting the data and all the experience from this six-hour race definitely will help us a lot to go and push in the big one. We had a very strong car and if we get everything together then the result will come. So there is a lot of positives to take away, and now the team and us will work hard to make sure we are prepared as well as possible for the 24h Nürburgring.” \n"}

In the seventh race of the season in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, Maximilian Günther (GER) crossed the finish line fifth in his adopted country, Monaco (MON). He just missed out on the podium but equalled the best result of the season and scored ten important points in the overall standings. After a tight, thrilling race, Günther missed out on second place by just four-tenths of a second in the #28 BMW iFE.21. Having won the Valencia E-Prix (ESP), Jake Dennis (GBR) suffered back luck this time. A not-at-fault collision early in the race put him at the back of the field and he was unable to score any points. With the first half of the season completed, BMW i Andretti Motorsport is now in fifth place in the team standings with 55 points. Günther finished third in qualifying to reach Super Pole where he secured fifth position on the grid. The BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver was involved in some close-fought duels on the Formula 1 circuit in the principality. He moved up as high as third place and was battling for his first podium finish of the season. Günther fell back to fifth place as drivers attempted to get their ATTACK MODE timings right, but sound energy management gave him the opportunity to make up some ground towards the end of the race. A minor collision saw Günther’s chance of a podium finish disappear however, when Oliver Rowland (GBR, Nissan) clipped him from behind in the port chicane. Victory went to António Félix da Costa (POR, DS Techeetah). Dennis’ first race in Monaco, and the first after his maiden Formula E victory in Valencia, did not go according to plan. Starting from 14th on the grid, he was involved in a not-at-fault accident on the very first lap and dropped to the back of the field. He subsequently also received a drive-through penalty for excessive energy use. Dennis finished the race in 16th place in the #27 BMW iFE.21. The FIA Formula E Safety Car, the MINI Electric Pacesetter inspired by JCW, pulled the field back together around 15 minutes before the end after René Rast (GER, Audi) had retired, ensuring that there would be plenty of excitement in the final stage of the race. Races eight and nine of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E World Championship take place on 19th and 20th June in Puebla (MEX). Reactions to Race 7 in Monaco. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal, team standings: 5th place):“It was fantastic to be back here in Monaco and race on the full track. It’s been a day of mixed fortunes for our two drivers. Fifth place for Maximilian after P5 in qualifying is a very good result. It’s important for him to be back in the points and it’s also a good finish for the team. Unfortunately for Jake it wasn’t the strong result we had hoped for after such an impressive weekend in Valencia. We go into the six-week break now and look forward to continuing our progression up the standings.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 5th place, race result: 5th place, points: 22, driver standings: 16th place):“First of all P5 was a good start position for us. The race itself was very spectacular and very strategic. When do you take the ATTACK MODE, when do you use energy? Every overtaking move was right on the edge. At one point I was running in P3 but then after the ATTACK MODES I ended up in P5 fighting with Jean-Éric Vergne. He slightly touched me in turn 6 and then had the better run through the tunnel to overtake me. To sum it up, a bit of a shame to have missed the podium here, but we had a good race and scored good points. That was important for everybody. All in all it was a positive day in Monaco.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 14th place, race result: 16th place, points: 33, driver standings: 10th place):“My race was a bit unfortunate. I was in the middle of the pack and there was a backlog into turn 7. As I got hit, the car flipped into reverse gear and I lost a lot of time. After that we managed the race and hoped for a safety car. It came out towards the end but it just wasn’t enough to gain a lot of positions. I think the biggest thing we can take away from here is that we learned the track in Monaco. The performance wasn’t that bad. It is what it is and we move on now.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race.

With two weeks to go until the start of the 2021 season in the FIM FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad Motorsport has entered a crucial phase of preparations. MotorLand Aragón, the Spanish circuit that will host the opening races of the year, was the venue for this week’s intensive tests with the new BMW M 1000 RR. Among those attending were the factory team, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, with riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED), as well as the two BMW satellite teams: Bonovo MGM Racing with Jonas Folger (GER) and RC Squadra Corse with Eugene Laverty (IRL). The test was primarily used to test further developments and fine-tune the bikes to the individual needs of the riders ahead of the start of the season. Working closely together, and blessed with ideal conditions in the Spanish sun, the teams and riders gained a lot of valuable information for their final preparations. WorldSBK kicks off the 2021 season with a double-header. The action takes place from 21st to 23rd May at MotorLand Aragón. Round two of the season follows just one week later , at Estoril, Portugal. Quotes after the test at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It was the last test before it really gets serious – on this same track. Again, we had productive days under perfect weather conditions without any large technical issues so we could clearly conduct our test plan. Already, the satellite teams have shown added value for us because we can get more confirmation and we can share the test points so we can get through more work. That is very positive, we still have some homework to do before the first race but I am confident we will get there and already in some areas it’s a clear improvement, like top speed, brakes and so on. Overall I am happy and I am very much looking forward to finally race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was good to get to the final test in pre-season preparation at Aragón. We again had good conditions. I think we have been very fortunate this year with the late start of the season and selecting to start our testing late has paid dividends. On track activities - we have been focusing on chassis and electronic work. I think it is fair to say that we have completed most of that; we have a good direction going into the Aragón race weekend. Lap times are difficult to judge as from starting at ten o’clock to the middle of the day and the end of the day, it is difficult to tell who was running what tyres. But it is clear that the race pace is very strong from last year to this year from the competition and we need to be on point come Aragón race to be in contention for the podium. Nevertheless, we are happy where we are and we look forward to the first round.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a very productive test. We have done such a lot now with the electronics all over, the traction control, the engine brake, the power level maps. We’ve also been working with different chassis configurations and set-up and were also trying some things with the engine. Apart from that it was quite some other fundamental things that we have been trying. So overall, they have been very busy days. A big thanks to the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team that has put in very long hours on all the preparations. We just need to go back now and use all this information but certainly there has been a lot gathered and I really feel we can improve the whole package of the new BMW M 1000 RR. I am looking forward to the first races now.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “They have been fantastic days. All days, the weather was good. On Monday, it was a bit cold but then it got warmer and warmer so we got a lot of different weather and track conditions and this was really good. It was perfect to test here just before the first race. A lot of things to try, a lot of things to improve but I am really happy with the progression we are making. Of course it’s always difficult to see where you are at a test but we will find out at the race weekends. I am looking forward to some good battles again and to fight with the other guys on track.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “That was our final test before the start of the season. We once again used the time to test all our options and directions, from the chassis to the electronics. We learned a lot, so we are well-prepared for the first races.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “First and foremost, I am so happy to be back on a bike after six and a half months off. The big surprise for me was that after this period I was able to get back on my bike and within two exists be on a good pace. So we had three really good days, good weather, surprisingly fast lap times and my main focus has been to improve the baking performance and we did that. So, job well done and I am really happy with my RC Squadra Corse team. Now I am looking forward to the first round here at Aragón after our successful test.” \n"}

The virtual art installation premieres in conjunction with Frieze New York 2021, as well as the 50th anniversary of BMW Group Cultural Engagement. Content and videos documenting its creation process are available today online via www.bmw.com“The Ultimate AI Masterpiece” virtual art installation was created in partnership with creative technologist Nathan Shipley of Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, and Gary Yeh, Art Collector & Founder of ArtDrunk. The duo leveraged Nvidia’s open source “StyleGAN” artificial intelligence software to cross-reference over 50,000 images of artwork spanning 900 years of art history and a curated set of 50 works from renowned and emerging contemporary artists BMW has worked with over the past 50 years. Using these inputs as a basis for understanding art, the artificial intelligence then generates entirely new works of art, merging what it learned from classical art and the styles noted from the contemporary artists. These new works have been projection-mapped onto a virtual rendition of BMW’s range-topping 8 Series Gran Coupe.“For 50 years, BMW has supported the arts and culture through numerous initiatives as a way to engage and interact with consumers around the world in an authentic way,” said Uwe Dreher, vice president of marketing, BMW of North America. “As we continue these efforts into 2021 and look for new and creative ways to engage audiences, we shift to a virtual setting where we are combining centuries-old art and the latest AI technology to create something completely new and exciting.”To document the creative process behind the virtual installation, Shipley and Yeh collaborated digitally from different parts of the world – Yeh in Seoul, Shipley in San Francisco – and virtually joined each other for an engaging conversation on the technology behind the artwork created by the AI, as well as BMW’s decades-long support of the arts. “The Ultimate AI Masterpiece” documentary video is available at www.bmw.com“AI is an emerging medium of creative expression. It’s a fascinating space where art meets algorithm,” said Nathan Shipley. “Combining the historical works with the curated modern works and projecting the evolving images onto the 8 Series Gran Coupe serves a direct nod to BMW’s history of uniting automobiles, art, and technology.”“During an unusually isolated time in history, we took the opportunity to curate and work with artists from around the world as a means to give viewers a true art experience digitally,” said Gary Yeh. “It was particularly exciting to push the boundaries of art, see how technology may influence the art world in the years to come, and build on 50 years of cultural engagement at BMW.”Today, BMW is committed to cultural engagement around the world and takes its social responsibility seriously as a corporate citizen. Over a hundred long-term cultural initiatives in the fields of modern and contemporary art, classical music, jazz and sound as well as in architecture and design have been well established throughout the decades. Together with other partners, the BMW Group developed its own range of partnerships and activations with renowned artists, musicians, designers, curators, initiatives including the BMW Guggenheim Lab, BMW Tate Live, BMW Open Work by Frieze, the BMW Welt Jazz Award, the BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors, the BMW Art Journey and the free concert series Opera for all in Berlin, Munich, Moscow and London.From May 5-9, 2021, Frieze New York runs its tenth edition, taking place for the first time at The Shed in Manhattan. Reimagined for its new location, the fair brings together over 60 major galleries and sees a strong representation from New York, celebrating the creative spirit of the city. A dedicated edition of Frieze Viewing Room will run parallel to the fair, through May 14, and will feature an expanded list of over 160 exhibitors, connecting international galleries and audiences unable to travel. As official automotive partner, BMW will provide dedicated shuttle vehicles for VIP guests.Visitors to Frieze can also explore the latest work of artist collective Random International “Body \/ Light” presented by Arts Brookfield and Superblue at Manhatten West, in walking distance from the fair. The work is inspired by a year-long collaboration with BMW i and the precise, minimalist culture of their design group as well as the technologies enabling the electrification of mobility.

BMW M Motorsport has now taken the next important step in the development of the new BMW M4 GT3. The new flagship in the portfolio of cars from BMW M Motorsport successfully completed a series of test drives on the Nürburgring Nordschleife (GER) on Thursday. The two BMW works drivers Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Jens Klingmann (GER) shared driving duties. The special characteristics of the over 20 kilometres of the Nürburgring Nordschleife make it the perfect testing ground for the development of new race cars. It is a very long track with plenty of options, and its combination of high speeds, fast corners and significant climbs and descents provide everything that BMW M Motorsport engineers require for comprehensive vehicle testing. A race car that emerges from testing on the Nordschleife is well prepared to take on all other racetracks. Thursday's testing focused on gaining initial experience on the most challenging racetrack in the world, especially with regard to the durability of components under extreme levels of stress imposed by the Nordschleife and driving behaviour in those very specific series of corners. First impressions were very positive for the drivers. “The debut of the BMW M4 GT3 on the Nordschleife went very well,” said Klingmann. “My initial feedback is that the BMW M4 GT3 has retained the strengths of its predecessor on the Nordschleife, while eradicating its weaknesses. Of course, it’s not possible to transfer that 1:1 to other circuits from such a special track, but as a driver you feel right at home from the word go in the BMW M4 GT3. It is not unpredictable, but it’s fast nonetheless. It was really great fun.” Farfus said: “It is a great honour for me to be involved so intensively in the development of the BMW M4 GT3, and to have been there for the first laps on the legendary Nordschleife. Many thanks to BMW M Motorsport! It is always special to hit the track for the first time in a new car, as you never know what to expect and how the car will behave. The BMW M4 GT3 made a good impression. The driving experience is very good and we had no technical problems whatsoever on this challenging circuit.” Further testing has been scheduled and the BMW M4 GT3 will return to the Nürburgring Nordschleife at the start of June. Ahead of the 24-hour race, the new BMW M Motorsport flagship will be introduced to the public for the first time. Over the course of the year, the BMW M4 GT3 will also have the opportunity to make its first test appearances under race conditions in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS).\n"}
{"prompt":"With up to 225 kW\/306 hp, chassis technology refined with racing know-how, model-specific design features and sports car flair in the interior, the British brand's top athletes set benchmarks for extreme driving pleasure in both the premium small car and premium compact segments. ->","completion":" Munich. When characteristic driving pleasure rises to a thrilling race feeling, the John Cooper Works logo immediately comes into focus alongside the unmistakable design features of the British premium brand MINI. Each John Cooper Works model combines individual style with challenging performance in its own unique way. The current starting line-up of top athletes includes models from the small car and premium compact segments. Each of them guarantees extreme driving pleasure and fascinating charisma through drive and chassis technology derived directly from motorsport as well as specific design features in the exterior and interior.The connection between MINI and John Cooper Works is based on a decades-long tradition, joint successes in racing and a shared awareness of driving pleasure, individuality and premium quality. Six decades ago, the sports car designer John Cooper paved the way for the classic Mini on the race tracks and rally tracks. Three overall victories at the Monte Carlo Rally helped the British small car to legendary status as early as the 1960s. In the more recent past, the sporting career was marked above all by the six overall successes for MINI in the Dakar Rally.With the current John Cooper Works models, the passion for top performance can also be experienced in everyday traffic. Their technology, developed with racing know-how, and their performance-oriented appearance secure them an exceptional position in their respective competitive environment. As an original in the premium segment of small cars, the MINI John Cooper Works embodies the classic three-door body concept in a particularly sporty form. Exclusive open-air pleasure creates an additional appeal in the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible Both models now enter the race with fresh design accents. The most important changes to the exterior include the reduced surface design at the front, the hexagonal radiator grille, which has gained in size and presence, new side scuttles and a clearly designed rear apron, in whose lower area a particularly striking diffuser now frames the two tailpipes of the sports exhaust system.A 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology ensures spirited power delivery in both models. It generates a maximum output of 170 kW\/231 hp and a maximum torque of 320 Nm. The drive torque is transmitted to the front wheels via a 6-speed manual transmission as standard and an 8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission as an option. The MINI John Cooper Works needs 6.3 seconds (automatic: 6.1 seconds) to sprint from a standstill to 100 km\/h. Its top speed is 246 km\/h. Its top speed is 246 km\/h. The MINI John Cooper Works Convertible accelerates to 100 km\/h in 6.6 seconds (automatic: 6.5 seconds) and reaches a top speed of 242 km\/h (automatic: 241 km\/h).With their chassis technology precisely tuned to the performance characteristics of the engine, the two top sports cars enable an intense performance experience. A sports brake system developed in cooperation with the specialist manufacturer Brembo is just as much part of the standard equipment as the 17-inch John Cooper Works light-alloy wheels. The latest version of the Adaptive Suspension is now available as an option, which with its new frequency-selective damper technology ensures an optimised balance between sportiness and ride comfort.The two John Cooper Works models open up a further dimension of inspiring performance and unrestricted suitability for everyday use for the premium compact segment. With their variable interior space, five fully-fledged seats, the most powerful engine ever developed for MINI models and the ALL4 all-wheel-drive system as standard, they have the ideal prerequisites to enthuse additional target groups for extreme sportiness. The MINI John Cooper Works Clubman combines its extremely sporty character with the individual body concept of a modern Shooting Brake. Four side doors, the two split doors at the rear and the dynamically stretched roofline help it to achieve modern functionality and a lifestyle-oriented appearance. As the largest and most versatile member of the Performance family, the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman is characterised by its robust appearance and particularly generous interior space.The most important thing they have in common is an irresistible forward thrust that comes from the power of a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology. The drive unit develops a maximum output of 225 kW\/306 hp and a maximum torque of 450 Nm. It is combined with an 8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission as standard. In both models, the ALL4 all-wheel drive system takes on the task of distributing the ample drive torque between the front and rear wheels precisely and as required in every driving situation. The system is supported by the mechanical differential lock integrated into the automatic transmission. It acts as a transverse lock to reduce the speed compensation between the front wheels. With a locking effect of up to 39 percent, it promotes traction on unpaved terrain or in adverse weather conditions as well as driving dynamics during sporty cornering.A Brembo sports brake system with four-piston fixed calliper disc brakes on the front axle ensures superior deceleration performance even for the top athletes in the compact segment. Another component of the standard equipment are the 18-inch John Cooper Works light-alloy wheels. Adaptive Suspension is also available as an optional extra for the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman and the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman.In all John Cooper Works models, a cockpit characterised by sporty flair supports the performance experience. The redesigned Nappa sports leather steering wheel with multifunction buttons on high-gloss black surfaces and John Cooper Works logo can be heated as an option. John Cooper Works sports seats with integrated headrests, a stainless steel pedal set, an anthracite-coloured roof liner and a specific gearshift or gear selector lever also come as standard. The standard equipment in the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman and the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman also includes the multifunctional instrument display, which is available as an option in the other two top sports cars. In all models, a new operating system offers optimised options for quick and intuitive control of vehicle functions, audio programme, communication, navigation and apps. Live widgets on the 8.8-inch touch display of the central instrument now serve to activate the desired menu item, which can be selected with a swiping motion similar to that on a smartphone.Two colour worlds are now available for the graphic display on the central instrument and the multifunctional instrument display on the steering column. The \"Lounge\" and \"Sport\" modes offer relaxing blue and turquoise tones and an animating combination of red and anthracite, respectively, which can also be linked to the corresponding settings of the standard MINI Driving Modes for a comfortable or sporty vehicle setup if desired.Newly compiled trims and equipment packages allow the configuration of all John Cooper Works models to be easily and specifically tailored to personal requirements. The John Cooper Works Trim is available as an alternative to the standard equipment. This option includes particularly attractive exterior paint finishes such as Chili Red, Rebel Green, Rooftop Grey metallic or Island Blue metallic. It also includes John Cooper Works light-alloy wheels in size 18 inches for the models in the small car segment and 19 inches for the compact top sports cars, as well as exterior and interior surfaces in Piano Black high gloss and Dinamica\/leather upholstery in Carbon Black.The comfort, connectivity and driver assistance equipment packages offered for all John Cooper Works models have also been carefully put together. New to the range for all top sports cars is the Lane Departure Warning system included in the Driving Assistant. In addition, Active Cruise Control now also includes a Stop & Go function for the MINI John Cooper Works and the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible. It can be used in conjunction with the 8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission and enhances comfort in those situations where a slow flow of traffic temporarily slows down extreme driving pleasure. \n"}

The BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver dominated the Sunday at the DHL Valencia E-Prix (ESP) of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. He secured pole position, led the race from start to finish and celebrated his first victory in only his sixth race in this championship. In an interview, the 25-year old speaks about this success, his learning curve in Formula E, the collaboration with team-mate Maximilian Günther (GER) and looks ahead on the remaining season. What does this win mean to you after the tough start of the season?Jake Dennis: “Getting your first win in Formula E is always something special, it’s obviously your first goal and dream. And being able to do it so early in the season on race six is a cool feeling. Credit to the team for doing such a good job with the strategy to allow me to deliver the results in qualifying and also later in the race.” What were the keys to success?Dennis: “I think having the patience is the key to success. In Formula E it’s very much like a poker game and to trying to understand where to show your car at and where not, I think we managed that perfectly in the race. We pushed where we had to and then we’ve saved energy where we could do and it worked out. That’s why we came from A to B the fastest and that’s why we won the race.” Where do you rank this win in your career? Dennis: “It is definitely one of my best, for sure. I think it was more of a challenge to get this race win. In Formula E, it is so difficult to put everything together, but to get pole position and the race win, I’d probably say it has to be my best day in motorsport in terms of the whole package. But yeah, this race win is definitely one of my favorites so far.” And there was also another reason why that was a special win…Dennis: “Yes, there is a mechanic in the BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team, Chris, who was already my mechanic ten years ago when I was crowned champion in my first single-seater season in the InterSteps Championship. When our paths crossed again when I came to BMW, I sent him a picture of us celebrating together ten years ago in 2011 – of course he had this picture, too – but I sent it to him and wrote: ‘Let’s try and replicate this this year’. And it’s amazing that we’ve managed the same result ten years later, both in completely different scenarios than in 2011. Back then, we were completely unexperienced, him as a mechanic and me as driver. Now we are both at the top of our game, we’re experienced in motorsport now and it was cool to share this memory and this moment with Chris and replicate what we did ten years later. So it only made sense that we had a photo together – a similar one to that from 2011.” Were you more nervous in qualifying or at the race start? Dennis: “I was probably more nervous in qualifying to be honest. It was a big opportunity for me with the drying track conditions and it only takes one small mistake to lose that opportunity. And then going to the start of the race, the pressure was rather low, I didn’t really feel that nervous surprisingly.” How big was the advantage of knowing the Valencia track? Dennis: “I don’t think it was any advantage knowing this track already, I just think it wasn’t a disadvantage. Obviously, everybody knows the circuit and obviously so did I, so it more was the one time in Formula E this season, where I wasn’t at a disadvantage because obviously 90 percent of the field aren’t rookies so they know most of the tracks already. It definitely helps the situation to start the weekend on the right foot and it wasn’t required for me to learn the circuit in FP1 and FP2.” How does the collaboration with Maximilian Günther work? Dennis: “Maximilian and I have a great relationship, he was super happy for me to get the win and vice versa, when his day will come for sure. We work really well together, Maximilian is super professional and detailed on everything. So yes, we have a good working combination and it definitely drives the team forward in a positive manner. We try to get the best out of our package the whole time.” How much did you learn in your first six Formula E races? Dennis: “I’ve learned a hell of a lot in my first six races in Formula E, definitely! We’ve had the full roller coaster experience, we started from the back and came forward, we started from the middle and now literally we started from the front leading every lap and then getting the win. So we’ve had every scenario now and it’s much easier starting from the front, that’s what I have learned, so qualifying is super important. But the whole six races have been a massive learning curve from me and still I have so much to learn in comparison to the other drivers.” What is the biggest challenge in Formula E for you so far? Dennis: “The biggest challenge in Formula E has to be putting the whole weekend together perfectly. It’s so easy to make one small mistake in practice or qualifying or the race and then your day is ruined, so just trying to put everything together and having a smooth weekend and that’s definitely the most challenging part in Formula E.” After you win you said “we’re back in it” – so what are your goals for the races to come? Dennis: “I think we are all back in the hunt, we’re only 22 points behind the lead after six races so we’re definitely there. Back in group two in qualifying now, eighth in the championship, we’ve made a big step forward in the team championship, so yeah, it’s all eyes on for Monaco in a couple of weeks where we will try to get again another big points before we will have a big break afterwards. It’s again a new circuit for me but I’m sure it will be a cool event and I’m very much looking forward driving in Monaco for the first time.” Knowing the whole race calendar now, what venues are you looking forward to most? Dennis: “The two race events I’m looking forward to the most are definitely New York and London. I’m really much looking forward to having my home races as I don’t live too far from London, so it will be for sure something special for me racing there, hopefully with some fans at this point, that would be awesome. And then New York, I always wanted to go to New York in the last ten years but I somehow never made it there and to have the opportunity going there now as a Formula E racing driver racing on the streets of New York is something pretty special to me. I really hope that we get a good result in New York, I think it’s a special race and yeah, just hoping for good weather.” \n"}

Additionally, on the occasion of 50 years of Cultural Engagement of the BMW Group, visitors can experience elements of the BMW Art Car Collection and the 50th anniversary. To visit the exhibition, please register here.The BMW Art Journey is an initiative founded by Art Basel and BMW in 2015, to support emerging to mid-career artists. Latest awardee Leelee Chan (represented by Capsule Shanghai) will document her BMW Art Journey project “Tokens from Time”, tracing material culture from the past, present and future. The artist interprets “tokens” as material objects and their respective historical development which represent the key qualities and feelings of living in societies across different historical and cultural contexts. Inspired by the various materials Leelee Chan worked with on her BMW Art Journey, she created a sculpture which will be on display at the BMW Wanchai Showroom together with images and films documenting her journey.For the first part of her BMW Art Journey, Leelee Chan visited Italy, Switzerland and Germany in autumn last year. During her time in Italy, the artist focused her research on artisan workshops and learning more about the practice of ancient craftsmanship techniques. Therefore, she attended workshops run by local artisans to gain deeper insights into the artistic manipulation of marble, took part in a class at the Mosaic Art School and visited some of the world’s oldest and largest early Christian and Roman mosaics. Additionally, Chan studied the processing of copper with the heirs of ancient family-run workshops, a path that led her to a 1000 years old bell foundry. While travelling across Switzerland and Germany, Chan shifted her focus to the possibilities of future materials and the direct exchange with leading scientists and experts in the field of material science. As part of her journey, Leelee Chan also visited BMW’s headquarters and research centers in Munich as first BMW Art Journey awardee. There, she was able to exchange ideas with experts from the fields of textiles, glass, recycling and design. Chan rounded up her research with a video conference and exchange with the microbiologist Prof. Han Wösten from the field of “Fungal Biology” at the University of Utrecht. Through the artist’s numerous talks and visits to laboratories, she gained a deeper understanding of how engineered materials can play a part of a more sustainable future. Leelee Chan plans to travel further to Mexico later this year to study the symbolic value and meaning of crystals in Maya culture and explore the traditional and artistic manipulation of silver. The further course of her journey strongly depends on the development of the pandemic and will be monitored closely and can be adapted to respect the latest rules and regulations.BMW Art Journey 2021 Shortlist SelectionAn international jury of experts will again select a shortlist of three artists who will be invited to submit their proposals for a journey.

The BMW Junior Team has kicked off its 2021 season on the Nordschleife when Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) contested their first race in the BMW M6 GT3 within the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS). The highlight of the season is the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring (GER) at the start of June, for which the BMW Junior Team is already preparing meticulously. BMW works driver Augusto Farfus (BRA) is supporting the young trio with his wealth of experience. This season, BMW Team RMG is responsible for the team’s outings. After an impressive 2020 season, in which Harper, Hesse and Verhagen enjoyed great success in the BMW M4 GT4, including a class victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours, the three youngsters have stepped up to the GT3 category for their second year of training. The opening round of the season on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife, which was scheduled for the end of March, was cancelled due to snow. However, the BMW Junior Team was able to contest its first race in the BMW M6 GT3 at round two of the NLS. At the end of the four-hour race, the BMW Junior Team ended its GT3 debut in an excellent eighth place overall. Their mentor, Jochen Neerpasch, was full of praise afterwards. “For their first race, that was a very good success,” said Neerpasch. “You have to bear in mind that we have a completely new team. BMW Team RMG is working with the BMW M6 GT3 for the first time and we have three drivers who are behind the wheel of this fast car for the first time. They did very, very well against international opposition here on the Nordschleife.” “We are very happy with the result. It was a good first step,” said Hesse in summary. “The BMW M6 GT3 is great fun to drive. Every lap is cool. The team did a fantastic job. The set-up was just right, which allowed us to feel very comfortable in the car. We just need more laps under our belt, in order to get used to everything and come to terms with the traffic. We should be ready then.” The first race with the BMW M6 GT3 on the Nordschleife was fantastic,” Verhagen added. “I’d like to say a big thank you to BMW Team RMG for all the hard work they put in across the whole weekend. As I come from a single-seater background, I am a little bit familiar with the amount of grip and the forces at play in the car. The BMW M6 GT3 feels superb on the Nordschleife. We will now push hard to improve and get some top results.” “It was a solid race, for the team and us three Juniors,” said Harper. “It was our first race with the team and our first race with the BMW M6 GT3. We finished eighth and set fast lap times. I am really getting used to the car. It is totally different to the cars I had driven before. The step up from GT4 was a really big one, and not just in terms of the car. The standard of opposition we are racing against in the GT3 category is also very high. These guys are so quick, and it really helps to have Augusto as your team-mate. We are learning an awful lot from him.” Farfus is enjoying working with the BMW Junior Team. “They are naturally fast and talented so it is not like I have to teach them how to drive the car,” the experienced Nordschleife driver explained. “It is more about fine-tuning performance and optimising their skills to suit the unique and very specific demands of the Nordschleife. They are doing a fantastic job and have great speed. I am helping them to stay calm, cope with traffic, and understand the new car. I am very impressed by what I have seen so far.” After the third round of the NLS on 1st May, the BMW Junior Team competes in the qualifying race for the Nürburgring 24 Hours on 8th and 9th May. The 49th edition of the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife takes place on 5th and 6th June. With strong partners on the Nordschleife.The BMW Junior Team can count on the support of strong partners for its “Mission 24h Nürburgring”. Shell is the Premium Partner for the #44 BMW M6 GT3 of Harper, Hesse, Verhagen and Farfus. The BMW M6 GT3 will race in the six-hour qualifying race and the 24-hour race itself in the Premium Partner's Shell special livery, which is based on the BMW Junior Team design. Also on board are established partners Endless, BMW M Performance Parts, H&R, Akrapovič, Soft Trim, Puma and Riemensperger.\n"}
{"prompt":"Two body variants, one recipe for success: extreme driving pleasure helps the two top athletes in the premium segment of small cars to achieve unique fascination. With fresh design accents and new equipment features, they now present themselves more attractively than ever before. ->","completion":" Munich. In the race for maximum driving pleasure in the premium segment of small cars, the places in the front row of the grid will continue to be firmly assigned. With fresh design accents and numerous new equipment features, the MINI John Cooper Works and the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible to substantiate the claim to a leading position in this vehicle class even when stationary. The British brand's new, reduced design language expresses the character of the two top athletes more clearly than ever before.In addition to the round LED headlights, the clear and purist design also emphasises the now larger hexagonal radiator grille, which, together with the large side openings, ensures the air supply for the drive and brake system. Another eye-catching feature is the bumper strip, which is now painted in body colour - for example in the new Zesty Yellow variant offered exclusively for the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible. There are also modified side scuttles on the front side panels and the particularly striking diffuser in the rear apron of both models, which has also been redesigned.Fascination for individual style is joined by unbridled enthusiasm right from the first lap. Right from the start, this is ensured above all by the spontaneous power delivery of the 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology, which is located under the front bonnets of both models and mobilises a maximum output of 170 kW\/231 hp and a maximum torque of 320 Nm. It accelerates the MINI John Cooper Works from zero to 100 km\/h in 6.3 seconds with the standard 6-speed manual transmission and even in just 6.1 seconds with the optional 8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission. The MINI John Cooper Works Convertible is close on its heels. Its figures for the standard sprint are 6.6 and 6.5 seconds respectively. Those who press less vehemently on the accelerator can enjoy open-top driving pleasure after just a few metres. The electrically powered textile soft top of the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible - also available as an option as the MINI Yours soft top with woven-in Union Jack graphics - can also be opened while driving at speeds of up to 30 km\/h at the touch of a button and within 18 seconds. In addition to the airstream, the characteristic sound from the two 85-millimetre stainless steel tailpipes of the sports exhaust system flows unfiltered into the interior of the open-top four-seater.No matter whether open or closed: The model-specific chassis technology, which, like the engine, was developed and tuned with the many years of racing expertise of John Cooper Works, ensures extreme driving pleasure, especially when cornering at speed. A sporty suspension set-up is just as much part of the standard equipment of both models as the sports brake system developed in cooperation with the specialist manufacturer Brembo and the 17-inch John Cooper Works light alloy wheels. The four-piston fixed caliper brakes with internally ventilated discs on the front wheels and red brake callipers bearing the John Cooper Works logo enable powerful and precisely dosed deceleration when braking. For further optimised road contact during high lateral acceleration, 18-inch light-alloy wheels are also available as an option, including the new John Cooper Works Circuit Spoke 2-tone design.One of the characteristic features of the John Cooper Works models is the combination of challenging performance and unrestricted suitability for everyday use. The latest version of the optionally available Adaptive Suspension provides an optimised balance between sportiness and ride comfort. It features a new frequency-selective damper technology that operates with an additional valve acting on the traction side. Within 50 to 100 milliseconds, pressure peaks within the damper are smoothed out. This leads to a particularly confident compensation of slight unevenness in the road surface. At the same time, the maximum damping force of the Adaptive Suspension is up to ten percent higher than before, so that steering precision and agility in bends are increased even further.For tailor-made driving pleasure in everyday life and on long journeys, the new equipment packages in the areas of comfort, connectivity and driver assistance can also be provided. These include new options such as heated steering wheel, lane departure warning in the Driving Assistant and the Stop & Go function for Active Cruise Control.The newly designed central instrument cluster with an 8.8-inch touch display in black panel design and integrated audio and favourite buttons comes as standard. The likewise new operating system facilitates intuitive control of vehicle functions, audio programme, navigation, communication and apps. Live widgets are now available for this purpose, which can be selected by means of a swiping motion on the touch display. In addition to the modern graphic display, the operating system also offers new possibilities for individualisation. Two different colour schemes are available for the displays on the central instrument and on the optionally available multifunctional instrument display on the steering column. In \"Lounge\" mode, the display surfaces appear in relaxing shades of blue and turquoise. Switching to \"Sport\" mode causes the screen backgrounds to glow in red and anthracite. If desired, the colour worlds of the displays can be linked to the standard MINI Driving Modes.The fresh touches in the areas of controls and colouring blend harmoniously with the racing-inspired design of the cockpit of both models. John Cooper Works sports seats with integrated headrests, a Nappa sports leather steering wheel with newly designed multifunction buttons, grey contrast stitching and a John Cooper Works logo on the centre spoke, an anthracite-coloured roof lining, a stainless steel pedal gallery and a model-specific gearshift or gear selector lever create a genuine sports car flair in the interior. The John Cooper Works Trim, which is offered as an alternative to the standard equipment, provides a targeted increase in charisma and driving pleasure. This option includes exterior and interior surfaces in Piano Black high gloss, Dinamica\/leather upholstery in Carbon Black for the John Cooper Works sports seats and a particularly high-quality exterior paint finish.

This year’s BMW International Open will once again see a top-class field battle it out for the title at Germany’s most prestigious professional golf tournament. Making his first appearance will be Norway’s rising star Viktor Hovland, who will be taking on a selection of major winners, Ryder Cup stars, tournament legends and an impressive German quartet. The decision whether to allow spectators and, if so, how many, will be taken over the coming weeks in close cooperation with authorities and the European Tour. Until then, tickets will not go on sale. Organiser BMW will offer all golf and sport fans an extensive and multimedia tournament experience.“After the unavoidable cancellation of the tournament last year, we are delighted that Munich will host world-class golf again in June, and that we are able to continue the history of the BMW International Open, which stretches back as far as 1989,” says Christian Masanz, Head of Sports Marketing BMW Germany. “Recent months have shown that professional tournaments can be run safely with appropriate concepts in place. Health and safety takes top priority, even if this unfortunately means that we are unable to allow as many spectators, if any at all. We are working closely with the European Tour and authorities on various scenarios.”The following players have already confirmed their participation in the 2021 BMW International Open:Martin Kaymer: In 2008, the two-time major winner won the 20th BMW International Open at the age of 23 years and 177 days. This makes Kaymer the youngest winner in the history of the tournament, and the only German to lift the coveted trophy.Viktor Hovland: The rising star from Norway is set to make his debut in Munich this year. At just 23 years of age, the world number 15 (as of 19th April) has already established himself among the very best in the world and has his sights set on a first Ryder Cup appearance this year.Padraig Harrington: The current European Ryder Cup captain and two-time major winner is a welcome guest at the BMW International Open. The Irishman may not have won the tournament yet, but he and Retief Goosen came very close in 2006, missing out in a play-off to eventual winner Henrik Stenson.Sergio García: The 2017 Masters winner was part of an all-Spanish play-off in 2011, which went down in the annals of the BMW International Open as the most dramatic conclusion in the history of the tournament. In the end, García had to settle for second place behind Pablo Larrazábal.Bernd Wiesberger: The Austrian has claimed eleven tournament wins over the course of his career – however, victory at the BMW International Open is still missing from his collection. His best result to date: fourth place in 2013.Louis Oosthuizen: At the start of the millennium, the South African was a regular guest at GC München Eichenried. However, he has yet to claim a top-ten finish. The biggest success of his career so far came at the legendary Old Course in St. Andrews, when he won the Open Championship in 2010.Rafa Cabrera Bello: The Spaniard is a popular regular at the BMW International Open and has been in contention at Germany’s most prestigious tournament on several occasions. In 2010 he was third. Four years later, he went one better, finishing runner-up after a play-off.Thomas Bjørn: With two wins to his name, the Dane is the joint record winner of the BMW International Open alongside Paul Azinger, Pablo Larrazábal and Henrik Stenson. The 2018 Ryder Cup captain won the tournament in 2000 and 2002.Andrew Johnston: “Beef” made his debut at the BMW International Open in 2012. Since then, the Brit has regularly featured in the high-class field – and has always been hugely popular with the fans at the course. Alongside the German contingent, Johnston is always one of the crowd favourites.Stephan Jäger: The man from Munich, who grew up around the corner from the venue in Eichenried, returns home again in 2021. In April, Jäger celebrated his sixth tournament victory on the US Korn Ferry Tour – and he would love to repeat the feat on the European Tour.Alex Cejka: Second place in 2003, third in 2004 and 2010: Alex Cejka regularly hits top form at the BMW International Open. Now 50 years old, he played at the inaugural tournament back in 1989.Max Kieffer: A BMW International Open without Max Kieffer? It’s hard to imagine! Kieffer is in excellent form: just two days ago, the German narrowly missed out on his first European Tour victory, coming up just short in a play-off.As well as a total prize purse of 1.5 million euros and 2,750 Race to Dubai points, the pros will also have their sights set on a spectacular Hole-in-One Award at the BMW International Open.

The BMW Group’s #NEXTGen 2020 streaming event excited fans of the BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad brands around the world, but also impressed experienced design experts. Indeed, a jury assembled by the German Design Council named the innovative presentation format as an iF Design Award 2021 winner in the Communication discipline. The Gold Award – the highest distinction in the competition – was presented to the virtual design world premiere of the BMW iX which, as the highlight of #NEXTGen 2020, attracted particular attention. The jury noted that the reveal for the BMW Group’s new technology flagship had set new standards in communication: “Thanks to BMW, fully digital events have levelled up. Innovative and mysterious, this is high-end, state-of-the-art programming for our times. What a beautiful and inviting way to introduce the new fully electric BMW iX.”Public curiosity in the BMW iX was stoked ahead of #NEXTGen 2020 by the informative and entertaining “Chasing iNEXT” infotainment series produced in the style of streaming platforms. The innovative unveiling was then staged in a specially created aesthetic using sophisticated studio technology and virtual effects. “The design team of the fully digital streamcast event #NEXTGen 2020 by the BMW Group pushed virtual production to the max by adding augmented reality layers, as well as creating beautiful design-worlds,” continued the statement from the iF Design Award jury.“We are delighted to receive the Gold Award and would like to express our sincere thanks to the jury,” said Alexander Bilgeri, Head of Corporate Communications Strategy, Messaging, Communication Channels for the BMW Group. “Our infotainment series ‘Chasing iNEXT’ and the presentation of the BMW iX were key elements of #NEXTGen 2020. We opened doors for the film crew to our development departments which otherwise remain closed, and this enabled an unprecedented delve behind the scenes of our Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ). The design presentation of the iX provided the grand finale of ‘Chasing iNEXT’, and the iF Gold Award is a fantastic compliment to all BMW Group employees.”Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand Experience, adds: “A massive thank you to the jury. The development of #NEXTGen in 2019 gave the BMW Group a new and innovative in-house format which could underpin our claim to innovation leadership in the field of communication as well. #NEXTGen offers us a high degree of creative freedom when it comes to communicating our philosophy and our content on the BMW Group channels and those of its brands. We are breaking completely new ground and adapting our communications activities to the landscape of the digital age and our customers’ requirements. This involves setting new trends and we are delighted to have won this important prize.”With the presentation format chosen for #NEXTGen 2020, the BMW Group factored in both the technological possibilities of the digital era and the requirements of the ongoing pandemic. The content released online to date, which can be accessed at www.bmw.com\/nextgen, provides a far-reaching insight into the FIZ. Presented alongside the BMW iX were a series of other trailblazing vehicle concepts, such as the MINI Vision Urbanaut and BMW Motorrad Concept CE 04, as well as fascinating and entertaining video clips focusing on artificial intelligence, the new BMW Driving Simulation Centre, electric drive systems, connectivity and virtual collaboration. Film contributions, interviews and panel discussions provided background information on the latest technologies, collaborations and future trends involved in shaping the face of individual mobility in the future.The BMW Group also collected six other iF Design Awards this year. “The BMW Individual – Symbols of Suprematism” campaign and the artwork for “THE 8” earned the company two further distinctions in the Communication category. The BMW i Interaction EASE was presented with an iF Design Award in the Professional Concept discipline. And the BMW Concept i4, BMW M4 GT3 and BMW iX all gained recognition for their design excellence in the Product category. The iF Design Award is regarded as one of the world’s most prestigious seals of quality for outstanding design achievements.

BMW is once again partner of some of the top Esports teams in the world this season. Cloud 9, FNATIC, FunPlus Phoenix, G2 Esports and T1 will be competing in the classic League of Legends game in BMW colours, where they will regularly do battle for wins and titles. On Wednesday, OG Esports – a world-leading team in Dota 2 and on other platforms – was announced as new ‘United in Rivalry’ partner team, thus BMW will also play an important role in Esports outside the League of Legends cosmos. Now the teams are off on a very special journey together; in Japanese artist Acky Bright’s manga, they are the heroes in a fantasy world. They can only make it through the adventures that await them there as one, despite being rivals – making them ‘United in Rivalry’. “The superheroes in our manga not only develop great power in their adventure, but they also inspire the imagination of every single person,” said Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand Experience BMW. “There is something magical about manga; it touches peoples’ hearts. That is the crux of the matter. Manga follows our goal of wrapping brand messages in emotions – with great finesse for images, language and symbols – and entertaining people. In pop culture like the Esports scene, this is far more effective than another display ad. Through manga, we are communicating on the same wavelength with a target group that does not actually respond positively to advertising, and we are there, where they are – on their mobile devices. With Heroes of Rivalry we are initiating the next stage and not just fuelling the Esports hype, but getting actively involved. I am really looking forward to BMW’s second year in Esports.” The BMW Esports teams’ story is set in the well-known manga genre of Isekai, in which real-world heroes master challenges in a parallel fantasy environment and have to survive fictional dangers. The manga art form that originated in Japan and Korea – where it’s called ‘manhwa’ – is experiencing a global boom. The fan base is growing rapidly, and leading streaming services are investing heavily in the manga related anime market. Manga are very different from western comics, with one difference being the opposite reading direction of the 100-or-so-page magazines, which is from right to left. Many manga are published as episodes in periodical magazines before being bundled together as a standalone volume. There are eight episodes of ‘Heroes of Rivalry’ in total that will be released on the BMW Esports social media channels and on www.bmw.com\/heroesofrivalry. The concept and the storyline for ‘Heroes of Rivalry’ came from Jung von Matt based in Hamburg, while the artwork came courtesy of popular Japanese illustrator and manga artist Acky Bright. Bright started out as a graphic designer and developed his own unique design, illustration, livepaint and manga style, which made him stand out from other mangaka, and has earned him a loyal fanbase. He founded his own studio, Brightworks, for design and ad campaigns and is a partner in cool-Japan art company Tokyo Direct, which co-produces manga, licenses work internationally, arranges artist events such as live-painting and engages social networking activities. OG Esports celebrates debut in ‘Heroes of Rivalry’ manga.BMW Esports presented its sixth partner team OG Esports to fans as part of the ‘Heroes of Rivalry’ campaign. The European team will fly the BMW colours in the game Dota 2. OG Esports was founded in 2015 and won ‘The International’, the most important and most lucrative tournament of the season, in both 2018 and 2019. The team was awarded a total cash prize of around 27 million US dollars for those two victories at the Dota 2 world championship. In addition to Dota 2, OG Esports is represented by strong teams in other games – including Valorant. “OG Esports is giving the United in Rivalry family another boost,” said Ponikva. “As well as League of Legends, we are now also involved in Dota 2 – and with an absolutely top team. This is another step towards realising our vision of immersing ourselves deep in the pop culture of Esports and expanding our involvement in this unique scene with a very specific language, and specific references and symbols.” “I grew up with a poster of a BMW motorcycle on my wall... Many years later... being able to work with them, it’s a dream come true,” said JMR Luna, CEO of OG Esports. “BMW is a wonderful brand and company, and they entered Esports partnering with five of the biggest Esports orgs in the world and it is an honour for us to be part of this prestigious group now. Once again thank you to our fans for continuing to believe and support us, and OG and BMW will now work hard to bring many more incredible moments to you all.” Dota 2, like League of Legends, is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game and the successor of the popular ‘Defense of the Ancients’ modification of the strategic game ‘Warcraft 3’. The game was released as a free-to-play title on 9th July 2013. Dota 2 had more than 11 million monthly active users around the world in January 2019. OG Esports was the first team to win four major titles in Dota 2 back in 2017, and the first team to defend their World Championship title in ‘The International’ in 2019. About BMW Esports.BMW has been collaborating with five of the world’s best teams as a partner in the classic League of Legends game since 2020.

The handling on different tyre compounds was also evaluated, and the team worked on configuring the bikes and the electronics to the individual needs of the riders. The 2021 WorldSBK season starts from 21st to 23rd May at MotorLand Aragón in Spain. Quotes after the Barcelona test. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We were able to work through an extensive programme and test out a lot of things and settings over the course of the two test days. The feedback the riders have given us, on the developments we have implemented over the past few weeks and here at the test, has been positive. It is always exciting to take to the track with a new bike and alongside the competition for the first time, and to see where you stand in comparison to them. We are moving in the right direction with our new BMW M 1000 RR, although we obviously still have some homework to do. We will do that now and work on improving all areas of the new bike and fine-tuning the riders’ individual set-ups.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been another positive test after Jerez. Both riders, Tom and Michael, have continued to work through chassis and electronic set-ups. Lap times have not been particularly important although it is good to be against the competition to see where we are. We still have some work to do. Both riders had no major technical or any other issues to be concerned with. I think durability, performance and the whole team as a group working together has been the positive. We are pleased to leave the test in good shape and are looking forward to our test in Aragón.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a very useful test. We’ve been able to find out a lot more about the new BMW M 1000 RR and we definitely gathered a lot of information. We’ve made a good step forward in terms of the engine performance and certainly a couple of other areas on the bike but I would still like to work on traction from the chassis and we are looking at a few different options already. For me, it was good to add two more days of testing to the bike. It is still very new and coming here against our competition, we were able to see exactly where we need to improve. So it was a very, very useful test and I am happy to get this information under our belt and build on that. The whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has a few weeks now where we can work with the information we have gained over the past two days.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been good to be on track again, especially with the other competitors. We still have a lot of things to try and to discover on this bike especially for me. Sometimes it’s not easy but we found some positive things on the bike and there is a lot of data. Overall, we had two days of testing with hardly any problems which is really important for us because so we could do a lot of laps in order to improve the bike for the next test.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “The test started very well on the first day. After the Jerez test, there had been some new developments regarding the electronics. The support provided by BMW is great and it helped us a lot to make such a step in the development between Jerez and Barcelona. I was very happy with the behaviour of the BMW M 1000 RR. As a result, we had a great base for our work from the first lap on. On Wednesday, we tried a lot with the electronics and also the one or other thing at the chassis. On Thursday, we more focused on tyre performance, to see how long the tyre lasts respectively what we need to do over the distance of more laps. Overall, I am very happy with the job we did here as a team and I really enjoyed riding.” \n"}

Preparations entered their final stage this week with the two days of Pré-Mans testing. The team, with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR and riders Markus Reiterberger (GER), Xavi Forés (ESP), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Kenny Foray (FRA), completed a comprehensive test schedule. The BMW M 1000 RR is the new competition motorbike for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. The team has been working on development of the racing version specially for endurance events over the past weeks, in the workshop and on the track. At official Le Mans pre-testing on Tuesday and Wednesday, the team concentrated on fine-tuning the #37 bike to meet the specific challenges of the classic endurance race on the Sarthe. The pace was strong; the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team set the fastest time on both days including new lap records. The 2021 season in the FIM EWC consists of five events. The 24-hour race at Le Mans is followed on 23rd May by the 8-hour race at Oschersleben (GER), the home race for BMW. The season continues on 17th July with the 12-hour race at Estoril, Portugal. The Bol d’Or 24-hour classic will take place on 18th\/19th September at Le Castellet (FRA). Suzuka in Japan will host the 8-hour-race that represents the season finale on 7th November. Reactions to testing at Le Mans. Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The test was really good. For me, it was the best test since we started this project. It is a very young project and we are still a new team. We had some small issues but this always happens and is okay. One important thing was that we had a very good choice of tyres; Dunlop did a very good job. In combination with the suspension, we found a really good set-up for all four riders. Overall I think that we are really fast going into the race, but we have some work to do prepare all the small parts we have. I am very happy with this result and it provides of course some perspective for the race.” Markus Reiterberger: “It has been a very positive test for us. We have tried several things on Tuesday that we implemented on both test bikes on Wednesday. Then on Wednesday morning, we made very good use of the high grip level in still cooler temperatures and all of us set extremely fast times with a race set-up. A 1:35.1 in race trim indeed is sporty fast, I would say. We managed to set some fantastic laps but it is not only the lap times that count. The pace is important, the pace of all riders, and it is very strong. We found a set-up that enables all riders to go a constant good pace. I want to thank the team for all the hard work. We are already pretty well prepared even if there is more work to do before the race, as always. I think that we can look forward to the 24-hour race at Le Mans with a very good feeling.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “Overall, we are really happy. Our team set the lap record, all riders went the same speed. We are also happy with the race simulations. I did five of them and the pace was incredibly fast – one and a half second faster than the top riders are here normally. We only had a lot of traffic on the track with slower riders and as a result we could not use the full potential of the grip of new tyres for a fast lap. So all of us did their fast times in race simulations with used tyres. I think, overall we are ready and looking forward to the season.” Xavi Forés: “It has been two productive days of testing for us, especially as it was the last test before the race and we were working on setting up the bike for all four riders to be on the same level lap by lap. I think we did a really good job on that. Overall, the two days were very good, because we had a nice pace and did really fast laps, breaking the lap record – especially on the second day on almost every single lap so I am really looking forward to the race. I hope the weather stays like we had it on this couple of days but I think we have a strong package even in cold conditions. Especially the tyres are working really well. The team worked really hard to give us the best possible package and we will now try to do our best at the race.” Kenny Foray: “It has been two good days. I enjoyed riding the bike a lot and my team-mates have been incredible on the track. My feeling was very good at the end of the two days. I think the team is well prepared.” \n"}

The BMW Group will be accelerating its expansion of e-mobility in the coming years. By 2030, at least half the company’s global sales are expected to come from fully-electric vehicles. This will also increase the need for lithium, an important raw material for production of battery cells. For this reason, the company will source lithium from a second leading supplier, US-based Livent. The value of the multi-year contract will total around 285 million euros. Livent will supply the lithium directly to the BMW Group’s battery cell manufacturers from 2022 on.“Lithium is one of the key raw materials for electromobility. By sourcing lithium from a second supplier, we are securing requirements for production of our current fifth generation of battery cells. At the same time, we are making ourselves technologically, geographically and geopolitically less dependent on individual suppliers,” said Dr Andreas Wendt, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network.The BMW Group already signed a contract for the procurement of lithium from so-called hard-rock deposits at Australian mines back in 2019. Now, the company is broadening its supplier base and additionally sourcing lithium from Argentina, where the raw material is obtained from brine from salt lakes. Livent employs an innovative method, that emphasises sustainable water use and minimises the impact on local ecosystems and communities. The company will also contribute important data to the study of sustainable lithium mining initiated by the BMW Group.The BMW Group sources critical raw materials like lithium and cobalt directly from producers and makes them available to its battery cell suppliers. In this way, the company creates complete transparency over the origin and mining methods of the material. Sustainable lithium extraction in ArgentinaThe salt lakes in the border region between Argentina, Bolivia and Chile are home to roughly half the world’s lithium reserves. In conventional lithium mining, brine from the layers below the salt lakes is pumped out of the ground and evaporated in shallow basins.Livent obtains lithium from a brine resource in northern Argentina, using a proprietary method that is particularly sustainable. To minimise the impact on the surrounding ecosystem, most of the brine used is returned directly to the surrounding habitat and not evaporated. This largely preserves the balance between the brine layers and groundwater layers. Solvents and other chemicals do not come into contact with the environment during this process. It also takes up much less space, since evaporation basins are barely used. The company is also involved in local educational programmes and infrastructure measures. Lithium water study in cooperation with University of Alaska Anchorage and University of Massachusetts AmherstThe BMW Group and BASF commissioned a scientific analysis of the water use of different lithium mining methods in South America from the University of Alaska Anchorage and University of Massachusetts Amherst in late 2020. The study will investigate the impact of lithium mining on local water resources and the surrounding ecosystems.The aim is to improve the scientific understanding of the relationship between fresh water and lithium brine aquifers, to evaluate different technologies and thus provide the foundation for assessing sustainable lithium mining. The study will provide companies with a scientific basis to make more informed decisions on sustainable lithium mining in Latin America. The results of the study should be available in the first quarter of 2022.Working towards strict IRMA standard for lithium miningThe BMW Group became the first automotive manufacturer worldwide to join the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) in early 2020. IRMA is a multi-stakeholder governed initiative that has developed guidelines for responsible extraction of raw materials and defined strict requirements for meeting its environmental and social standards. The BMW Group has set itself the goal of having mining suppliers certified according to this standard in the future. On the recommendation of the BMW Group, Livent has now become a pending member of IRMA, signifying its commitment to undergo a third-party audit in IRMA. Livent is the first company with mining operations in Argentina to have made this commitment, and one of the first lithium mining companies in the world to do so. BMW Group ups the pace of electromobility expansionThe BMW Group will already have about a dozen fully-electric models on the roads from 2023. Between now and 2025, the BMW Group will increase its sales of fully-electric models by an average of well over 50 percent per year – more than ten times the number of units sold in 2020. By the end of 2025, the company will have delivered a total of around two million fully-electric vehicles to customers.Based on its current market forecast, the company expects at least 50 percent of its global sales to come from fully-electric vehicles in 2030. At this point, there will no longer be any segment position in the BMW Group’s entire product portfolio where the company does not offer at least one fully-electric model. The company will also be capable of handling a much larger percentage of fully-electric vehicles if demand develops accordingly. In total, over the next ten years or so, the BMW Group will be releasing about ten million fully-electric vehicles onto the roads.\n"}
{"prompt":"Munich. The MINI Electric Pacesetter inspired by JCW is the new Safety Car for the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship race series. As such, it connects the brand’s electrified future with the rich racing history of John Cooper Works. The car was created out of the new MINI Cooper SE as part of an unprecedented collaboration between MINI Design, BMW Motorsport, the FIA and the Formula E.  ->","completion":" Electric drive meets John Cooper Works.“We have already shown how well driving fun and electric mobility go together with the MINI Electric,” says Bernd Körber, Head of MINI. “However, the MINI Electric Pacesetter inspired by JCW goes at least a step further and blends the performance character of the John Cooper Works brand with electric mobility. This extreme version of the MINI Electric has been developed as the Safety Car for Formula E, so is clearly not intended for use on public roads. But it does reveal one of the directions we could take with the electrification of the JCW brand. For me, the message is clear: electrification and John Cooper Works are a good fit.”Dynamism maximised – the exterior design. The exterior of the MINI Electric Pacesetter inspired by JCW has been purpose-built for life on the track and represents the most dynamic interpretation yet of a MINI with all-electric power. “The design is an exciting symbiosis of technical precision and emotion,” explains Oliver Heilmer, Head of MINI Design. “Here, function dictates form, and many design elements have been shaped by technical considerations. For example, we worked closely with our colleagues at BMW Motorsport to develop the form of the wheel arches and front and rear aprons, and the optimisation programme for them included weight-saving measures. This visually striking, technically precise design language gives the car its pervasive sense of emotional engagement and excitement.”At the front of the car, classical MINI icons such as the circular headlights and hexagonal radiator grille create the familiar, easily recognisable MINI face. At the same time, signature John Cooper Works elements, such as wheel arches adapted to the car’s track width and the deep front apron with additional front splitters to the left and right, enhance the sporting visuals of the front end. The blanked off “radiator grille” and MINI Electric logo point to the electric “heart” of the Safety Car. As virtually no drive system cooling is required through the upper area of the grille, the front end is largely enclosed to aid aerodynamics. The only exceptions are the area below the grille and the eye-catching, almost squared-off apertures for brake cooling. The Safety Car’s white flashing lights are integrated harmoniously into the bonnet. Characteristic MINI bonnet stripes extend over the roof to the rear end.Showcasing MINI’s racing genes – the flanks.The MINI Electric Pacesetter inspired by JCW also cuts an extremely dynamic figure from the side. The interplay of geometrically accentuated spats (with carefully placed aero edges) and sporty side skirts gives the car the appearance of powering forward even before it turns a wheel. Together with the increased-diameter wheels, which almost fill the wheel arches, these elements strengthen the time-honoured MINI “stance on the wheels”. The spats and spoilers are made – or more precisely 3D printed from recycled carbon fibre – in Oxford. Yellow accent lines and surfaces on the aero elements (e.g. the spats, skirts and rear wing) provide a nod to the airflow optimisation taking place in these areas and add a visual flourish to the air deflectors and aero edges. The lightweight 18-inch forged wheels in bi-colour black-neon\/orange design bring significant visual depth and added intricacy to the four-spoke items from the MINI John Cooper Works GP.The respective colour worlds of the MINI Electric and John Cooper Works brand merge into a single statement here. The main body colour is a matt silver which extends back beyond the centre-point of the car. A high-gloss wrap with a two-stage colour gradient – from Highspeed Orange to Curbside Red met. – then covers the rest of the body to the rear. The contrast between matt and gloss surfaces brings extra smoothness to the silhouette, while the clear, diagonal separation lines between the different colours injects further dynamism. On the flanks, a chequered flag-inspired pattern shares the stage with a large MINI Electric logo, which can also be found in the radiator grille, on the roof and at the rear end. The Safety Car brief also brings regulations-specific and sponsor-related graphics, which add further visual intensity to the car’s racing character.Broad and eye-catching – the rear.The rear end in black and Curbside Red met. uses yellow accent surfaces to extend the eye-catching design language from the front end and flanks, and makes an extremely modern and dynamic statement. The prominent roof-mounted rear wing with air through-flow and yellow accent lines also integrates the signal light unit and was 3D printed at Plant Oxford. The flared wheel arches accentuate the car’s wide track and transition seamlessly into the pronounced rear apron. The rear apron has cut-outs around the wheels, clearing the view to the higher-grip racing tyres. Between the wheels sits an unadorned diffuser. When the car is viewed from this angle, the accents in Energetic Yellow and lack of exhaust tailpipes identify this as a car powered by an electric drive system.Maximum reduction – the interior.The interior is stripped back to the absolute essentials; only the front seats remain. The driver’s area consists of a certified seat with six-point belt approved for both racing and road use, a steering wheel with minimalist-design carbon fibre impact absorber and a digital instrument cluster. The central information display makes way for a carbon fibre cover here to further reduce weight. The centre console houses the gearshift lever, handbrake and controls for the necessary signal lights – all in exposed carbon fibre. The likewise pared-back carbon-fibre door panels with window and door openers contain cloth straps to make closing the doors easier. Another central feature of the interior is the welded-in roll cage, which maximises safety. And the remainder of the stripped-out interior structure is also painted in typical racing white (for functional reasons).Bespoke 3D-printed parts for the interior.The steering wheel’s minimalist impact absorber and the boost panel on the right-hand side of the wheel are high-quality, custom-made components, likewise the centre console cowling and door panelling on the driver’s side. Another highlight are the removable pads on the sport seat, which are likewise 3D-printed and whose innovative structure combines comfort, robustness and modularity. The thickness, hardness and colour of the pads can be adapted as required according to the physiognomy, weight and personal taste of the driver at hand.Ready for the racetrack, helped by knowhow from BMW Motorsport.Behind the visually powerful design of the MINI Electric Pacesetter inspired by JCW lies the expertise of BMW Motorsport. Rigorous adherence to lightweight design principles gives the Safety Car a kerb weight of approx. 1,230 kg – which makes it approx. 130 kg lighter than the standard MINI Cooper SE. The drive system – also based on that found in the MINI Cooper SE – produces 135 kW and 280 Nm battle it out for victory in their BMW iFE.21 racers.“Agility, performance, a cool looking car: the MINI Electric Pacesetter Safety Car for the FIA Formula E World Championship has got it all,” said Correia. “It’s very fun to drive, it feels like karting.”\n"}

BMW Group South Africa supports the Fine Arts through a unique collaboration with the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) School of Arts in Johannesburg. The BMW Group Midrand Campus lent itself as the perfect canvas for the art students, as a site that was recently completely upgraded and refurbished. The Art Project is part of the BMW Group Building Projects that have already benefited over 500 students from around the globe for more than three decades.Chief Executive Officer of BMW South Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa Peter van Binsbergen expressed his enthusiasm over the Art Project and its results: “We are thrilled to have the Wits School of Arts and its talented students on our list of collaborators. The results of this successful partnership are thought-provoking works that enhance the interaction between guests and associates, alike, with the revamped campus.”Wits School of Arts Associate Professor David Andrew acknowledged the value of the project saying: “This has been an extended learning opportunity for the students, developed within the longstanding practices established at the Wits School of Arts, while taking into account the context in which they have been required to work. All pieces are on permanent display and I am looking forward to seeing how the collection on the BMW Group Midrand Campus is further extended.” Process led to six artworks installed on campusThe entire process started in 2019 when the well-respected South African university “Wits” was selected by the BMW Group Art Jury as the newest member of the worldwide network of BMW Group partnerships with art schools. Ten Wits students were challenged to create art pieces presented as maquettes. The students were inspired by the BMW Group’s ethos of luxury, sustainable mobility and green solutions, and the company’s history and corporate architecture. Six maquettes were chosen by the art experts and presented to the BMW Group Art Jury for commissioning their realisation. They were installed at six locations on the campus to be seen by visitors and associates in their workspace.“The latest Art Project is a creative, innovative and unique expression of the BMW Group’s dedication to supporting local talent, sustainability and the values of the BMW Group”, said Nicole Haft-Zboril, Senior Vice President Real Estate Management. “We have a long history of including art as integral elements in our building projects and see it as a vital contribution to a modern workspace.”The following artists and works are now on view at the Midrand Campus:1. “Crumple” by Hedwig Barry Hedwig Barry, a Wits Master of Arts in Fine Arts graduate, describes the “Crumple” as a poetic reminder of the fragility of life and an interpretation of strength to preserve life – using aluminium and automotive paint. It was designed to withstand exterior weather conditions and echoes engineered crumple zones as a safety feature built into vehicles. The choice of riotous colours act as a visual signal for hope and the need for repair during what is globally a deeply uncertain time. It can be seen in the garden area alongside the N1 highway.2. “Love Letter for Lost Travellers” by Hedwig Barry“Love Letter for Lost Travellers” is the second artwork from Master of Arts in Fine Arts graduate Hedwig Barry. It creates a flowing depiction of love and loss, creating a waterfall effect using polyurethane foam and automotive paint. The work is about the interface of the personal and the public, the emotional and the intellectual; and the bodies, grounds, materials, desires and gestures that give meaning to these relationships. It spans two stories of wall and floor originating on the wall of the Welcome Centre and then nestling alongside the work of Micaela Wentzel in a clearing of the Green Lung. It culminates at an entrance to the IT building.3. “纸(ZHI)” by Tzung Hui Lauren LeeUsing paper recycled from the BMW offices and transforming them into framed works of art, the artist transfers the emotions and meaning of her subjects into her art, drawing from the vast ideas and efforts associates working within the IT building (where the artwork is situated) have created. Tzung Hui Lauren Lee takes her inspiration from her Chinese South African heritage and her experience of diaspora, and has recently completed a BA Fine Arts degree at the Wits School of Arts.4. “Mangobe Gado Gusheshe” by Themba MwanzaThemba Mwanza, a Fine Art graduate from Wits University, has created a mixed media art car located in the Midrand Campus’ Welcome Centre. He draws inspiration from his experiences on the Metrorail locomotive systems, making reference to the working class and the multi-layered community within these spaces, inspired by the many roles its individuals take on. Simultaneously, he celebrates the prolific BMW (E30) 325i, affectionately known locally as Gusheshe, by bringing these two spaces together to create this vehicular artwork.5. “Constructed Space” by Shayna RosendorffSituated in the IT building, “Constructed Space” is a series of three photographs taken of sculptures built using materials found on site. Shayna Rosendorff, who recently completed her degree in Fine Arts, was inspired by the renovations of the Midrand Campus that considered sustainability and waste consciousness, and the preservation of original structures. The work examines how nature transforms through industry, rethinking ideas of what is natural and what is manmade, and thinking through notions of representation, perception and access. 6. “The Hue Drawing” by Micaela Rose WentzelMicaela Rose Wentzel is a recent graduate in Fine Arts at Wits. She was visiting the Green Lung outside the IT building when she found the nature of the space, the sound and imagery to be lively and energetic which presents itself on different levels and taking on many forms. She set out to enhance the surrounding flora and light movements with her design, guiding viewers to notice and connect with the environment.BMW Group South Africa’s Cultural EngagementOver five decades, the BMW Group has been engaged in partnerships with some of the most renowned cultural institutions worldwide, based on mutual respect and curiosity that makes its commitment a reliable actor in the cultural field.BMW Group South Africa has supported local art collaborations with Dr. Esther Mahlangu, Nelson Makamo, Zeitz MOCAA, BMW Young Collectors Co. in partnership with FNB Art Joburg, and the Southern Guild that highlight the BMW Group’s investment in the South African art landscape.This first of its kind in South Africa, the BMW Midrand Campus Art Project follows in the footsteps of similar international Art Projects in countries including the USA, Mexico, Germany, Belgium and China. \n"}
{"prompt":"On the North Sea coast, it's not only high and low tide that create great contrasts. A ride in the exclusive edition model of the open-top four-seater takes you to ancient grain mills and ultra-modern wind turbines, past deserted marsh meadows and to popular holiday destinations. Open- top driving pleasure with lots of sand under your wheels.   ->","completion":" Munich. Hardly any region has changed as much in recent years as the western coastal section of Schleswig-Holstein. The upturn for the structurally weak area came with the subsidies for renewable energies, the conversion to organic farming and increasing numbers of tourists. Farm holidays are booming, as is the demand for organically produced food. However, the energy transition has left its most obvious traces in the northernmost federal state. The locals call the wind turbines, of which more than 3,000 have been built in Schleswig-Holstein, “energy asparaguses”. The state covers 100 per cent of its electricity needs from renewable sources, and the green energy brings additional income to the farmers on whose land the wind turbines are located. There are no wind turbines to disturb the eye of the visitor in the classic tourist areas - instead historic grain mills are a pleasing sight to look at.The vigorous wind, the pure North Sea air, winding country roads and the prospect of a sunny day at the beach make the coastal region the ideal destination for a trip in the MINI Cooper S Convertible Sidewalk In its latest edition, the open-top four-seater edition model combines its exclusive Deep Laguna metallic paintwork with the striking details of the new reduced MINI design language. The expressive tone of blue, in which the bumper strip is now also painted, and the model-specific bonnet stripes with edges in a contrasting colour set off the vehicle front with the enlarged hexagonal grille and the typical MINI round headlights in a particularly stylish way. The redesigned side scuttles are framed by a model identification featuring the “Sidewalk” inscription, and at the rear the two exhaust tailpipes are now surrounded by strikingly contoured surfaces painted in body colour. 17 inch Scissor Spoke 2-tone light-alloy wheels are also standard equipment on the edition model.The soft top in the exclusive Sidewalk design with woven arrow graphics remains closed for the time being as we speed along on motorway no. 23. Instead of the airstream, it’s the 131 kW\/178 hp 4-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology which unleashes its power. One highlight on this route is the raised bridge that crosses the Kiel Canal, which links the North sea and the Baltic Sea. More than 30,000 ships use it every year as a shortcut that runs right through Schleswig-Holstein. This makes the 98-kilometre-long canal one of the busiest man-made waterways in the world.Soon after, the motorway ends, and now the route to the coast continues along country roads. As soon as we open the top - the fully electric drive of the soft top only needs 18 seconds - fresh sea air flows into the interior of the MINI Cooper S Convertible Sidewalk. And we notice something else, too: dikes and sheep. The dikes are up to nine metres high, have a sand core and are covered with thick marsh soil. The sheep are in charge of keeping them in shape. There are about 350,000 sheep and lambs in Schleswig-Holstein - with a human population of just under 2.9 million. The sheep keep the grass short and compact the soil so that moles and mice have no chance of rooting around in it and making the dike unstable. Whereas in the past dikes were built to obtain arable land, today new dikes serve exclusively to protect the coast.The largest town on the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein is Husum. With a well-kept historical centre and cobbled streets, a picturesque market and restored gabled houses from the 16th century, the birthplace of the writer Theodor Storm (“Der Schimmelreiter” (The rider on the white horse)) exudes plenty of historical charm. One of the most popular destinations is the inland harbour with cutters, ewers, traditional sailing boats, restaurants, cafés and - as in every place on the coast - fish stalls.From Husum, narrow country roads partly lead directly along the coast to the Eiderstedt peninsula. This is where the benefits of the optional Adaptive Chassis come in. With its new damper technology, it combines hallmark MINI agility when cornering in sporty style with optimised suspension comfort, which means that even driving over cracks and potholes in the asphalt doesn’t become an ordeal. The MINI Cooper S Convertible Sidewalk is now pointed to another landmark of the west coast, the Westerheversand lighthouse, well-known from countless films, in the far west of the Eiderstedt peninsula. The red and white tower stands on a mound and is almost 42 metres high. It was built on a foundation of tree trunks and concrete to prevent it from subsiding. However, if you want to enjoy the stunning view from the tower, you not only have to register in advance, but also walk two and a half kilometres along a historic path across the salt marshes.One of the tourist hotspots on the North Sea coast is the spa town of St. Peter-Ording - It resembles something like a gigantic sandbox. Twelve kilometres of beach, up to two kilometres wide at low tide, attract hundreds of thousands of recreation-seekers and sports enthusiasts every year. Windsurfers, kitesurfers and beach surfers, who have the ideal conditions for their sport here, provide a colourful backdrop. Characteristic of St. Peter-Ording are the 13 pile dwellings that were erected on five different sections of the beach from 1911 onwards. They are only open during the season, are up to eight metres high and house a couple of restaurants in addition to the beach attendants.In the towns of Ording and Böhl, guest card holders are even allowed to drive across the beach by car from mid-March to the end of October. In the high season, these stretches of beach therefore become huge car parks. Nevertheless, there is always enough room for a spot of driving fun on sand. It's hard to imagine more beach feeling than in the open MINI Cooper S Convertible Sidewalk on the beach at St. Peter-Ording. \n"}

BMW M Motorsport and Walkenhorst Motorsport are embarking on their next major project. The team, that won the Intercontinental GT Challenge drivers’ title with Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Nick Catsburg (NED) last season, will contest the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS with two BMW M6 GT3s and top-class drivers in 2021. The endurance specialists will enter the Endurance Cup, consisting of five races on some of the most famous racetracks in Europe. The highlight of the season is the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), which Walkenhorst Motorsport won in 2018. The official test drives are scheduled to be taking place at the ‘Circuit Paul Ricard’ at Le Castellet (FRA) this week. At the wheel of the two BMW M6 GT3s this season will be BMW works drivers Timo Glock (GER), Martin Tomczyk (GER), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER). The two remaining spots will be filled by Walkenhorst Motorsport drivers David Pittard (GBR) and Thomas Neubauer (FRA). “After a successful IGTC season in 2020, we are all highly motivated to build on those successes,” said Niclas Königbauer, Walkenhorst Motorsport Team Manager. “We are in the middle of intensive preparations and will do our best to bring home fitting results for the BMW M6 GT3’s farewell season. I’m delighted with our new driver line-up, and know that with this we have laid an important foundation for achieving our goals. We will have a strong package, and as a team we are really looking forward to the challenges of the 2021 season.” After the official test drives, it is on to the crucial phase of preparations for the season opener at Monza (ITA) on 18th April. With the exception of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps and the 6 Hours of Le Castellet, each of the Endurance Cup races will last three hours. The other venues are the Nürburgring (GER) and Barcelona (ESP). As the first ever major GT race series in the world, the Fanatec GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS is heading in a totally new direction this season, by integrating sim racing into the championship as a core element. In the run-up to each of the five endurance races there will be a Fanatec Esports GT Pro Series race on the simulation platform Assetto Corsa Competizione, in which a driver nominated by each of the teams will do battle for points for the real overall standings. A maximum of 15 points in total will be awarded in the sim races, which could prove crucial in the final reckoning. Sheldon van der Linde (#34 BMW M6 GT3): “I’m very excited to be back onboard for a full endurance season with Walkenhorst Motorsport. My last race with the team at Kyalami turned out to be a massive success and one of my biggest highlights of my GT career so far. We hope to build on that this season and bring value to the team with a mix of experience and youth in our line-up. The aim for us should be to win more races and see where that takes us by the end of the year.” Marco Wittmann (#34 BMW M6 GT3): “I’m delighted to be collaborating with Walkenhorst Motorsport. The GT World Challenge Europe is a new experience for me, but my goal is to enjoy a successful season with my driver colleagues and the team – hopefully with spectators once again, as soon as the pandemic situation allows.” David Pittard (#34 BMW M6 GT3): “I’m really excited for my next challenge as I continue my development with BMW M Motorsport and Walkenhorst Motorsport in the GT World Challenge Europe in 2021. I am again provided with a great package to learn and develop my skills by working with BMW works drivers. I believe the pairing with Sheldon van der Linde and Marco Wittmann will be extremely competitive; these guys have been the fastest BMW DTM drivers in previous years and I believe we can challenge for strong positions in the championship and the Spa 24 Hours.” Timo Glock (#35 BMW M6 GT3): “I’m really looking forward to returning to endurance racing and to the joint challenge with Walkenhorst Motorsport. I’m super happy that I finally get to drive in a car with Martin Tomczyk. That’s never happened before. I’m excited to see what we can achieve together with Thomas Neubauer and the BMW M6 GT3.” Martin Tomczyk (#35 BMW M6 GT3): “The GT World Challenge Europe will be a new challenge for me as well. However, my experience of SRO race series has always been that they are highly professional. I have often said to Timo Glock that we should drive in a car as team-mates sometime – now it is finally happening. With Thomas Neubauer we have a new driver on board, and I am really looking forward to getting to know him.

{"prompt":"Germany's northernmost island is worth a visit at any time of year. There is much to discover between mudflats and waves. In-restaurants and bars as well as top-class shopping venues alternate with unspoilt nature and mile-long beaches. And in between, there are plenty of opportunities for open-air driving fun in the salty North Sea air. ->","completion":" Munich. When Hamburg residents speak quite unpretentiously of taking a trip “to the island”, it often sounds as if they’re just taking a quick drive to another part of the city. Yet Sylt lies at the very top of North Frisia and is thus still around 180 kilometres away from the Hanseatic city as the crow flies. The quickest route is via motorway 7, making it the ideal choice for a short trip with the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible , 7.4– 7.1 l\/100 km (NEDC); : 167 – 161 g\/km (WLTP), . A few kilometres beyond the city limits, the speed limit is lifted. Now the 170 kW\/231 hp four-cylinder turbo engine of the extremely sporty four-seater can really make sure that the distance between city and island actually shrinks by the minute.The fast ride ends shortly before Flensburg. From there it’s just under 50 kilometres on country roads to the \"Sylt Shuttle\" in Niebüll. The car park in front of the loading station is car-free. The MINI John Cooper Works Convertible rolls onto the motorrail train at walking pace, accompanied by the typical \"clack, clack, clack\" as it crosses the carriage lanes. Now all we can do is: Switch off the engine, apply the parking brake, open the windows and wait. And there it is, that incomparable mixture of North Sea air, salt on your lips and the crying seagulls. The motorrail train travels a short distance through small villages and over flat land, then the wagons roll onto the ten-kilometre-long Hindenburgdamm, which was inaugurated in 1927 and became the real driver of Sylt tourism. From that time on, artists such as Emil Nolde, Hermann Hesse or Stefan Zweig felt just as magically attracted to the North Sea island as intellectuals, bon vivants and actors such as Marlene Dietrich, Hans Albers or famous athletes like Max Schmeling. Thomas Mann noted in the guest book of the artists' boarding house \"Kliffende\" in Kampen in 1928: “I have lived deeply by this shattering sea.\"The crossing to Westerland station takes just under an hour. We quickly drive off the motorrail train and take a short walk to the Miramar Hotel, one of the oldest hotels on the island with a magnificent view over the Westerland spa promenade and the sea. This morning the sky is as blue as in a Nolde painting. So, on the outskirts of Westerland, it’s time to open the top. You can also do this while driving at a maximum of 30 km\/h. It takes 18 seconds. Then the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible takes off along the dead straight country road heading north. The wind blows into the interior at gale force. But our senses take in more: this intense, salty sea air, the rich, earthy aroma of the tidal flats, the herbaceous, wild scent of the dunes - and a distinctive landscape with small hills and shaggy grass that changes colour depending on the wind and light.After a good six kilometres we reach Kampen. The place is loved by some for its glamour, shunned by others because of celebrities and their exalted behaviour. An artists' colony in the pre-war period, Kampen was awakened from its slumber in the 1960s by the bon vivant and photographer Gunter Sachs. The corporate heir held wild parties on the hitherto tranquil island - and especially in Kampen. On the “whisky mile”, where luxury vehicles abound in the summer, there is a high density of those who consider themselves to be particularly important. Pretty much at the end of Kampen’s Strönwai, which is the street's real name, is the \"Pony Club\", a classy bar and celebrity disco for almost 60 years, which Gunter Sachs helped to make even more popular when he drove his classic Mini right up to the dance floor one evening. The MINI John Cooper Works Convertible doesn't put on too discreet a show either on its drive through Kampen.Its new Zesty Yellow bodypaint makes it an eye-catcher everywhere. But the open-top four-seater wears this bold colour with style. The new reduced design language draws attention to the MINI’s hallmark design features, such as the hexagonal radiator grille and the round headlights. The Union Jack design rear lights are a subtle reminder of the brand's British origins. And the powerful contours of the rear diffuser, in the centre of which the two 85-millimetre stainless steel tailpipes of the exhaust system protrude into the open air, also signal authentic sportiness. This also applies to the sound of the sports exhaust system, which underscores the spirited sprinting capability of this open-top athlete.Holidays on Sylt are very hip, the demand for accommodation continues to increase. 4.8 million tourists came in 2019. Property prices are reaching dizzying heights. Those who can afford it don't want to rent, they want to buy. Preferably one of the typical thatched houses. The consequence is that entire villages are now ghost towns that are only busy in summer and at weekends or on public holidays. In Kampen, two thirds of the houses are now holiday villas. The houses are not bought to live in, but to own. As a result, locals can no longer afford their island. Most of them now live on the mainland - as do the seasonal workers. 150,000 of them work on Sylt during the high season. Only 20,000 people are registered as residents.\n"}

The new flagship in the BMW M Motorsport portfolio of cars has been taking part in testing weeks at the Spanish racetracks of Monteblanco and Almeria since the start of the year and in doing so has rung in the crucial stage ahead of the initial race appearances. Covering more than 12,000 kilometres already – which equates to more than 60 hours on the track – numerous BMW drivers have worked extremely hard on drivability and reliability, the objective being to significantly reduce the lifecycle costs and maintenance effort compared with the predecessor model. The close collaboration between BMW M Motorsport and the series developers at BMW M GmbH, as well as making use of the BMW Group’s testing facilities, both make an important contribution to the progress of the BMW M4 GT3. The test drives at Almeria (ESP) last week represented another milestone in the development of the BMW M4 GT3, with successful endurance runs and race simulations. Martin Tomczyk, Jens Klingmann (both GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) took turns at the wheel, and these are just three of the many experienced BMW drivers who have already contributed to the optimisation of the car. Others include Augusto Farfus (BRA), Marco Wittmann (GER), Bruno Spengler (CAN), Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Jesse Krohn (FIN). In addition to endurance runs, the focus at Almeria was mainly on testing tyres of various brands. In a direct comparison with its predecessor, the BMW M6 GT3, the BMW M4 GT3 is already showing considerable improvements in crucial areas at this stage of development, namely the reduction of lifecycle costs and maintenance effort, as well as drivability for professional and amateur racing drivers, both in dry conditions and in the rain. Easy handling of the BMW M4 GT3 is the top priority – for both drivers and the team at the track. The BMW M Motorsport engineers have made a breakthrough. For the first time, it is possible to change most electronic settings in the car, without having to connect it to a laptop. Last-minute changes to control systems or sensors can be made via the multifunction steering wheel, making it much quicker and easier to make changes. “There was a really good atmosphere among us drivers during the last test drives because we were able to complete a lot of laps and we all agree that the BMW M4 GT3 is a lot of fun,” said Klingmann at the end of the week of testing at Almeria. “It is very easy and consistent to drive, which has a positive effect on tyre wear and we made progress with the development of lots of systems. Naturally, there are still lots of things to sort out, but the question marks are consistently being replaced with exclamation marks.” “Since I had only driven the car in the wet once before, the Almeria test was like a first for me,” said Tomczyk. “We were really well prepared, and everything went fantastically with very few exceptions. I also really enjoy driving the car. I’m feeling very positive.” Yelloly said: “As someone who has competed in a lot of races in the BMW M6 GT3 in recent years, I noticed right away just how big a leap forward the BMW M4 GT3 will be. We tested both performance and consistency, and practiced pit stops and performed system checks. The BMW M4 GT3 drove well on all tyre brands that we tried out so I’m very confident looking ahead to future race appearances. I can’t wait to get started.” In addition to the testing at the racetrack, which BMW Team RMG will continue intensively during the course of the year and will supplement with initial test races, the close collaboration between BMW M Motorsport and colleagues in series development in Munich (GER) plays a crucial role. BMW Group uses various test benches for the whole car as well as components, for example, to measure performance, vibrations, efficiency and roll resistance. The BMW M4 GT3 has undergone tests on the engine test bench and the roller test bench and intensive work has been done in the wind tunnel and climate tunnel. Testing also took place in the BMW Group’s acoustics tunnel this week, to advance the noise measuring tuning and silencer development with noise emissions for the BMW M4 GT3. This cutting-edge tunnel can do much more. In series operation, some of its other uses include sound development and tuning driving noises and interior noises. Testing of the BMW M4 GT3 is set to continue with further sessions in April and May.\n"}

The BMW Motorrad Race Trophy is back for 2021 – with a new scoring system and attractive prizes for the best privateer BMW riders in the world. The unique customer racing competition was launched in 2014 and enters its seventh season, after the pandemic-enforced break last year. As this year’s main prize, BMW Motorrad Motorsport will present the Race Trophy winner with a BMW M 1000 RR worth around 33,000 euros. “The close collaboration with our privateer customer racers around the world is always very important to us here at BMW Motorrad Motorsport,” said Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad. “We are proud of the big, global family of riders that we have built up consistently in recent years. Our race support provides our customers with comprehensive support when it comes to any technical questions about using their BMW racing bikes, and with on-site support at the racetrack. In addition, the Race Trophy is another important pillar in our customer racing programme. It is really important to us to honour the many successes that our privateer BMW riders celebrate around the globe, and their dedication as ambassadors of our brand. With this special competition we bring the BMW racers from a variety of race series around the world together as one big, strong community. We’re really looking forward to an exciting season and wish everyone taking part in the 2021 BMW Motorrad Race Trophy 2021 the very best of luck.” New Scoring System.The BMW Motorrad Race Trophy unites privateer BMW racers from various international and national race series in a consolidated ranking. Previously, a complex key determined the number of Race Trophy points they collected for the ranking based on their results in their respective races. To ensure that all riders were treated equally in the huge number of different race series, one of the factors was the total number of races held each season in a series. Based on this, the number of Race Trophy points up for grabs for the individual results in an individual race of a series was calculated. BMW Motorrad Motorsport has changed this scoring system for the 2021 season to increase transparency. The positioning in the overall standings of the Race Trophy is now decided based on the participants’ winning percentage in their respective race series. This is the percentage share of championship points that they attained in relation to the maximum potential score in the race series. This winning percentage will be recalculated after each race weekend and incorporated into the latest interim results of the Race Trophy. By way of example, in a championship, three races have been held up to a certain point in time X, and the maximum potential score at that time is 75. Rider XY has picked up 70 championship points in these three races, meaning his winning percentage at this point in time is 93.3 percent. This continues until the end of the season. If, for example, a rider wins all of the season’s races in their race series, they attain the maximum potential championship score and a winning percentage of 100 percent. Another example: in a race series there are ten races in a season and the maximum potential score is 250. Rider XY ends the season with 200 points to their name, which equates to 80 percent. The winning percentage only takes the championship points awarded in the actual races into account. Bonus points (for pole positions, for example) that are also awarded in some series are not taken into account. This new scoring system has several advantages, one of which is that the winning percentage can be calculated quickly and transparently after every weekend. The level playing field between the individual championships with differing numbers of races is maintained. Another considerable advantage is that it can still be used without any modifications even if the race calendars change. Attractive Prizes.There are also innovations when it comes to the prizes for the best participants in the BMW Motorrad Race Trophy. The attractive, exclusive main prize for this year’s winner is a new BMW M 1000 RR worth around 33,000 euros. The participants who finish in second to tenth place in the final classification of the Race Trophy will also be awarded prizes, receiving vouchers for BMW Motorrad parts packages, with a total value of just under 40,000 euros. The vouchers can be redeemed at BMW Motorrad Motorsport Official Partner alpha Racing. These original BMW Motorrad Performance Parts make an important contribution to the successes of BMW racing customers. All the information and data that BMW Motorrad Motorsport collates during works appearances in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) and the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) continuously flow into the development of the performance parts. Sales partner alpha Racing quickly makes these new parts available to racing customers meaning that the lifecycle from experiences in the WorldSBK, through the development of new parts, to the Performance Parts being used on the racing bikes of customer teams is very short. Registration Now Open.The 2021 BMW Motorrad Race Trophy is open to all privateer riders competing on the BMW S 1000 RR or the BMW M 1000 RR in one of the race series and championship classes classified for the Race Trophy this season (see below for an overview of the race series). For more detailed information on the 2021 BMW Motorrad Race Trophy, the regulations, an overview of the individual series and race events, as well as to register for the Race Trophy, see:www.bmw-motorrad-motorsport.com You can find a short clip that explains the new scoring system in the video section of our website www.bmw-motorrad-motorsport.com. 2021 BMW Motorrad Race Trophy – Race Series. FIM Endurance World ChampionshipFIM Endurance World CupFIM Asia Road Racing ChampionshipInternational Road Racing ChampionshipAlpe Adria International Motorcycle ChampionshipBritish Superbike ChampionshipInternational German ChampionshipFrench Superbike ChampionshipFrench European Bikes ChampionshipItalian Superbike ChampionshipItalian National Trophy 1000Spanish Superbike ChampionshipCanadian Superbike ChampionshipMotoAmerica AMA Road Racing SeriesSuperBike BrasilAll Japan Road Race ChampionshipAustralian Superbike Championship Note to Editors.In our BMW Motorrad Motorsport newsletter, we report regularly on the latest successes of our BMW customer racing teams and Race Trophy participants.

In addition to the one-make cups within the DTM and the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS), which had already been announced, the car will also compete in the hands of private teams and drivers in one-make cups in the Benelux countries and Italy in 2021. Newly on board is RECARO Automotive as ‘Technical Partner of BMW M Motorsport M2 CS Racing’. The new BMW M2 CS Racing is already very popular, even ahead of its first complete racing season, proof being the four one-make cups in Europe in which the car will start in 2021. The BMW M2 Cup, which will hold its races within the DTM in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, and the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup NLS on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), that will start into the season next Saturday, were announced some time ago. They are now joined by BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux and the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Italy. In both of these one-make cups and the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup NLS, the teams will have a choice of various performance levels for the BMW M2 CS Racing for the first time. As well as the variant with the 365-hp six-cylinder inline engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology, there is also a 450-hp version for more ambitious drivers. As the new ‘Technical Partner of BMW M Motorsport M2 CS Racing’, RECARO Automotive is supplying the race seats for this more powerful car, which is used in the one-make cups. “The way the BMW M2 CS Racing has been received by teams and drivers is really impressive and shows that we have really hit the spot with the development of our new entry-level motorsport model,” says Thomas Felbermair, Vice President Sales and Marketing BMW M GmbH. “As well as the BMW M2 Cup in the DTM and the three one-make cups in Benelux, Italy and within the Nürburgring Endurance Series, the car will also compete in many other race series around the world.

Perfectly networked, always online, seamlessly integrated and always ready for typical MINI driving pleasure. This is how urban premium mobility presents itself in the digital age. Alongside the fresh, strikingly purist design and new equipment features, the extensively enhanced operating system with its additional digital services is a major highlight of the new editions of the MINI 3-door, MINI 5-door and MINI Convertible. Now more than ever, the unmistakable MINI feeling can be seamlessly integrated into the digital lifestyle.The refined premium ambience in the interior of the MINI 3-door, MINI 5-door and MIN Convertible also includes a redesigned centre instrument. An 8.8-inch touch display in black panel design is now standard. The control units for the audio system and the touch-sensitive favourite buttons are integrated flush into the high-quality Piano Black high-gloss surface. The light signal of the LED decor ring surrounding the centre instrument can correspond to the operation of the air conditioning, among other things. If the heat output is increased, the display moves to the red area; if the desired temperature is reduced, the display again moves to the blue area. In conjunction with the Ambient Light option, the LED decor ring features a distinctive laser engraving.The current advances in the field of digitalisation are also symbolised by the multifunctional instrument display on the steering column, which is part of the Connected Media option. The 5.0-inch colour display, which also uses black panel technology, shows all relevant driving information. In the MINI Cooper SE it also serves as a display for the charging status while connected to the power supply.The latest generation of the operating system in the MINI 3-door, MINI 5-door and MINI Convertible ensures that driving pleasure is accompanied by a completely new user experience. Menu selection on the touch display of the centre instrument becomes even more intuitive with a significantly modernised layout. For the first time, Live Widgets are available for this purpose, which can be selected by a swipe. The desired function is then enlarged in the centre of the display. This means that operation in the MINI is even more closely aligned with the user behaviour familiar from smartphones and other digital devices. The content of the Live Widgets and the order in which they are arranged can be configured individually.The standard configuration shows one widget each for the menu items Media, Communication, Navigation, Vehicle Settings, the MINI Connected Apps and Messages. Depending on the function, the current status - for example, the route currently being taken on the navigation map or the last audio programme selected - is always displayed on the corresponding graphic.In addition, the driver can now, for the first time, adapt the colour world of the displays on the centre - and the multifunctional instrument to his or her driving style and individual mood. Two modes are available for the graphic displays. In \"Lounge\" mode, a relaxing colour world between turquoise and petrol is called up. Switching to the \"Sport\" mode makes the screen backgrounds glow in red and anthracite. If desired, the colour worlds for the displays become part of an overall staged driving experience.In conjunction with the MINI Driving Modes, they are linked to the respective vehicle setting. For example, switching to the \"SPORT\" driving mode immediately activates the matching colour world on the displays. In vehicles equipped with the Ambient Light option, the colour worlds of the display can also be combined with the control of the interior lighting. There is then a choice of six interior light colours for each of the \"Lounge\" and \"Sport\" modes.In the MINI Cooper SE, the eDrive display on the centre instrument provides information about the current energy flow, the range and options for increasing it, for example by switching to GREEN mode. The Range Assistant of the navigation system checks whether the selected destination can be reached with the available energy capacities and suggests public charging stations along the route. In addition, charging stations are also listed under the so-called Points of Interest, including information about the available connections, the operator and the payment modalities. With the Green Driving Assistant, the navigation system calculates the most efficient route to the destination. This also takes into account the individual driving style and the Real Time Traffic Information.The use of third-party apps in the vehicle has also been further optimised. One of the most important innovations is the integration of the voice assistant Amazon Alexa. In the MINI 3-door, MINI 5-door and MINI Convertible, the voice assistant's capabilities can now be fully utilised - whether for selecting music tracks, creating a shopping list or controlling smart home functions. For all that, just a connection between the personal Amazon Alexa account and the MINI App is required. The integration of the digital service Amazon Alexa for the MINI is available for smartphones with the iOS or Android operating systems.In its latest version, the MINI App offers a particularly wide range of options for combining the fun of driving the MINI and the digitally designed areas of everyday life even more closely. In addition, the user-friendliness, safety and reliability of the MINI App have been further optimised. It acts as a universal interface to the vehicle. This means, for example, that information on the vehicle status can be called up on the smartphone and remote services such as locking and unlocking the doors can be activated.The MINI App can also be used to optimise charging processes and remotely control the climate control of the MINI Cooper SE. The interior can be pre-conditioned during the charging process so that the journey can begin in a pleasantly cooled or heated vehicle. Information on the charging status, charging history and current range is displayed on the smartphone, as are public charging stations in the vicinity. In addition, the MINI App enables direct contact with the MINI Service Partner. The MINI Breakdown Service and the MINI Online Shop can also be conveniently accessed. By mid-2021, the MINI App will be available in more than 40 countries and in 23 languages.\n"}

John Edwards (USA), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Augusto Farfus (BRA) completed the podium with third place in the #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE. The classic race in the US state of Florida was the second major endurance event of the season in North America. Starting drivers De Phillippi and Krohn each moved up one place after beginning the race from third and fourth positions. That was followed by twelve eventful hours of racing on the Sebring International Raceway, with numerous full course yellows. The #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE led the GTLM class for a time before falling back a little to second place in the final stages. The #24 car was also in a promising position before slipping down a lap due to a minor pit stop fire around two hours before the finish and then returning to the track in fourth place. The closing stage proved to be full of drama. During the battle for the lead, De Phillippi made contact with the leading GTLM car eight minutes before the end and received a drive-through penalty. Despite that he was able to hold on to second place in the class with the #25 car. Krohn moved up from fourth to third place on the final lap in the #24 car. In the GTD class, the Turner Motorsport #96 BMW M6 GT3 secured eighth place. Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley (both USA) and Aidan Read (AUS) shared driving duties. The trio had lost a substantial amount of time during repairs in the early stage of the race and worked their way back up as the race progressed. The IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge race took place on Friday. After two hours of racing, Auberlen and Dillon Machavern (USA) finished third in the Turner Motorsport #95 BMW M4 GT4 to secure a spot on the podium. The duo of Greg Liefooghe and Sean Quinlan (both USA) finished fifth in the #43 BMW M4 GT4 of Stephen Cameron Racing. Robby Foley and Vincent Barletta (both USA) secured seventh place in the #96 BMW M4 GT4 from Turner Motorsport. The third endurance race of the season for BMW Team RLL, the 6-hour race at Watkins Glen (USA), is scheduled for 27th June. Quotes after the Twelve Hours of Sebring: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “The guys did a great job. It was unfortunate for the #24 and we still don’t know what exactly happened at the pit stop with the fire but thankfully nobody got hurt and we were able to get going again. The final minutes were unlucky. When you have the chance to win the Twelve Hours of Sebring you’ve got to go for it. It didn’t quite work out but you can’t blame anybody; everybody was aggressive at the end. It was a shame but we gave our best shot and today it looked pretty good for a while. We got a good gap to the Corvette and the Porsche but then the yellows came out and that made it a whole new race again towards the end. We would have liked to win this race, especially this race, but with P2 and P3 we are now looking forward to the next one at Watkins Glen.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 2nd place GTLM class): “I think we can be really proud of our performance today. We knew we had to maximise literally everything into this car and this is exactly what we did. We put ourselves in the position to fight at the end. I could taste the win, tried to battle with the leader. I saw an opportunity and went for it but it didn’t work. We still came home second and third for BMW. It’s great to be on the podium. It was nice to come back here and show that we have the speed. It’s a good result and good points for BMW and now we will try to get the win at the six-hour race.” Bruno Spengler (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 2nd place GTLM class): “What a race. We were competing for the lead pretty much the whole race. At times, it was really intense and felt like a sprint race. After the restarts, behind each other and chasing each other, it was a lot of fun. We fought until the end and Connor saw a gap and went for it. Unfortunately there was a contact and for sure it was not intentional from his side, he just tried to go for the win but we still finished in P2. It’s a great result for us, for the whole team. The team has been working awesomely hard to give us such a good car here at Sebring so we can be happy about this great result.” Philipp Eng (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 2nd place GTLM class): “I am obviously very happy about the podium. It is such a fantastic race and such a fantastic racetrack. In the end I think Connor just relied on his instinct. The outcome is what it is but I would not have done it any differently. Unfortunately we missed out on the win but it is still a double podium for BMW.” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd place GTLM class): “It was really bad luck. Two years in a row, we fell out of the battle at the end. Unfortunately, the yellow came too late so we were stuck driving one lap behind the other guys. There is not much you can do. Unfortunately some things then happened at the front and we came out with P3 but it wasn’t really what we were looking for and what we could have done.” John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd place GTLM class): “My sister sent me a text and it said ‘you really rose from the ashes’ and I think that is really true tonight. A surprising podium on the last lap as the Corvette was having problems. So we take it and take the points. But overall it was a disappointing day as we were very competitive. Together with the other car, we were running in P1 and P2 with a couple of hours to go and it looked like we could have a shot for both cars to stay there. We then had the fire but most importantly everyone is okay.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd place GTLM class): “It’s a shame that we had the fire. Looking at how the race ended I think we would have been right there and we would have been able to go for the victory, but besides that I think it’s a shame what happened to Connor. We all had a very good race, trouble free apart from the incident in the pit lane in which luckily no one got hurt. Another podium, so I think there is a reason to celebrate.” \n"}
{"prompt":"The BMW iX heralds a new age in mobility. It combines trailblazing design and modern luxury with the latest innovations in automated driving, operation, connectivity and digital services. The BMW Group’s new technology flagship focuses on both locally emission-free driving pleasure – combined with the brand’s hallmark sporting ability, efficiency and convincing operating range – and an unwavering, integrated approach to sustainability applied from the ground up. ->","completion":" The most exacting environmental compatibility requirements have been put in place throughout the value chain and for the full life cycle of the BMW iX. The car is currently in the final phase of its series development. At market launch – which will get underway at the end of 2021 – customers will be able to choose from two model variants: the BMW iX xDrive50 and BMW iX xDrive40.The BMW iX redefines the successful Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) concept. It is the first model based on a new, modular, scalable toolkit on which the future of the BMW Group will be built. The development and production of the BMW iX follow an all-encompassing approach to sustainability involving compliance with strict environmental and social standards in the extraction of raw materials, plus the use of electricity from renewable sources and a high proportion of recycled materials in the mix.“Technology is driving the advances we need to tackle even the greatest challenges. This applies in particular to climate protection,” says Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “We are in no doubt: mobility has to be sustainable if it is to represent a truly outstanding solution. For the BMW Group, premium mobility is not possible without responsibility.”“We made a promise and we will deliver on that promise: the market launch of the BMW iX will get underway at the end of this year with a two-pronged approach – in the form of the BMW iX xDrive40 and BMW iX xDrive50,” says Pieter Nota, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. “We have already set out the pricing for Germany. For example, the BMW iX xDrive40 will start at 77,300 EUR, which puts it at the level of a comparable BMW X5 with conventional combustion engine. Plus, our customers will now benefit from new additions to the range of vehicle functions that can be uploaded to their cars during ownership, and enjoy a seamless and extremely customer-oriented configuration process with personalised products and services.”Monitored raw materials production, across-the-board green power for manufacturing, high proportion of natural and recycled materials.The BMW Group procures the cobalt and lithium required for the high-voltage batteries from controlled sources in Australia and Morocco, before supplying them to the battery cell manufacturers. As in the production of the overall vehicle at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, the battery cells are manufactured using exclusively green power from certified sources. And since February 2021 the company has bought in aluminium manufactured using electricity from solar energy plants. The importance placed on conserving resources in the production of the BMW iX is highlighted by the high proportion of secondary aluminium and recycled plastic used. The car’s interior features FSC-certified wood, leather tanned with olive leaf extracts and other natural materials. Among the raw materials used for the floor coverings and mats are recovered fishing nets.“Rather than simply passing responsibility on to the supplier network, we take responsibility together with our direct suppliers,” explains Dr Andreas Wendt, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network. “In so doing, we tap into our many years of experience and create processes for attaining greater transparency and traceability.”Electric motors: enhancing dynamism, reducing the use of critical materials.Added to which, the electric motors for the BMW iX are marked out by a design which enables the use of rare earths to be avoided. They work according to the principle of a current-excited synchronous motor. The excitation of the rotor in the BMW iX motors is not induced by fixed permanent magnets, but the feed-in of electric energy. This removes the need for the critical materials used to manufacture magnets, and the BMW Group is therefore not reliant on their availability.This special design also has a positive effect on the motors’ performance characteristics. The precisely controlled excitation of the rotor using electric power enables peak torque to be on tap in full immediately on pulling away. And – unlike with electric motors of conventional design – that torque is maintained over an extremely broad rev band. The defining trait of the driving experience on board the BMW iX is, then, power development that is not only lightning fast but also unusually consistent, underscoring the car’s brand-typical sporting excellence.In the BMW iX xDrive50, the drive system – which features one electric motor on the front axle and another at the rear axle – produces total output of over 370 kW\/500 hp and enables acceleration of 0 to 100 km\/h of range. In both model variants, the high-voltage battery’s charge can be increased from 10 to 80 per cent of its full capacity in under 40 minutes.New technology toolkit underpins further advances towards automated driving.The new technology toolkit making its debut in the BMW iX also provides the platform for significant progress in the areas of automated driving and digital services. For example, the level of computing power has been developed to process 20 times the data volume of previous models. As a result, around double the amount of data from vehicle sensors can be processed than was previously possible.“We are setting new industry standards with the technology in the BMW iX. The iX has more computing power for data processing and more powerful sensor technology than the newest vehicles in our current line-up, is 5G-capable, will be given new and improved automated driving and parking functions and uses the high-performing fifth generation of our electric drive system,” says Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development.Fresh design for a new driving experience.The BMW iX is leading the way for a future generation of cars with which the company is redefining sustainability, driving pleasure and what it means to be premium. This trailblazing character is clearly expressed in the car’s design, which has been developed from the inside out. The BMW iX has therefore been created to provide quality of life and wellbeing for drivers and passengers.The clear and minimalist design of its exterior showcases a new form of mobility geared squarely to the needs of the vehicle’s occupants. Its interior offers those on board innovative options for using the time during a journey – and enjoying relaxation, safety, security, and a new form of luxury in the process.“The BMW iX shows how we can give new technologies a very modern and emotional design. The car is technologically complex, but it feels very clear and uncomplicated,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design. “The BMW iX offers a mobile living space in which people will feel at ease, where the car’s intelligence is only there when you need it.” Please find here the press kit of the design world premiere of the first ever BMW iX:https:\/\/pressclub.bmwgroup.net\/global\/article\/detail\/T0319728EN\/the-first-ever-bmw-ix-%E2%80%93-design-world-premiere\n"}

Eight-part video clip series on MINI's social media channels celebrates the enthusiasm for diversity, the openness to new things and the creativity that inspires people in different ways. ->","completion":" Munich. Under the motto \"Launched by _ \", the British premium car manufacturer MINI is launching a global video clip campaign for the market launch of the new edition of its models in the small car segment. Young and renowned artists, up-coming athletes and experienced driving fun experts, as well as influencers and thought leaders from various disciplines, each show in their own individual way how they help the extensively revised MINI 3-door, MINI 5-door and MINI Convertible models make a grand entrance in their personal environment. The eight-part short film series focuses on the enthusiasm for diversity, the openness to new things and the creativity that inspires people all over the world in the most diverse forms.Pioneering achievements, new ideas and the courage to find unconventional solutions are deeply rooted in the tradition of the MINI brand. \"Even Alec Issigonis, the creator of the classic Mini, was a creative mastermind who recorded his first sketches for a revolutionary new small car on a napkin,\" says Sebastian Beuchel, Head of MINI Global Brand Management. \"This attitude continues to shape us today. In our 'Launched by _ ' campaign, we therefore show people who dare to try something new and inspire with their ideas - each in their own unique way.\" With \"Launched by _ \", MINI is once again offering a platform on which creative people from different directions can present their individual view of MINI. This also expresses the conviction that it is good for the brand not to determine every detail itself, but to gain new impulses through co-creation and collaboration.The protagonists for the \"Launched by _ \" clips range from world-famous British fashion designer Sir Paul Smith to US professional skateboarder Briana King and from Charlie Cooper, the grandson of legendary sports car designer John Cooper, to the digital influencer Miquela, who now has already more than three million fans on Instagram. They were all confronted with the same question: \"How would you launch a MINI?The answers were as varied as life in the global markets where MINI is successful. British photographer and director Rankin portrayed people who have a personal connection to the British brand for his personal staging of the MINI 5-door. Jonathan Jay Lee, illustrator from Hong Kong, made the MINI 3-door the main character of a fast-paced comic strip. The contribution of Turkish cake artist Tuba Geçkil was an epicurean delight. In her Red Rose Cake studio in Istanbul, she created a literally sweet version of the MINI Convertible. The British pop artist Lakwena also dedicated herself to the MINI Convertible. Inspired by the new Zesty Yellow body paint, she created a mural in London in bright colours and with a clear message: #BIGLOVE.The campaign for the market launch of the new edition of the MINI 3-door, the MINI 5-door and the MINI Convertible models is thus also a reflection of the character of the worldwide MINI Community, in which the joy of individuality and the emotional experience in a strong community ideally complement each other. \"MINI stands for diversity, joie de vivre and unity. The personalities and their stories in our campaign 'Launched by _ ' are as diverse as the driving pleasure with our new models,\" explains Sebastian Beuchel. \"This shows the meaning of the statement 'We are all different - but pretty good together'. Diversity - in all its forms - is an important stimulus for ideas and innovations.The market launch campaign \"Launched by _ \" comprises a pre-roll spot as well as eight editorial stories of up to one minute in length for use on MINI's international digital channels and platforms. For the first time, MINI is also using the popular social video app TikTok as a communication platform. \"With TikTok we are opening up another fast-growing social media channel for MINI brand messages, on which we want to inspire a young, digitally affine target group,\" says Sebastian Beuchel. \n"}
{"prompt":"An excursion to the old Hanseatic city and the Baltic Sea coast allows you to discover historical sites, locations of world literature and great beach life. The most beautiful route leads along winding country roads, which were once important trade routes and today provide above all driving pleasure.  ->","completion":" Munich. If Hamburgers are drawn to the Baltic Sea beach, they can first follow the signs to Berlin. The Autobahn 24 not only leads to the capital, but also forms the first stage for a particularly scenic route to Lübeck and from there on to the sea. After about 40 kilometres of driving through eastern Schleswig-Holstein, it's time to switch from the modern-day expressway to the old salt road, especially behind the wheel of the MINI Cooper S 5-door , which can show off its brand-typical agility much better on winding country roads. The historic trade route north is therefore the ideal terrain for driving pleasure on the way to the coast.The cockpit display and central instrument light up in \"Sport\" colour mode, the newly designed sports leather steering wheel fits perfectly in the hand, and the four-cylinder turbo engine with 131 kW\/178 hp responds spontaneously to every movement of the accelerator. So it's a brisk drive past green meadows and lush fields through the sparsely populated countryside to Mölln, a small town in the district of Herzogtum Lauenburg, surrounded by lakes and known as the home of Till Eulenspiegel. The literary figure goes back to a roving prankster who allegedly teased his fellow men with all kinds of pranks in the 14th century.The second stop on the tour is also surrounded by lakes. Ratzeburg is also known as the island city. A few hundred steps, in any direction, are all it takes for visitors to reach the water's edge. The Ratzeburg Cathedral is well worth seeing and is one of northern Germany's oldest Romanesque brick buildings. Right next door, in a baroque manor house, the dukes of Mecklenburg once resided. The town is known to sports fans for the Ratzeburger Achter. At the local rowing club, coaching legend Karl Adam laid the foundation for the German Eight, the flagship of the German Rowing Association, which has repeatedly achieved great success at the Olympic Games and World Championships since the 1960s.The route continues along the lakeshore towards Lübeck. On the drive through Grönauer Heide, you can also enjoy the benefits of the new adaptive suspension in the MINI Cooper S 5-door. Frequency-selective damping now ensures an optimised balance between sportiness and ride comfort. The go-kart feeling typical of the brand can be felt in every bend. At the same time, an additional valve ensures extremely fast adjustment of the damping forces so that the harmonious driving characteristics are not disturbed even by bumps in the road surface.After a good 20 kilometres, the Hanseatic city of Lübeck is reached. The first thing you see is the Holsten Gate. The city's landmark is quite crooked. But it's still worth going in, because it will probably remain crooked for another 700 years. When visiting the \"Queen of the Hanseatic League\", as Lübeck is also called, the question automatically arises: what to see first? The old town with its narrow alleys? The corridors with the small outbuildings behind the merchants' houses? The magnificent churches? Lübeck is part of the Unesco World Cultural Heritage and accordingly has a lot to offer.The ideal starting point for exploring the two-square-kilometre old town island is the market at the town hall. The people of Lübeck spent 300 years building it, ultimately combining several stylistic epochs from the Gothic to the Renaissance. Right next door is St. Mary's Cathedral with its almost 40-metre-high vault, which is still a small miracle for structural engineers. After so much high culture, the sugar level can plummet. A visit to the marzipan shop Niederegger, a specialist in this sweet delicacy, will help. Here you can discover marzipan in every conceivable variation. imaginable. As a strong bar, as a confection and also as ice cream. And let's not forget the nut and cream cake with a marzipan topping, for which gourmets will travel many a long way. If you have already decided on a large number of souvenirs: There's plenty of room in the luggage compartment of the MINI Cooper S 5-door. It holds 278 litres when all five seats are in use, and can otherwise be expanded to up to 941 litres.Literary pleasure is just a few steps away. \"My childhood was cherished and happy. I grew up with four brothers and sisters in an elegant town house that my father had built for himself and his family, and enjoyed a second home in the old family house from the 18th century, with the motto 'Dominus providebit' on the rococo gable, which my paternal grandmother lived in alone and which today, as the 'Buddenbrook House', is an object of curiosity for foreigners.\" This is how Thomas Mann describes his grandparents' house, the literary model for the novel Buddenbrooks, published in 1901. Much of the story takes place in a \"house in Mengstraße\", which bears great similarities to the house at Mengstraße 4 in Lübeck. Thomas Mann based his novel on historical reality, but transformed it into poetry. After a chequered history, the Buddenbrookhaus now houses the Heinrich and Thomas Mann Centre, a memorial and research centre in honour of the two writer brothers.Lübeck is also home to the traces of a second Nobel Prize winner in literature. Günter Grass lived near the city from 1986 until his death in 2015 and maintained his office, secretariat and archive in Lübeck's Glockengießerstraße. The Günter Grass House is dedicated to the literary, pictorial and sculptural work of the writer.And finally, another Nobel Prize winner is a son of the city of Lübeck. The Willy Brandt House is a museum and memorial to the Lübeck-born SPD politician, German Chancellor and Nobel Peace Prize winner. The exhibition covers periods in Willy Brandt's life - from his childhood and youth in Lübeck to his flight in a cutter and exile to his time as governing mayor in Berlin and his commitment to peace, freedom and the enforcement of human rights.The last stop on the tour is the Lübeck district of Travemünde. Just 20 kilometres from the gates of the Hanseatic city lies the seaside resort, whose history goes back to 1800 and which had its heyday during the Belle Epoque. In some places, the breath of history can still be felt - or is it just a light breeze from the Baltic Sea? The old Kurhaus now houses a wellness hotel, and the casino once known throughout Europe is now a luxury hotel.New splendour and lively life are developing on the Priwall peninsula. The tip of the peninsula belongs partly to Travemünde and partly to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. For a few years now, the area has been completely turned inside out. A new holiday area is being built directly on the Trave River, where the four-masted barque \"Passat\" is moored. Apartment buildings, marinas, boutiques, cafés and restaurants form the new face of the peninsula, which also has quiet corners with the nature reserve at the Pötenitzer Wiek and some beautiful beaches. And when one of the big Scandinavian ferries sails from the Trave into the Baltic Sea, you can still feel something of the big wide world. \n"}

A first jury nominates the artists Lamin Fofana, Calla Henkel & Max Pitegoff, Sandra Mujinga and Sung Tieu for the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2021. The nominees will show their artworks in a joint exhibition at Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin from September 16, 2021 to February 27, 2022. In cooperation with BMW as long-term partner the Preis der Nationalgalerie will be awarded for the eleventh time this fall by the Nationalgalerie Berlin.The international jury, consisting of Adam Budak (Artistic Director, Kestner Gesellschaft, Hannover), Dr Andrea Lissoni (Artistic Director, Haus der Kunst, Munich), Dr Zoé Whitley (Director, Chisenhale Gallery, London), and Franciska Zólyom (Director, Curator, Galerie für Zeitgenössische Kunst Leipzig), noted about their unanimous selection:“Lamin Fofana’s (lives in Berlin) experience of moving between Africa, North America, and Europe is palpable in his experimental approach to creating sonic environments. Crucial in the context of this production is an engagement with historical forms of Black activism and critical thought, including the writing of Amiri Baraka, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Sylvia Wynter. Yet his work expands beyond the act of translation to create a space for shared experience and heightened awareness. In doing so, he proposes an active and open practice of listening, a skill which represents an essential precondition for coexistence.Over the course of the past ten years, the work of Calla Henkel and Max Pitegoff (born 1988 in Minneapolis, USA\/born 1987 in Buffalo, USA; both live in Berlin) has been both a documentation of and a catalyst for socio-urban changes within the context of Berlin and beyond. Against this backdrop, their practice, which has developed out of the tradition of documentary photography to encompass the nurturing of their own creative community, feels timely. Emerging from lived experience, their works pose crucial questions about what is to be shown and what is to be safeguarded, allowing a multitude of narratives to unfold around a shared setting.Operating with a freshness and energy, Sandra Mujinga (born 1989 in Goma, DR Congo, lives in Berlin and Oslo, Norway) finds images and spatial arrangements for transient worlds, which extend beyond an anthropocentric paradigm. Her engagement with a notion of place, both as exhibition space and as a wider social category, offers a commentary on settings and locations, particularly those that consider themselves liberal. By not only navigating a condition of inbetweenness, but also by reconfiguring it and sharing it with others in a variety of media, she questions established principles of presence and sculpture.By using a variety of artistic media including installation, sound, text, video and public interventions, Sung Tieu (born 1987 in Hai Duong, Vietnam, lives in Berlin) creates formally minimalistic and impressive environments that trigger immediate sensual and somatic experience. Starting out from an interest in psychoacoustics, her works depict how sound can be used as an invasive tool in order to manipulate individual and collective behavior, beliefs, and desires. Informed by the conflicting mechanisms of care and control, and the unstable spatial and social relations that impact on life in diaspora, she investigates the diffusion of information and the movement of people, goods, and commodities in a compelling manner.”Dr Gabriele Knapstein, Head of the Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin: “The Preis der Nationalgalerie has been awarded since 2000, and we are delighted that we can continue, in cooperation with the Freunde der Nationalgalerie and our partner BMW, to present the work of outstanding young artists to a wide audience. We would like to thank the members of the first jury for their enthusiastic discussions and an exciting decision. Once more, it is apparent just how international the contemporary art scene in Germany is.”“During times of rapid change, responsibility and reliability are of the greatest value. As is culture. In 2021 we celebrate 50 years of our worldwide cultural engagement and we are proud to have been a partner of the Preis der Nationalgalerie for fifteen years now. This year this prestigious award gives a stage to exciting young positions of contemporary art who celebrate crossover and collaboration,” says Dr Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Finance.Together with a video statement the shortlist was first published exclusively by ArtReview and Monopol.A second jury will choose the awardee of the Preis der Nationalgalerie on October 7, 2021 with a price ceremony at the same evening. The award consists of a solo exhibition accompanied by a catalogue at one of the institutions of Berlin’s Nationalgalerie in fall 2022.The Preis der Nationalgalerie is enabled by the Freunde der Nationalgalerie e.V. since 2000 with BMW as exclusive partner for 15 years. The award focuses on young important positions of today. Artists of all nationalities are eligible if they are currently working in Germany and are less than 40 years old.

{"prompt":"With fresh design accents and the expressive Zesty Yellow body colour, the new edition of the open-top four-seater now brings even more typical MINI style to the premium small car segment. New trims and equipment packages allow for particularly targeted individualisation.   ->","completion":" Munich. Spring will not be long in coming. A particularly attractive harbinger of the warm season is already on the roads these days. With the market launch of the new MINI Convertible, the brand-typical driving pleasure and extroverted style in a small car reach an even higher level. The open four-seater of the British premium brand now underlines its unmistakable charisma with a clear and reduced design. The fresh accents on the exterior are expressed particularly intensively in conjunction with the exterior paint in the new Zesty Yellow variant available exclusively for the MINI Convertible.The powerful bright yellow colour emphasises the lively appearance of the MINI Convertible. At the front of the vehicle, it also adorns the bumper strip, which serves as the number plate holder and is now no longer painted in black but always in the same colour as the car. The minimalist design language also brings the design features characteristic of the brand even more into focus. The hexagonal radiator grille has gained in size and presence, while black inner housings now make the round headlights look even more expressive. With LED units as standard, they provide bright and even illumination of the road. Vertical air inlets for the air curtains have replaced the fog lights.Precise modifications to the side view include wheel arch surrounds with new contours. In addition, the side indicators integrated into the redesigned side scuttles are now also LED. At the rear, the clear surface design and the now standard LED lights in the distinctive Union Jack design catch the eye.The MINI Convertible combines the enthusiasm for open-top driving pleasure with clever functionality. It’s fully electrically driven, and thus particularly quiet textile soft top can be opened and closed within 18 seconds at a time. The soft top can also be activated while driving at speeds of up to 30 km\/h. For a precisely dosed supply of fresh air and sunlight, the front section of the soft top can be continuously retracted by up to 40 centimetres. This sunroof function is available at any speed. As an alternative to the black version, a MINI Yours soft top is also available, which refers to the British homeland of the MINI brand with a woven-in Union Jack pattern in titanium grey. The dynamic arrow graphic on the soft top of the MINI Convertible in the Sidewalk Edition is just as striking.The brand's typical open-air pleasure appeals to a steadily growing fan base around the world. By far the most important sales market for the MINI Convertible is Germany, followed by the USA and Great Britain, and far ahead of France, Spain and Portugal, which are known for their reliably warm summers and many hours of sunshine. Last year, German MINI fans opted for a MINI Convertible in almost every fifth purchase.For the latest generation of the MINI Convertible, there is a choice of three engine variants with a power range between 75 kW\/102 hp and 131 kW\/178 hp. The petrol engines with three or four cylinders feature modern MINI TwinPower Turbo technology and comply with the Euro 6d emissions standard. The model range also includes the extremely sporty MINI John Cooper Works Convertible With it, the wind can easily reach gale force. Its 170 kW\/231 hp four-cylinder turbo engine enables acceleration from zero to 100 km\/h in 6.6 seconds. In combination with the optional 8-speed Steptronic transmission, the sprint to 100 km\/h is even completed in 6.5 seconds.The MINI Convertible is not only the original in its vehicle class, but also the only open-top model in the premium small car segment that is truly unique. Its exclusive character can be emphasised even more with new design and equipment features. In addition to the Zesty Yellow exterior paint, there is a choice of two new body paint variants, Rooftop Grey metallic and Island Blue metallic. The range of light-alloy wheels includes no fewer than five new variants. These include the 17-inch light-alloy wheels in Scissor Spoke design, previously only available for the MINI Convertible Sidewalk, and the 18-inch light-alloy wheels in Pulse Spoke design with concentric bi-colour look.The new trims and equipment packages offer further opportunities for individualisation. With their harmoniously coordinated design features, Classic Trim, MINI Yours Trim and John Cooper Works Trim each clearly highlight the different facets of the MINI Convertible's character. Similarly, the newly compiled equipment packages allow individual wishes in the areas of comfort, driver assistance and connectivity to be fulfilled in a particularly targeted manner. \n"}

Preparations are underway for the 2021 season in the MotoGP World Championship, which begins on 28th March with the Grand Prix of Qatar in Losail. BMW M has been the ‘Official Car of MotoGP’ since 1999, an involvement that includes the provision of the safety car fleet. This year marks the first time that BMW M GmbH is presenting three new safety cars and a new safety bike. In Qatar, the BMW M3, the BMW M4 and the BMW M5 CS Safety Cars will be celebrating their debuts. They will be joined by the new BMW M 1000 RR Safety Bike. The BMW M 1000 RR is the first M model from BMW Motorrad and the racing version will be appearing in the Superbike World Championship. The 2021 safety car fleet will be completed at the first European race of the season, the Grande Prémio de Portugal on 18th April in Portimão. The BMW M8 Competition Coupe Safety Car, the BMW M8 Competition Gran Coupe Safety Car, the BMW X5 M Medical Car and another BMW M 1000 RR Safety Bike will be in action from then on. “The safety car fleet is the focal point of our involvement in the MotoGP and we are very proud to be starting the season with four new vehicles for the first time in our 20-year history as ‘Official Car of MotoGP’,” said Markus Flasch, CEO BMW M GmbH. “Our three new safety cars are based on production models, which deliver outstanding performance and driving dynamics that make them ideally suited to appear in the MotoGP. They will be joined by the new BMW M 1000 RR as the safety bike. The first M model on two wheels has been developed in motorsport and will meet the most exacting requirements on the racetrack. We are looking forward to the season-opener in Qatar and seeing our new fleet in action.” Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP rights holder Dorna Sports, added: “With this new safety car fleet, our partner BMW M once again demonstrates their level of commitment and passion for the MotoGP. In 2021, we will be embarking on our 23rd season together and the presentation of the fleet with three new safety cars and the new safety bike is a real statement. It shows the strength and seriousness of our partnership and we are very grateful to BMW M GmbH for this involvement.” The production versions of the new safety cars have already been designed for sporty performance and perfect driving behaviour up to the limits. Therefore, only a few adjustments were required to allow their use as safety cars in MotoGP. These modifications include light bars, flashing front lights, motorsport quick-release bonnet latches and emergency power shutoffs for overseas transport. The rear seat has also been removed from the BMW M4 Competition Coupe Safety Car and a rollbar and 4-point sports harness have been installed. The BMW M3 and BMW M4 Safety Cars have modified exhaust systems. BMW M is taking a new approach to colours with the safety cars this year. Instead of appearing in classic motorsport white, the safety vehicles will be sporting exclusive colours from M production models: the BMW M3 Competition Sedan Safety Car in Frozen Grey Dark Metallic, the BMW M4 Competition Coupe Safety Car in São Paulo Yellow and the BMW M5 CS Safety Car in Frozen Deep Green Metallic. When designing the livery, BMW M has again chosen to stay with a classic, purist safety car look. It emphasises the basic colours of the vehicles, simultaneously underlining the typical appearance of a safety car. The new BMW M 1000 RR Safety Bike is white with the well-known M colours, bearing the livery that the BMW M 1000 RR will also be using in the Superbike World Championship. For more information about BMW M GmbH and the involvement as the ‘Official Car of MotoGP’, see: www.bmw-m.com BMW M3 Competition Sedan: \n"}

The hustle and bustle begins earliest on almost every day in the port of Hamburg. It is the gateway to the world, as the people of Hamburg say. Indeed, shipping routes connect the Hanseatic city with more than 900 ports in a good 170 countries around the globe. Around 8,000 ship calls per year, almost 300 berths on a total of 43 kilometres of quay walls for seagoing vessels, four modern container terminals, three cruise terminals and 50 handling facilities for roll-on roll-off and general cargo shipments of all kinds, as well as around 7,300 logistics companies within the city limits. 136.6 million tonnes of cargo passed over the quaysides of Germany's largest seaport in 2019. This includes around 9.3 million standard containers. This makes Hamburg the third largest container port in Europe. Even though the port is located about 100 kilometres from the mouth of the Elbe into the North Sea, it is still considered a seaport because it can be accessed by freighters with a draught of up to 15 metres.Thanks to its many international connections, Hamburg's city emblem is also known around the world. It shows a white castle with black contours on a red background – a colour combination that also suits the MINI Cooper 3-door And then you hear a hit from the heyday of the classic Mini: \"On the road again\" by Canned Heat. \n"}

{"prompt":"Three questions for the International Women's Day 2021: Did you know that a woman put the fastest MINI ever built on the road? Did you know that the first purely electric MINI was developed under the direction of a woman? Did you know that the design of the alleged \"most masculine\" of all MINI models was shaped by a woman? ->","completion":" Munich. In Berlin, 8th March is a public holiday. In Munich, men and women work on International Women's Day. In everyday working life at MINI, progress towards true equality has long been evident on the personnel tables for departments, responsibilities and management positions of all kinds. \"We are all different - but good together\" is a motto here, the meaning of which is constantly demonstrated in practice. There is no other way for a globally active premium car manufacturer to be, when on average half of its vehicles are bought and driven by women.The struggle for equality will only be successfully concluded when it no longer needs to be talked about. Until then, exceptional women in the MINI team provide plenty of inspiration for female self-confidence. Three of them will be introduced here. They are examples of strong women who have taken the helm at key positions at MINI and have got to where they are simply because they are the best at what they do..Did you know that a woman put the fastest MINI ever built on the road?Petra Beck attended a girls' secondary school for modern languages and then decided to study electrical engineering. \"I didn't really realise at the time of the decision that it would be a culture shock,\" she recalls. \"I was just excited about maths and physics and wanted to choose a degree that would give me as many opportunities as possible.\" In her degree programme, the proportion of women was then less than ten per cent. After starting her career, things were not much different. In international projects she supervised as a systems engineer in the aerospace industry, where male colleagues were clearly the majority. Five years of process consulting between sales, production and supplier management followed. What does it take to hold your own in a male domain? \"You have to be really interested, enthusiastic and also have a little stamina,\" says Petra Beck. And at some point, according to her experience, competence and personality are what count the most. \"Basically, especially as a manager, all topics - no matter how technical they are - are first and foremost people's business.\" However, the solid basis from her development work as an engineer has often helped her to gain acceptance more quickly.Petra Beck has been working for the BMW Group since 2007, where it is obvious \"that a lot has happened in terms of diversity in recent years\". And when it comes to this topic she believes that \"I always prefer to be part of the process rather than just a spectator\". Exciting products, a great team, international work and diverse tasks - all that appeals to her about her job as vehicle project manager at MINI, which she has been doing for two years. One of the highlights so far has been to accompany the series development of the fastest MINI ever produced, in a leading role.The MINI John Cooper Works GP is an extremely racy rarity with its 225 kW\/306 hp four-cylinder engine and a production run of 3000 units. Despite its imposing appearance, this MINI is also a really likeable car, finds the project manager. \"I like it when the car puts a smile on the face of other road users. That's exactly what happens in every MINI.\" And that also happens at classic car rallies, which Petra Beck likes to take part in in her spare time and is eagerly awaiting their comeback after the pandemic-related break. Did you know that the first purely electric MINI was developed under the direction of a woman? \"Being different is neither good nor bad, it just needs to be understood first,\" says Elena Eder. She has \"diversity\" on her CV and describes herself as a \"child of the world\". Born in Italy, brought up trilingual, raised as a child first in the USA and then in France, she studied mechanical engineering in Italy after graduating from high school, only to be on the road again soon after. Her first professional stations took her to France, Italy, England and Germany as well as to India and China. In the meantime, Elena Eder is a mother of three and has made herself a home at MINI. As project manager, she was instrumental in bringing the first all-electric model of the British premium brand, the MINI Cooper SE , on the road.For Elena Eder, sustainability is a question of attitude, and technology is the instrument to realise it. She already felt a certain enthusiasm for technology as a child. \"I didn't play with dolls, but with cars. And so her professional career also led her into the vehicle industry. \"I always had a fascination for complexity and for beautiful things,\" says Elena Eder. \"And cars are to engineers as a dive on the Great Barrier Reef is to divers.\"The fact that she had to immerse herself in a man's world for this never bothered the engineer much. \"I never wanted to see it as a man's job. I just saw it as a passion, that's where I wanted to go.\" Elena Eder is convinced that determination, openness and a basic attitude that simply takes diversity for granted are the best recipe against the restrictions that still too often stand in the way of women. \"I think everyone should follow their passion and no one should fit into a prejudice or pattern.\" Did you know that the design of the alleged \"manliest\" of all MINI models was shaped by a woman?The MINI Countryman is the largest, most versatile and, in some eyes, described the most \"masculine\" model of the MINI brand. The robust all-rounder owes its expressive design largely to a woman. MINI designer Khrystyne Zurian feels a close connection to this model. \"The MINI Countryman is sporty and versatile, it unleashes a lot of energy in a comparatively small footprint. In a way, it's exactly my lifestyle,\" says the woman who balances an intense workload with snowboarding, surfing, cycling, hiking and crossfit.Khrystyne Zurian's love for MINI awoke during her studies at the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles. A red MINI Cooper S with a black contrasting roof was \"the first car I had an immediate emotional connection to.\" And that's saying something for a woman who comes from a \"truck family\". In the south of the US state of California where she grew up, pickups with large-volume V8 engines were the preferred mode of transport. Aside from her passion for drawing, Khrystyne Zurian also developed an interest in cars at an early age. Together with her brothers she regularly accompanied her father, who ran his own design studio. There they created concept and film vehicles, including the \"Batmobiles\" and other vehicles for various superhero blockbusters. \"It was a creative world that I really wanted to be a part of,\" Khrystyne Zurian recalls.It was during her studies that Khrystyne Zurian realised exactly where she most wanted to express her creativity. It was the character of her red MINI that captivated her. \"At that time I fell in love with the brand. I knew that one day I wanted to work for MINI.\" In 2010, that day had come, and Khrystyne Zurian remembers well that she was almost a little intimidated at the beginning. This was not so much because she encountered a male domain in the automotive industry, but \"because I suddenly met so many talented designers in the studio\". But at MINI she quickly learned to develop self-confidence and trust in her own abilities. \"The only obstacles that stood in my way were those I had built up for myself,\" Khrystyne Zurian knows today. She is all the more pleased about the togetherness in the small community of MINI exterior designers. \"The team spirit at MINI is really something special.\" For her, one of the most challenging tasks is laying the foundations for the character of a new model, wrestling with the demands of technology and fighting for good design in the process. Being successful in these processes is no longer a question of gender, says Khrystyne Zurian. \"There are now quite a few women rocking the automotive industry, and it just seems to be increasing more and more.\"\n"}

At ‘Formula E: Accelerate’, BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Team Redline with Kevin Siggy (SLO) and BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Team GB with Petar Brljak (SVK) competed against the best sim racers in the world in the BMW iFE.21 on the rFactor 2 platform. Both teams and the drivers can look back on a very successful month. On the Hong Kong circuit, Siggy repeated his third-place finish from the season-opener and then followed that up with his first win on the Berlin racetrack. Starting from pole position, he gave a commanding performance to cross the line in first place. Brljak finished third in Berlin to secure his first podium of the season. He had claimed seventh place in Hong Kong. These great results see BMW i Andretti Motorsport top the team standings, with 80 points after three out of six events. Siggy is second in the drivers’ championship with 59 points, behind Erhan Jajovski (MKD, 68 points). The two remaining races and the Grand Final, where drivers can earn double points, take place in March. -- Interview with Kevin Siggy. Kevin, after two third-place finishes you achieved your first win of the season in race three. What went better this time? Kevin Siggy: “First and foremost, it was qualifying. As always, it was extremely tight but I managed to get out in front after an error-free lap. That proved to be the key to victory. Behind me, Frederik Rasmussen would only have had the chance to overtake at the start or by making better use of the ATTACK MODE, but I had that under control.” You won the ‘Race at Home Challenge’ last year. Has the competition got even tougher this season? Siggy: “The competition has definitely got harder. The entire field is just top-class. Effectively, you have to get every turn perfect to win against these guys. I didn’t manage that in the first two qualifying sessions of the season, which meant I didn’t start from the front. This time it happened to Erhan Jajovski, who won the first two races. You can see you really have to get it exactly right on your lap and hope that your closest competitors make at least one mini error. Half of one tenth of a second is often enough.” Second place in the drivers’ standings and first place in the team championship: how do you view the situation in the overall standings after three out of six races? Siggy: “It is good that I have got closer to Erhan Jajovski in the drivers’ standings. I feel that there is always less pressure on the chasing driver, but everything will be decided in the Grand Final, where we can score double points. I don’t think that anyone will be able to build up a big enough lead before then so I am concentrating totally on the final race. There is no prize money on offer for the team championship title but it still feels very prestigious to me as it shows that Petar Brljak and I have done a good job as drivers for the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Teams. Peter is a very good team-mate, who can record a top result at any time – as he proved recently with his third place. I feel that the fact that we are both strong gives us an advantage in the team standings – especially compared to the teams for my two closest challengers in the drivers’ championship, Erhan Jajovski and Frederik Rasmussen. I am optimistic about our chances in the team championship.” -- Energy management in the virtual Formula E.Within ‘Formula E: Accelerate’, the races held on the rFactor 2 simulation platform are transferring Formula E features like energy management and ATTACK MODE from real motorsport to the world of virtual racing for the first time. To help them master this new sim racing challenge, BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams Redline and GB are receiving support from BMW Motorsport performance engineers, who are sharing their experience gained in real Formula E with the sim racers. They provided the drivers with a basic knowledge of energy management in Formula E, and helped them to adapt their know-how as well as possible to the conditions provided by the simulation. “I had no idea that you have to save so much energy in Formula E in order to cover the full distance. It took me quite a while to find out how to do a lap, on which I was quick but also managed to save sufficient energy,” said Siggy and explained: “After consulting the BMW Motorsport engineers, I had to find a way to take their information and adapt it so that it would work for me in the simulation.” The story linked below explains the crucial details of energy management in the real Formula E and what is required to transfer as much knowledge as possible from real motor racing to the very specific characteristics of the simulation. Link to complete story -- BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Teams.Since the start of 2021, BMW Motorsport SIM Racing has been collaborating with four big sim racing teams: BS+COMPETITION, G2 Esports, Team Redline and Williams Esports. They took part in numerous races as official BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams in February, celebrating successes in virtual BMW racing cars. SimGrid Endurance Cup.The BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Team G2 Esports claimed the first podium finish of the year in the 4h Paul Ricard, the penultimate race of the season in the SimGrid Endurance Cup on the Assetto Corsa Competizione platform. Nils Naujoks and Arthur Kammerer (both GER) employed smart tactics and gave a consistent performance as they finished third in the virtual BMW M6 GT3. The duo started from seventh place but timed the tyre change perfectly as the rain came in, a decision that allowed them to move up significantly. After 121 laps, Naujoks and Kammerer finished about 20 seconds behind the winner. DNLS.Team BMW Bank and BMW Team GB were representing BMW Motorsport SIM Racing in the virtual BMW M4 GT3 in the fourth and penultimate race of the season in the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series DNLS. It proved to be an unfortunate race for both teams as they finished in fifth and twelfth places. Nonetheless, BMW still had reason to celebrate. Laurin Heinrich (GER) and Rainer Talvar (EST) gave a commanding performance at the wheel of the #89 BMW M4 GT3 competing for BS+COMPETITION, winning the race and already securing the title in the GT3 class. iRacing 12h Bathurst.At the second iRacing Special of the season, the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams BS+COMPETITION, GB and Redline were competing with the BMW M4 GT3 on the virtual Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst. However, racing luck deserted them on this occasion and they were unable to build on the great result from the iRacing 24h Daytona in January, where Team BMW Bank celebrated the GT3 class win. BMW Team Redline, with drivers Maximilian Benecke, Patrik Holzmann and Jonas Wallmeier (all GER) overcame serious damage to the car to finish eighth as the best-placed BMW crew. BMW Team BS+COMPETITION and Team BMW Bank endured difficulties during the twelve-hour race, crossing the line in 15th and 20th positions. BMW Team GB retired early. The best-placed BMW M4 GT3 was in third place, racing for the Logitech G Altus Esports team.\n"}

From Ólafur Elíasson, Cao Fei and Stefan Sagmeister to Jonas Kaufmann, Sir Simon Rattle, the Munich Philharmonic and the Teatro dell’Opera di Roma to Esther Mahlangu and Victoria Siddall. The BMW Group is receiving manifold congratulatory messages from the international cultural world these days, all of them reflecting its long-term and diverse cultural commitment. For 50 years and with over 100 initiatives in the fields of modern and contemporary art, classical music, jazz and sound as well as architecture and design, the BMW Group has been an integral part of culture on a global scale.It all started with three large-scale paintings by German artist Gerhard Richter commissioned by Eberhard von Kuenheim, then chairman of the board at BMW AG, in 1971. Ever since the opening of the iconic four-cylinder headquarters building by Karl Schwanzer in 1973, the three works titled “Rot”, “Gelb” and “Blau” have been on display within the entrance hall of the company’s headquarters and became the nucleus for the social responsibility of a business enterprise which also engages in intercultural dialogue way beyond its core business.“Culture is a vehicle for change, the artistic venture takes place at the intersection to the future. This is where BMW risks innovation as well. And while different in content, the underlying attitude is the same. Visualizing ways towards innovation is an integral part of BMW as much as it is of cultural creativity,” said Eberhard von Kuenheim, then chairman of the board at BMW AG, in 1984.Maximilian Schöberl, Head of BMW Group Corporate and Intergovernmental Affairs and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Spielmotor München e.V. notes, “Especially in times of great societal change, the values of each individual continue to serve as a guideline for their actions. Corporate citizenship is precisely that: it acts as the guiding principle of a company’s value system. What can we return to the society which enables our business success? I am proud to say that the BMW Group, besides maintaining creative freedom at any time, has always continued to pursue an open exchange and intercultural dialogue and is therefore able to enable many long-term and sustainable partnerships.”It is unique experiences and encounters that promote intercultural dialogue and reflect the principles and attitude of a company within the cultural world. With its broad and diverse network of partners, the cultural commitment of the BMW Group facilitates the creation of current narratives and helps to connect people all across the world – both physically and virtually. As a corporate citizen, the BMW Group believes in the importance of contributing to society in a sustainable way – in the past, present and in the future.50 years of BMW Group Cultural Engagement – 50 years of encounters Over five decades, the BMW Group has been engaged in partnerships with some of the most renowned cultural institutions worldwide based on mutual respect and curiosity which makes its cultural commitment a reliable actor in the cultural field. The BMW Group is grateful for a video campaign that shows the congratulatory messages arriving from around the world and will present them via social media throughout the year.Marc Spiegler, Global Director of Art Basel, which should have celebrated its 50 years of existence last year, sent his congratulations and is looking forward to a double anniversary in 2021, “Now, since we are not going to count 2020, we can celebrate our 50 years together.” Artist Jeff Koons sent his video message including the words, “Animate – inanimate, inside – outside, body – vehicle, DNA – BMW.” Kate Bryan, Head of Collections Soho House, builds miniatures of the BMW Art Car Collection and races them, Hans Ulrich Obrist’s congratulatory message is ended by a seagull, whereas the one by Cao Fei closes with a paradisiac bird-like creature. Jazz musician Hannah Weiss sings “Congratulations” and artist Okuyama Hoseki stops his craftsmanship to send his best wishes from Japan.The broad range of those participating includes important personalities from every cultural sector – from artists, musicians and designers to curators, gallery owners and museum directors as well as to collectors and race drivers.BMW Group Cultural Engagement received congratulations from i.a.: Antoniu-Theodor Andreescu (musician), Richard Armstrong (Director, Solomon R.

{"prompt":"After a journey of discovery through deep snow-covered forests, it is precisely the silence of the vast landscape that makes a tour at the Arctic Circle so appealing. One of the most beautiful routes leads from Kemi in Finland to the Lofoten archipelago - from the Gulf of Bothnia over snow-blown roads across Swedish Lapland to the Norwegian Arctic Sea.  ->","completion":" Munich. The distance from sea to sea is around 1,500 kilometers. Ideal conditions for learning to appreciate the qualities of a four-wheel-drive all-rounder.Mother nature builds the most beautiful roads in the Arctic Circle region of Finland. Every year in November, she starts building them, and at the end of April, the spring sun takes them away again. These roads are made of gravel, snow and ice, run over frozen waters and through snow-covered forests. They lead through wilderness and untouched nature between large and heart-straight grown firs.For locals, these thousands of kilometers of winter trails are an important part of the daily road network – for outdoor adventurers, discovering the Arctic Circle on these trails is an intense nature experience. Resting somewhere in the winter white, watching passing herds of reindeer and listening to the soft sounds of the forest. With a little luck, the night sky above all this even burns off a spectacular fireworks display of auroras. The MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 has just the right characteristics for an extensive round trip through the winter landscape in northern Europe.The versatile all-rounder from the British premium brand not only impresses with its sporty and safe handling on the road, but thanks to its electronically controlled all-wheel drive and a ground clearance of 16.5 centimeters, it is also in its element on excursions on deep snow-covered dirt roads. And with a luggage compartment volume that can be expanded from 450 to up to 1,390 liters by folding down the rear seat backrest, as well as with its optional roof rails and the railing rack including roof box available in the Genuine MINI Accessories range, the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 is a perfect choice for the Arctic Circle.Those who set out on the three-country tour in Kemi, Finland, have the opportunity to admire the largest castle in the world built of snow and ice: SnowCastle. Every year local architects build the castle new and always different. Sometimes a snow tower is over 20 meters high, sometimes the castle wall is over a kilometer long. Inside, tourists can spend the night on ice benches and dine on reindeer skins in the igloo restaurant. Room temperature: minus three degrees.Heading west, the road follows the rugged coastline of the Gulf of Bothnia with its fjords cut deep into the forests for about 160 kilometers. In winter, the archipelago with its countless islands becomes a coherent landscape. Ice roads connect the islands with each other and with the mainland. In the northern Swedish coastal town of Luleå, a detour to Gammelstad is worthwhile. A tranquil church village with red-painted wooden houses, just as known from travel guides. All of them carry a good meter of snow on the roof. Gammelstad is the largest preserved church town in Sweden and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 408 houses and the stone building of the Nederluleå church from 1492 are still preserved.Enough culture and history? About 120 kilometers to the northwest a spectacular natural phenomenon can be seen. Signposts lead to it over snow-covered gravel roads. No problem for the robust MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4. Directly and perfectly, the all-wheel drive system distributes the power of its 131 kW\/178 hp four-cylinder engine to all four wheels as needed. After a short, rapid drive, the roar of the mighty waters of the Storforsen can be heard. Gigantic rapids that plunge up to 82 meters into the depths.With a length of five kilometers, the Storforsen is one of the longest rapids in Scandinavia and forms the center of the nature reserve of the same name, which includes untouched river landscapes, lush spruce forest and countless small waterfalls. For a longer stay, vacation cabins with a view of the rapids are available on the premises.After a stopover in Arjeplog, Sweden, the Arctic Circle is soon crossed. Far from prying eyes, BMW Group vehicle developers complete many test drives with prototypes of new BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce models in this sparsely populated region of northern Sweden. Turn in, accelerate, countersteer, stabilize: The snowy tracks and icy surfaces, on which suspension technology and driving stability systems can be so perfectly fine-tuned, make it tempting to hone the art of drifting with the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4, which is also ideally equipped for such maneuvers.From Arjeplog, the so-called Silvervägen climbs up into the wintry Fjell. The Silver Trail fulfills every Scandinavian cliché on this passage – from moss-green plains and bubbling streams to grazing reindeer. Its name recalls the time when the Silver Trail was more dirt road than road, and mined silver was transported there on reindeer backs and sleds.After 150 kilometers, the Silver Trail crosses the Swedish-Norwegian border at an altitude of 750 meters. A little later, the snow-covered peak of Solvågtind comes into view. The 1,559-meter-high mountain is part of Junkerdal National Park, one of Norway's largest and most unspoiled areas with an area of 682,000 square kilometers. The Silver Trail leads here through almost deserted territory to Bodø. With four driven wheels and supported by the lightning-fast DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) including Performance Control and Electronic Differential Lock Control (EDLC), the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 pulls away on snow-covered roads amid wild birch forests and on narrow, winding mountain roads.From Bodø, a ferry departs twice a day for Lofoten, a group of islands off the coast of northern Norway. It takes just under three and a half breathtaking hours to sail past vast numbers of tiny islands and in great Nordic silence toward Moskenes. Red fishermen's houses on wooden piles cling to the narrow sea bay like birds' nests to rock faces. Moskenes is located on the westernmost Lofoten island of Moskenesøya – framed by the jagged cliffs of the Lofoten Wall towering more than 800 meters high. This is the name of the mighty mountain range in the south of the archipelago, whose age is estimated by geologists at 3.5 billion years.From Moskenes, the main traffic artery, the European Road 10, leads over bridges and through tunnels to the neighboring islands, which have such wondrous names as Flakstadøya, Vestvagøya, Litlemolla and Skrova. The aurora season begins there in early February. Lofoten lies just below the so-called auroral oval – a belt where the probability of observing the mystical celestial phenomenon is particularly high. After almost 1,500 kilometers of driving pleasure in the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4, the colorful spectacle in the night sky is just the right end to a great tour to the northernmost edge of Europe. \n"}

The opening weekend of Season 7 in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship did not go as expected for the BMW i Andretti Motorsport team and drivers. Accidents during Saturday’s race in the Diriyah E-Prix (KSA) led to early retirements for Maximilian Günther (GER) and Jake Dennis (GBR). Both drivers didn’t score points in the double-header in Diriyah. The next race is scheduled to take place in Rome (ITA) on 10th April. Günther, who also saw his Friday race come to a premature end after an accident, collided with Tom Blomqvist (GBR, NIO) around ten minutes before the end battling for a top ten finish, bringing the BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car onto the track. The race was brought to an early conclusion shortly afterwards. A few minutes earlier, Dennis was not at fault as he was pushed into the wall and then forced to park his damaged BMW iFE.21. Victory went to Sam Bird (GBR, Jaguar). Reactions to race 2 in Diriyah: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport, team standings: 12th place):“Two days in a row we didn’t get the results we wanted. Yesterday was frustrating, Today, even more so, as both drivers had the chance to score points and ended up with DNFs. The day started with a challenge as we had to fit the battery back into Maximilian’s car after yesterday’s crash but all the mechanics did a great job. Despite a very late delivery of the battery, we only lost a few minutes of time in free practice. In qualifying we didn’t make the most of our opportunities. We felt the race would come to us in the final stages looking at energy management but in the end it wasn’t meant to be. We now try to put the Diriyah races behind us and move on to Europe.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 17th place, race result: DNF, points: 0, driver standings: 18th place):“A bad day in the office for all of us with two DNFs. My race was going pretty well before my crash. I was saving a lot of energy and it looked good for the final laps of the race. Then Alexander Sims hit me first, I touched the wall and had a bit of suspension damage but the car was still driveable. Then Pascal Wehrlein came and pushed me straight into the wall. There was nothing I could do. All in all we could have had a better weekend. I had problems in qualifying; the race pace was good. Now we have to move on to the next one.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 11th place, race result: DNF, points: 0, driver standings: 23rd place):“I’m obviously very disappointed about the results of these two races in Diriyah. Right before the incident in today’s race I had to defend against Oliver Rowland behind me, who was in Attack Mode. I locked up braking into the corner on the inside and couldn’t stop the car. That’s how I unfortunately hit Tom Blomqvist. Before that I was unlucky using my own Attack Modes and couldn’t really make use of them. But still I could have scored some points. We will learn our lessons from this weekend and come back stronger for sure.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race. The five drivers with the most FANBOOST votes receive an extra 100 kJ of power, which they can make use of during a brief time frame in the second half of the race. Fans can vote for their favourite driver in the four days prior to, and leading up to 15 minutes into, each race. Each fan can vote once per day.

BMW Motorsport and Andretti Formula E will remain connected after their joint works involvement in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship draws to a close. The final Formula E season for the BMW i Andretti Motorsport works team begins this weekend, but Andretti Formula E will return to compete as an independent team in Season 8 using the BMW Racing eDrive03 drivetrain in its cars once again. Ahead of the current season, the drivetrain was homologated for another two years, meaning that it is available for the team to use for one more season. “We are delighted to be able to continue to support Andretti Formula E,” said Mike Krack, BMW Motorsport Head of Test & Race Operations. “We are convinced that the BMW Racing eDrive03 will allow Andretti Formula E to achieve top results. Working purely as a drivetrain supplier, we will no longer be involved directly in events at the racetrack in Season 8 but we will provide the team with support in response to any technical questions regarding the BMW Racing eDrive03.” “We’re really pleased to continue competition with BMW Motorsport as a privateer team in Season 8,” said team owner Michael Andretti. “As a works team, BMW i Andretti Motorsport has enjoyed shared success and we look forward to building on that as we continue on with Andretti Formula E. The BMW i drivetrain has proven to be reliable and competitive, and we look forward to putting it to work for another season.” “The choice to continue with BMW as our drivetrain supplier for Season 8 was an easy one,” said Andretti Formula E Team Principal Roger Griffiths. “Over the last two seasons with the BMW i Andretti Motorsport works programme it has delivered four wins, shown proven reliability and excellent efficiency. The team understands the operational aspects of the BMW Racing eDrive03 well and therefore the expectation is that Andretti Formula E can be highly competitive for the final season of the Gen2 era.” The BMW Racing eDrive03, which is being used in Seasons 7 and 8 as the BMW i drivetrain in Formula E, has benefited from detailed improvements when compared to its predecessor. Thanks to experience gained over the past few years, it has been adapted to deal even more adeptly with the unique challenges posed by Formula E circuits. The main goal of the modifications is to improve the efficiency of the drivetrain. The E engine attains a maximum efficiency of 98 percent and its power density is higher than 14kW\/kg. Its maximum rotational speed is more than 30,000 rpm. The inverter works with a direct current of up to 900 volts and achieves a power density of more than 45 kW\/kg. In this latest version, the carbon inverter housing has been replaced by one made of Kevlar.\n"}

{"prompt":"Fresh design accents and the unique Multitone Roof enhance the appeal of the first five-seater in the British premium brand's small car range. Already more than 500 000 units sold worldwide. Market launch of the new edition begins in March 2021.  ->","completion":" Munich. In the MINI premium small car model range, the new MINI 5 door is the prime example of how creatively space can be used in typical MINI style. The MINI 5 door combines characteristic driving fun and individual style with a large dose of functionality. Now, fresh design accents, the Multitone Roof, which is unique in the competitive environment, a high-grade refined interior and additional equipment features make the five-door body variant of the MINI even more attractive. The market launch of the new edition of the MINI 5 door will begin in March 2021.The MINI 5 door offers all the qualities of a small car from the British premium brand, plus clear gains in comfort and space for passengers and luggage. The wheelbase, which is 72 millimetres longer than that of the MINI 3 door, and the increased body length of 160 millimetres make all the difference. In urban traffic, the MINI 5 door is also extremely agile and can cope with tight parking spaces if need be. At the same time, three seats are available in the rear. Passengers in the second row benefit from the additional doors when getting in the car and then from noticeably more interior width, legroom and headroom. In addition, the interior is particularly versatile. The luggage compartment volume can be increased by folding down the standard 60: 40 split rear seat backrests from 278 litres to up to 941 litres as required.Combining driving fun and the practical benefits met with great approval from the very beginning. With the new vehicle concept for the small car segment, MINI was able to inspire additional target groups to enjoy its hallmark driving fun. More than 500 000 units of the MINI 5 door have already been sold worldwide. In 2020 alone, more than 56 000 MINI fans opted for this model.With the precisely modified design of the MINI 5 door, the best conditions for a continuing this success story have now been created. The new, reduced and particularly clear design language directs the eye to the essentials. At the front of the car, the hexagonal radiator grille and the round headlights are the defining design features even to a greater extent than before. LED headlights are now standard, as are the LED rear lights in the distinctive Union Jack design. Vertical air intakes replace the fog lights, whose function is now taken over by the bad weather light. Like the Matrix function for the high beam, it is part of the Adaptive LED Headlights option. In addition, the bumper unit, now painted in body colour, contributes to the modern, high-quality look of the front end.In addition to the extended scope of the Piano Black exterior option, the Multitone Roof, which is also available as an optional extra, offers new possibilities for individualizing the exterior of the MINI 5-door. As the roof surface has been extended in parallel with the wheelbase compared with the MINI 3-door, the appeal of the flowing colour gradient from San Marino Blue in the front to Pearly Aqua in the middle to Jet Black in the rear of the Multitone Roof can unfold particularly effectively. The successive application of the three colour tones is fully integrated into the machine production process at the British MINI plant in Oxford. Nevertheless, the slightest deviations in the colour pattern can always occur during painting due to changing external conditions. As a result, every MINI 5-door with Multitone Roof rolls off the production line as a unique piece.The Multitone Roof can be combined with almost all exterior paint finishes available for the MINI 5-door, including the new Rooftop Grey metallic variant. The equally powerful and elegant grey tone for the bodywork, which extends slightly into silver, is an ideal complement to the shimmering colour spectacle on the roof.In the interior of the MINI 5 door, the generous amount of space now harmonises with high-grade and advanced cockpit design and new comfort features. The centre air vents, which are flush with the interior surfaces, and the new design of the central instrument cluster, which now houses an 8.8-inch touch display as standard, emphasise the modern premium ambience. The highlights on the driver's side are the optional multifunctional instrument display and the now standard sports leather steering wheel with redesigned multifunctional button panels. For cold days, steering wheel heating is now also available as an optional extra for the first time.Illumination and lights also contribute more than ever to feeling snug and comfortable in the interior of the MINI 5 door. The graphic display on the central instrument display and on the digital cockpit display can be varied depending on your mood. The \"Lounge\" and \"Sport\" modes are available, each with its own colour scheme. The settings for the displays can be matched to the MINI Driving Modes as well as combined with the colour worlds of the new Ambient Light option. In this way, you can create a particularly atmospheric ambience in the MINI 5 door. \n"}

From 1 April, modern, coordinated and mutually supportive communication will be launched across all channels. Corporate and brand messages are brought into line with each other and linked to the respective target groups. In the age of the editorial society, public relations and brand communication are thus experiencing a fundamental renaissance. ->","completion":" Munich. Attention has become a crucial commodity in the digital age. The power of product brands, but also corporate brands, is often the decisive factor in highly competitive markets. Successful companies and brands have a clear profile, communicate creatively and differentiate themselves through positive emotions.The BMW Group has decided to take an innovative and fundamentally new approach to corporate communication, brand management and brand communication: The company is realigning its corporate and marketing communications for the BMW brand with regard to organisation and content and has formed a customised agency model for this purpose with TheGame Group, which is made up of some of the best and most distinguished agencies in Europe. The shareholders of TheGame Group are the Experience One GmbH and Jung von Matt AG. The agency will work exclusively for the BMW Group for the first few years. With Tim Wagner and Max Lederer as well as and Marc Schumacher, experienced heads could already be won for TheGame Group. The extended operational management team of TheGame Group is currently being established.The BMW Group expects this to lead to an effective orchestration of the areas of brand campaign, brand experience, brand content, brand protection and public relations. In the future strategically developed and coordinated brand and corporate narratives will be communicated in a way that is appropriate to the target group and channel. In addition, all communication is data-driven and dynamically adapted in real time to audience response and current developments.The holistically designed communication strategy will ensure that both the company and BMW enter into a dialogue with the respective target groups with the same tonality and approach across all touch points. \"The strict separation of corporate and marketing communication into B2B on the one hand and B2C on the other no longer corresponds to the realities of communication in the 21st century. At the digital campfire, the best stories and the most valuable information are what counts\" says Maximilian Schöberl, Chief Representative of BMW AG. \"One Voice has already been implemented in corporate communications at the BMW Group - now we are entering a new era of collaboration with marketing and brand communications. Especially in a time of rapid change, we are being challenged to develop innovative solutions and not only to lead the pack with our products, but also to develop the most modern and innovative communication infrastructure in the market. We are experiencing a renaissance of public relations.“ The BMW Group and its brands are engaged in a constant and increasingly intensive dialogue with a wide range of external and internal target groups and stakeholders: from potential and existing customers to employees, media representatives, investors, legislators, NGOs, Brand Friends, influencers and many more. This makes it all the more important to orchestrate communication, which, despite all the stringency of content, is also able to respond to the specific requirements of target groups and channels. The richness of facets and polyphony thus blend into a harmonious whole.\"Companies increasingly need to become broadcasters of their own brands if they want to stay relevant and address a community. That's why we see “brand” as a media platform,\" says Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President Customer and Brand BMW. \"In an increasingly fragmented media landscape, power of interpretation and efficient dialogue can only be achieved by joining forces and focusing.” With our approach, we are creating a new standard of modern communication.\"TheGame Group is an agency tailor-made for the needs of BMW. It completes the new agency model that BMW established last autumn with the founding THE THE MARCOM ENGINE: While the THE THE MARCOM ENGINE takes on the task of empowering all digital product communication in all European markets, TheGame Group focuses on innovative, data-driven, high-quality creative and strategic work in corporate and brand communication. In future, the aim is to stage the brand internationally across all channels with a maximum of creativity and efficiency.\"If Jung von Matt was a car, it would be a BMW. This quote has been true for us for over twenty years - and today more than ever. We share a passion for what we make, we believe in continuous innovation and we are proud to be shareholders in TheGame Group”, says Peter Figge, member of the board of Jung von Matt AG.Vincent Bodo Andrin, founder of the Experience One GmbH and ZEITGEIST Group states: \"The interplay of marketing and public relations opens up completely new and enormous perspectives for creating genuine brand experiences: by involving all the senses for all relevant target groups. What we are creating replaces many inefficient interfaces and opens up unimagined possibilities.\"For the area of corporate communications, TheGame Group will cooperate with the newly founded British offshoot of the Looping Group, Looping Group International Ltd in London. This new company will be responsible for the areas of public relations and social media. \"Consistently converging marketing and communications is in our DNA. That is why we are very pleased that TheGame Group approached us,\" says Michael Karg, Chief Operating Officer of Looping Group International and head of the London office from which BMW's international social media publishing will be managed in future.\n"}

Meat, skin, wax, confetti, blood, intestines, odors, senses, smoke, ritual, alcohol, excess, touch, singing, fat, and ashes: these are some of the soft, rough, gentle, and coarse materials the artist Pauline Curnier Jardin employs in her works. The winner of the Preis der Nationalgalerie 2019 presents the extensive video installation “Fat to Ashes”, which she produced for her first institutional solo exhibition in Germany, in the historic hall of Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin. The exhibition runs from the reopening of the museums of Berlin onwards until September 19, 2021. BMW supports the Preis der Nationalgalerie as exclusive partner for 15 years now.“Fat to Ashes” combines three cinematic snapshots: a religious festival in honor of Saint Agatha; the slaughter of a pig; and the Cologne Carnival. Thereby, the exhibition’s title denotes the week of excess that runs from so-called “Fat Thursday” or “giovedì grasso” and known as “Weiberfastnacht” or “Fettdonnerstag” in German, until Ash Wednesday which marks the day reality sets back in and Lent begins according to the Christian Calendar. Jardin shows these three spheres of activity as places of transgression and transformation which bring societal functions originating in cult rituals into the present: those of congregating together, performative display, and the exuberant abandonment of prevailing mores.An Italian dessert, for example, which recreates the shape of a breast and is eaten on the feast day commemorating the martyrdom of Saint Agatha. The slaughter of the pig takes place far from industrial factory-farming on a traditional rural farm. The images of the Cologne Carnival, on the other hand, are full of life. Looking back at the carnival events, the festivities read like a last great collective debauchery just before Covid would lead to a country-wide lockdown, as people viewing the film today now know. A broad amphitheater encompasses the video installation as the center of the spectacle, and thus transformations, processions, and practiced performance in ritualized excess are the content and formal attributes of Pauline Curnier Jardin’s “Fat to Ashes”.A catalogue in German and English will be published by Buchhandlung Walther König to mark the exhibition, with contributions by Pauline Curnier Jardin, Sara Giannini, Ana Teixera Pinto, Kristina Schrei and Giovanna Zapperi.The Preis der Nationalgalerie is enabled by the Freunde der Nationalgalerie since 2000 to reward the winner with a solo exhibition as well as an accompanying publication. The Preis der Nationalgalerie focuses on young important positions of today. Artists of all nationalities are eligible if they are currently working in Germany and are less than 40 years old. Previous awardees amongst others were Monica Bonvicini .Due to the pandemic situation the exhibition dates are subject of change.

From March 2021 the MINI Cooper SE will bring even more hallmark driving pleasure to the world of electric mobility thanks to fresh design accents and new equipment features. The new MINI Electric Collection really sets the scene for the first purely electrically powered model by the British premium brand. The edition model combines the visual highlights developed for the latest edition of the MINI, such as the redesigned front end and the Multitone Roof, with exclusive design features in the exterior and interior as well as high-quality equipment details.A reduced design language now also ensures that the round headlights and the hexagonal radiator grille are emphasised even more clearly as typical design features of the vehicle front on the MINI Cooper SE. The scope of equipment of the edition vehicles includes the exterior paint finish Island Blue metallic, offered for the first time for the MINI Cooper SE. Alternatively, the new colour variant Rooftop Grey metallic is available. The MINI Electric Collection also includes the Multitone Roof, which is unique in the MINI competitive environment. With the aid of a new paintwork technique, the MINI plant in Oxford has created a fascinating colour gradient from San Marino Blue through Pearly Aqua to Jet Black, extending from the windscreen frame to the rear.The exclusive-design bonnet and side stripes also contribute to the car’s expressive appearance and, with their subtle colour gradient, stylishly complement the Multitone Roof. Black exterior mirror caps, 17-inch MINI Electric Collection Spoke light-alloy wheels and Piano Black high-gloss exterior elements, including the grille, headlamp and rear lamp surrounds, MINI logos, rear model lettering, door handles and side scuttles, all add to the understated, sporty look.In addition, the MINI Electric Collection features Adaptive LED headlights including a matrix function for the high beam, door sill trims with a printed MINI Electric logo, sports seats in Light Grey fabric\/leatherette combination, newly designed interior surfaces in MINI Yours Aluminium finish and an anthracite-coloured roof lining. The refined premium character of the interior is also enhanced by the sports leather steering wheel in nappa finish, which also features a MINI Electric logo in the edition vehicles.The MINI Electric Collection offers a particularly exclusive way to experience locally emission-free driving pleasure. The spontaneous power delivery of the 135 kW\/184 hp electric motor, the model-specific chassis set-up and the low centre of gravity enable the MINI Cooper SE to deliver hallmark MINI agility. The lithium-ion high-voltage battery, located deep in the vehicle floor, enables a range of 203 to 234 kilometres as determined in the WLTP test cycle.Newly compiled equipment packages in the areas of comfort, connectivity and driver assistance are also optionally available for the edition model of the MINI Cooper SE. Steering wheel heating is offered for the first time to increase comfort in cold weather. The standard equipment of the MINI Cooper SE includes the Connected Navigation package. The Connected Navigation Plus package includes a Head-Up Display, telephony with Wireless Charging, Concierge Service and MINI Connected XL features.The new Lane Departure Warning is part of the Driver Assistance Package and alerts the driver to the risk of unintentional lane departure with steering wheel vibrations. The new Driver Assistance Package Plus includes Active Cruise Control, which now features a Stop & Go function for the first time. This enables the system to slow the MINI Cooper SE down to a standstill if necessary. Then all that is needed is a short step on the accelerator pedal to set the car in motion again and continue using the automatic speed and distance control. This provides the driver with effective support, especially in gridlocked traffic, and while driving enjoyment is temporarily restricted, the driver can instead enjoy increased ride comfort.\n"}

The virtual 2021 racing season in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship goes by the name ‘Formula E: Accelerate’. For the first time, the races held on the rFactor 2 simulation platform are transferring Formula E features like energy management and ATTACK MODE from real motorsport to the world of virtual racing. To help them master this new sim racing challenge, BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams Redline and GB are receiving support from BMW Motorsport performance engineers, who are sharing their experience gained in real Formula E with the sim racers. Here’s how the collaboration works. BMW Team Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) is one of the best sim racers on the rFactor 2 platform. In 2020, he took overall victory in the inaugural virtual Formula E competition, the ‘ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge’. Despite his experience, he was extremely surprised when he climbed into the virtual cockpit of the BMW iFE.21 for the initial tests ahead of season two. ‘Formula E: Accelerate’ is different to its predecessor as together with rFactor 2, Formula E has transferred typical features like energy management and ATTACK MODE from reality to simulation. “Energy management is not totally new to me, because we basically don’t do anything differently when it comes to saving fuel during endurance races. But I had no idea that you have to save so much energy in Formula E in order to cover the full distance,” said Siggy. “In the first tests, I thought the game had an error, because I was so far off the energy level I needed to achieve. I had expected to have to coast for perhaps 50 metres – but not 200. It took me quite a while to find out how to do a lap, on which I was quick but also managed to save sufficient energy.” Four stages of energy management.Support for Siggy and BMW Team GB driver Petar Brljak (SVK), who races in the second BMW iFE.21, came in the form of performance engineers from BMW Motorsport’s Formula E project. Jannis Hellwig and Benedikt Schaich are members of the test team responsible for the BMW iFE.21 as a complete car. They provided the drivers from the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams with a basic knowledge of energy management in Formula E, and helped them to adapt their know-how as well as possible to the conditions provided by the simulation. “It is exciting for us to see how much of what we have learned over the years in Formula E we can transfer to a different platform, like sim racing,” said Schaich. Hellwig added: “In reality, the physics behind energy management is very complicated. This is obviously simplified in the simulation, not only on rFactor 2, but we are also familiar with this from our own simulation tools. Our models for the BMW iFE.21 cannot be transferred 1:1 to the simulation.” In a real Formula E car, energy management is subject to various basic rules. One of the most important of these is to use energy at low speeds and save energy at high speed. As a result, energy management primarily takes place on straights – and in four stages: full acceleration out of corners, coast at top speed, maximum regeneration on the rear axle ahead of the next corner and brake into the corner on the front axle. In reality, this process can be adapted and optimised very flexibly. The simulation is less flexible. “With this in mind, after consulting the BMW Motorsport engineers, I had to find a way to take their information and adapt it so that it would work for me in the simulation,” Siggy explained. “For example, on my steering wheel I am unable to change the various levels of regeneration as quickly as Formula E drivers in the real car, so had to simplify the process a little to achieve the necessary energy level.” BMW Motorsport engineers as consultants to sim racers.For Brljak too, having to deal with limited energy has definite consequences during the race, which the BMW Team GB driver first had to get used to: “You are actually thinking about energy management before the race even starts. Should you use a lot of energy at the start to gain places, or save it for later? I think we have several approaches; you can stick to your plan at all times and, in theory, set the fastest race pace, you can save energy at the start to ensure you have reserves for the final few laps, or you can switch between saving and consuming throughout the race. It depends on the race situation.” Correctly evaluating these race situations and then planning the use of ATTACK MODE, which provides an energy boost but can also cost the driver time and possibly track position to activate, is a question of experience. As such, the role of the BMW Motorsport engineers is primarily to advise the sim racers and their teams, thus accelerating the learning process. This is not so different from real motor racing. “The likes of Maximilian Günther also started from scratch when it comes to energy management, and also had to learn it all. Jake Dennis is a new driver on the Formula E scene, so he is still in the middle of this process,” said Hellwig. “As such, they are not that different to the sim racers. The top drivers at BMW i Andretti Motorsport have also had to completely adapt their driving style for Formula E. Experience is hugely important in this regard.” Siggy and Brljak are looking to use this experience in the next ‘Formula E: Accelerate’ race. It starts this evening at 20:00 at the virtual circuit in Hong Kong. The race in livestream: https:\/\/b.mw\/FE_Accelerate_R2. \n"}

BMW Team RLL reached the podium in the GTLM class at the 59th edition of the Rolex 24 at Daytona (USA). After 24 hours of racing at Daytona International Speedway, the #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE secured third place. The #25 car completed the classic race in the US state of Florida in fifth position. The Rolex 24 at Daytona represented the first real major highlight of the GT endurance racing season for BMW Motorsport. Augusto Farfus (BRA), John Edwards (USA), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Marco Wittmann (GER) shared driving duties in the #24 car. Their team-mates Connor De Phillippi (USA), Bruno Spengler (CAN), Philipp Eng (AUT) and Timo Glock (GER) were also involved in the battle for a podium finish for long spells before losing ground due to a technical problem. In the GTD class, the Turner Motorsport team competed in its 400th race with BMW. The #96 BMW M6 GT3 was driven by Robby Foley, Bill Auberlen, Aidan Read and Colton Herta (all USA). After 24 hours of racing, the quartet secured sixth place in their class. The BMW Endurance Challenge, the season-opener in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge 2021, had already taken place at Daytona on Friday. After four thrilling hours of racing, four BMW M4 GT4s crossed the line in positions two to five. Turner Motorsport celebrated a double podium as second place went to #95 with Bill Auberlen and Dillon Machavern (USA), while their team-mates Robby Foley and Vincent Barletta (USA) finished third in the #96 BMW M4 GT4. They were followed in fourth and fifth positions by the #82 car of BimmerWorld Racing and car #43 from Stephen Cameron Racing. The next race event for BMW Team RLL, the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA), is scheduled from 17th to 20th March. Quotes after the Rolex 24 at Daytona: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “It was a tough race; obviously the Corvettes were hooked up and we did the best we could. I wanted better for our guys who had worked so hard. They did a great job but we still have a podium which is not bad in a 24-hour race. With the #25 car we unfortunately had a bit of an issue that cost its chances later on. But still, the drivers did a super job, stayed out of trouble. We have the satisfaction that we did what we could and are now looking forward to Sebring and doing it there.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd place GTLM class): “We all tried our very best so I think we can go home with smiles on our faces. We played it well, but unfortunately this time it just was not enough for the win. For me, it is always an honour to come over to this race; it always welcomes me with arms wide open so I can’t wait to come back again! Thanks to everyone for all the efforts.” John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd place GTLM class): “We really gave it everything today. Unfortunately it just wasn’t enough for the win. I’m really proud of the team, proud to be a part of the team. My co-drivers did a great job and we called the strategy well. Unfortunately, it was not just enough right at the end. Congratulations to Corvette; a well-deserved victory for those guys.” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd place GTLM class): “It was a tough race. We won last year. This year we made the most of what we had but it was not enough. Corvette did an awesome job but that also goes for us - there were no mistakes from the team. And overall, it’s nice to be back on the Daytona podium.” Marco Wittmann (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd place GTLM class): “Overall, a podium finish is a successful result. Of course I was hoping for the win and to go home with a watch, but in the end, we have to admit that the Corvettes had better pace this weekend; they were slightly stronger and were leading nearly the entire race. I think we still can be proud to finish in P3 on the podium. It is the first time for me to stand on the podium in America so that was a great experience.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 5th place GTLM class): “The guys did a great job, they had a flawless race; every pit stop was perfect, the car set-up was great, the strategy was great. We were just unlucky with the issue in the end which took us out of contention, but our luck will turn around at some point. We just have to keep our eye on the prize and go for the win at Sebring.” Bruno Spengler (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 5th place GTLM class): “For sure, I am a bit disappointed about the final result because we had a chance for the podium today. To fight for the win would have been difficult as we saw that our other car, which had a very good pace, was not quite able to go the pace of the Corvettes. So congrats to them; with a one-two, they did a really good job. It was a shame for us that we had that issue in the last hours of the race. A massive thanks to the team and the mechanics; they were fighting so hard through the night and the day, and made everything work perfectly. It’s awesome to work with a team like that. Now we are going to focus very strongly on Sebring. We are going to do everything to bounce back there. Regarding the incident at the start when it was going green, I went on throttle as we do at every start here in IMSA, and the car in front of me did not quite go at the same time as me, so unfortunately I nicked the rear corner of his car. I tried to avoid him but it was just enough to spin him around. That was a bit of an unfortunate situation but definitely not intentional. Unfortunately, on their car there was quite a lot of damage but these things can happen.” Philipp Eng (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 5th place GTLM class): “I once again enjoyed it a lot to be here with BMW Team RLL and BMW North America. We had a great race car with great balance. Unfortunately, we had a technical issue. Otherwise I think we could have had a very good shot at the podium. Congrats to our colleagues in the #24 for their podium finish.” Timo Glock (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 5th place GTLM class): “It was hard that we fell back with, I think, eight hours to go when we suffered an issue that affected the engine performance. Until then, we were running really well in the top-three. Connor was even in the lead at some point and he really did a great job to get us in front of the Corvettes, but this is how 24-hour racing is. The team did a very good job, trying everything, also with the #24 car, to challenge the Corvettes. They were slightly ahead of us but in the end we have to take it like it is. Overall it was a great experience. I enjoyed my first appearance here at Daytona. The team did a fantastic job, the mechanics worked really hard over the run up to get both cars into a good shape, as did the engineers. It was great fun.” \n"}

The next race in the BMW SIM GT Cup takes place at the Suzuka circuit on 7th March. One day later, the second season of the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup gets underway on the rFactor 2 platform with a race at Imola. BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Teams.Since the start of 2021, BMW Motorsport SIM Racing has been collaborating with four big sim racing teams: BS+COMPETITION, G2 Esports, Team Redline and Williams Esports. As official BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams, they competed in a host of races in January and have already tasted success in virtual BMW race cars. iRacing 24h Daytona.The iRacing Special 24h Daytona, on 23rd\/24th January, saw three BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams compete in the same race for the first time. BMW Team BS+COMPETITION, BMW Team Redline and BMW Team GB, which is run by Williams Esports, each fielded one BMW M8 GTE in the GTE class. After 24 hours, Ryan Barneveld (NED), Nathan Lewis and Phillippe Denes (both USA) of BMW Team BS+COMPETITION crossed the finish line in third place to claim a spot on the podium. BMW Team Redline and BMW Team GB came home fifth and sixth in the GTE class. The victorious Triple A Esports team was also in a BMW M8 GTE. The big winners in the GTD class were Laurin Heinrich, Kay Kaschube and Nils Koch (all GER). The BMW Team BS+COMPETITION trio triumphed in the BMW Bank M4 GT3 to claim the first big win for a BMW Motorsport SIM Racing team at this early stage in the season. The next iRacing Special is the 12h Bathurst on 27th February. Formula E: Accelerate.On 28th January, BMW Team Redline and BMW Team GB made their first appearances in the virtual Formula E series. ‘Formula E Accelerate’ saw Kevin Siggy (SLO) and Petar Brljak (CRO) take to the track in the BMW iFE.21 at the circuit in New York. Siggy, who won the ‘ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge’ last year, was in fine form again and finished third to claim a spot on the podium. He also picked up an extra point for the fastest lap of the race. Brljak came home 18th after a tough race. Round two is scheduled for 4th February. Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series.BMW Team BS+COMPETITION and BMW Team GB finished third and fourth when the virtual BMW M4 GT3 made its official iRacing debut in the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series (DNLS) on 16th January. Victory went to the MAHLE RACING TEAM with its BMW M4 GT3. The second BS+COMPETITION car finished second to complete a top-four lock-out for the BMW M4 GT3. The next race takes place on 20th February. SimGrid Endurance Cup.BMW Team G2 Esports got its season up and running on 9th January in the SimGrid Endurance Cup on the Assetto Corsa Competizione platform. Nils Naujoks and Arthur Kammerer (both GER) showed good pace in the BMW M6 GT3 at the 4h Zolder, but lost a lot of time in the pits due to a technical issue within the simulation and consequently missed out on a place in the top-ten. The next race is the 4h Paul Ricard on 6th February. Interview with Laurin Heinrich, Kay Kaschube and Nils Koch. Congratulations on the first win for a BMW Motorsport SIM Racing team at the iRacing 24h Daytona! How did you feel the race went?Laurin Heinrich: “To be honest, it was actually quite a quiet race – thankfully! We were able to maintain our speed consistently and without even the slightest of problems. That was ultimately the key to our victory. Plus, in Kay and Nils, I had two team-mates I could rely on one hundred percent.”Kay Kaschube: “We did a really good job, but I didn’t find it quite as easy as Laurin. (laughs) As we were in the slowest of the three classes, we had to remain focussed from the first lap to the last, and constantly have an eye on the rear-view mirror. There were a lot of incidents involving cars from faster classes when lapping slower cars. We obviously wanted to avoid that happening to us.” After the first race, what is your impression of the new virtual BMW M4 GT3?Heinrich: “The car is great fun! It is very stable on the brakes, which is where it differs to the BMW Z4 GT3. It is also very reliable and good with the tyres. In my opinion, the feeling you get in the BMW M4 GT3 is almost like the BMW M8 GTE, which I really like.”Nils Koch: “I find the BMW M4 GT3 behaves very neutrally. You feel safe and are subjectively not as close to the limit as you are in the BMW Z4 GT3. That means you can focus even more on setting consistently quick lap times. The tyres held up very well, especially at Daytona. We were able to do three stints on one set of tyres without any issues.”Kaschube: “I noticed that the set-up window for the BMW M4 GT3 has grown significantly. You now have far more set-up variants which you can test.” What does it mean to you to be an official BMW Motorsport SIM Racing team?Koch: “We are proud to race as an official BMW team, as we did recently at the Daytona 24 Hours, one of the biggest highlights on the iRacing calendar. To have then gone on and won the race is obviously a fantastic story.”Heinrich: “That’s true. During the race you always do your best – nothing has changed there. However, the feeling you get from representing a manufacturer like BMW in a really big race is awesome.”Kaschube: “Perhaps a word on our BMW partner teams: We often come up against them, particularly Team Redline and Williams Esports on iRacing. It goes without saying that we are rivals and want to win out there on the track, but I already get the feeling that there is a good team spirit developing among the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams. I am very excited to see how things proceed.” BMW M4 GT3 Fanatec steering wheel.BMW Motorsport SIM Racing presented a spectacular world premiere at its digital BMW SIM Live event last September, which takes the transfer of technology between real and virtual racing to a totally new level: the BMW M4 GT3 steering wheel developed in cooperation with sim racing hardware company Fanatec. It’s the first of its kind to work in both a race car and a race simulator. While the steering wheel is constantly used and optimized in all tests with the real BMW M4 GT3 race car, it will go on sale to sim racers in the second quarter of 2021. Parallel to the start of distribution through Fanatec, a documentary film will also be produced about the development of the hybrid steering wheel, which combines the two worlds of real and digital racing. We will give you more details in a future edition of the BMW SIM News. \n"}

New year, new challenges: BMW Junior Team is continuing its training in 2021 and, after successful outings in the BMW M240i Racing and the BMW M4 GT4, is now stepping up into the GT3 class. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) will contest the full race season on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), including the 24-hour race, in the BMW M6 GT3. The car will be run by BMW Team RMG which, after years of success in the DTM, now flies the flag for BMW Motorsport in GT racing. This year begins just as the last one did for the BMW Junior Team - with a mental and fitness training camp at Formula Medicine. This week, Harper, Hesse and Verhagen travel to Viareggio (ITA), in compliance with all valid pandemic regulations, where they will spend roughly ten weeks improving their physical and mental performance. The Juniors will build on the knowledge they acquired during their stay at Formula Medicine in 2020. Exactly one year ago, we started from scratch with our specific training for the three Juniors. It is different this time, as we are already starting from a very good basis,” said Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli, head of Formula Medicine and mentor to the BMW Junior Team. “Our goal for the next stage of the training is to achieve the same level as we did at our last camp, both physically and mentally, as we return from the winter break. That should not take long at all. We will then go further in the second step. In dialogue with the Juniors, we will use the racing experience from last season to analyse any possible weaknesses, and then work on them individually. This is particularly important, as any weaknesses have a far greater effect in a GT3 car than they would in less powerful cars. In a third step, we will introduce a newly-developed combined training, which will primarily promote mental strength under great physical strain. We call it psycho-physical training.” As well as to increase physical and mental performance, the goal of the whole camp is to generate as detailed data as possible, which the Juniors can use to train over the course of the season – either personally, or on a new online platform, which is currently in its test phase. After the training camp and a planned visit to BMW Motorsport in Munich (GER), BMW Junior Team will return home to the Nürburgring at the end of March to contest the start of the season in the Nürburgring Endurance Series. The first race with the BMW M6 GT3 on the Nordschleife is scheduled for 27th March. The exact programme will depend on how the pandemic develops. BMW Team RMG accompanies BMW Junior Team.One thing is certain - BMW Team RMG will run the BMW M6 GT3 for the BMW Junior Team. Team principal Stefan Reinhold’s outfit enjoyed great success with BMW during its nine years in the DTM, during which time it won the Team competition once and the Drivers’ Championship twice. The team from Andernach (GER) will now drive the development of the BMW M4 GT3 as it enters its final phase, and will also accompany BMW Junior Team on the next level of its training. As well as looking after the BMW M6 GT3 technically at all NLS races, the Nürburgring 24 Hours and the qualification race, another focus is on the operational collaboration between the Juniors and the engineers. The programme includes intensive briefings and debriefings for all races, including data analysis, at the team headquarters in Andernach. “Working with young drivers is always very interesting and the Juniors proved last year already, that they are very professional,” said Reinhold. “I am confident that we will benefit greatly from each other. We can help them with our experience and expertise, just as they can help us by bringing new perspectives to the team. Our approach has not changed. As we did in the DTM, we want to show the greatest degree of professionalism to get the maximum potential from the drivers and the cars. For this reason, regular meetings here in Andernach, both before and after the races, will become the normal routine for the Juniors. Fortunately, nowhere is too far away in the Eifel region.” Reinhold and BMW Team RMG are delighted to be working together with BMW Motorsport in GT racing. “It is something I’ve always wanted to do, because I come from a GT background and the Nürburgring. In recent years, however, it has never been possible to put together such a programme parallel to the DTM, for scheduling reasons. Our tasks for 2021 are very diverse, with the BMW Junior Team races and the development work on the BMW M4 GT3, and are really motivating the whole team.” Great anticipation among Harper, Hesse and Verhagen.As well as the races, Harper, Hesse and Verhagen will also familiarise themselves with other aspects of BMW and motorsport over the course of the year. These include internships and workshops. As in their first year of training, sim racing and social media will continue to play important roles. Exact details will be revealed at a later date. “It was nice to have a few months off, but I am now really looking forward to seeing Max and Neil again, and to starting our pre-season preparations with them at Formula Medicine. We had a great time there last year,” said Harper. Hesse adds, “All our preparations are aimed at enjoying a similar level of success at the racetrack to that of 2020. This includes the hard work at Formula Medicine and learning the BMW M6 GT3 manual, so that we are already very familiar with all the functions before the first test. It is fantastic to be working with a team like RMG, with all its DTM experience, during the season. I am sure that we can learn a lot from the way they work, just as we did from the other teams who looked after our race outings in 2020. It is also fantastic that the team headquarters are so close to the Nürburgring.” Verhagen is also excited about the new season: “The step up to the BMW M6 GT3 will undoubtedly be a big challenge for us, as it means we will be racing against the best GT drivers in the world. However, when it comes to improving our skills so that we can enjoy success again this season, we are in safe hands at BMW Team RMG. I cannot wait to finally get started.”\n"}

One of the highlights of the coming sim racing season is the debut of the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams. BS+COMPETITION, G2 Esports, Team Redline and Williams Esports are among the best teams on the sim racing scene and will regularly compete in virtual BMW race cars in selected race series and at special events for the first time in 2021. In January, all four BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams will take to the track for their first big races of the year. This weekend, three of the teams go head to head for the first time. One Esports project that worked out so well last year that it has been expanded to sim racing this season. Under the maxim ‘United in Rivalry’, G2 Esports has been supported by BMW in ‘League of Legends’ since in 2020, and has established itself as one of the very best teams. G2 Esports is also a top team on the sim racing scene – particularly on the Assetto Corsa Competizione simulation platform. G2 Esports made its debut as one of the four BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams on 9th January when drivers Nils Naujoks and Arthur Kammerer (both GER) competed in the SimGrid Endurance Cup in a virtual BMW M6 GT3. However, they missed out on a top-ten result after a technical issue within the simulation. The race series also includes rounds at Paul Ricard in February and Silverstone in March. “BMW has been a partner of G2 Esports for over a year, and we could not be prouder or happier to now extend this partnership into the world of motor racing,” said G2 Esports CEO Carlos ‘Ocelote’ Rodriguez. “Thanks to the longstanding commitment of Danny Engels and Nils Naujoks, G2 Esports has established itself as a big name in sim racing.” BS+COMPETITION and BMW Team GB compete in the BMW M4 GT3.Last Saturday, BS+COMPETITION and BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Team GB were in action for the first time. They are among the dominant teams in the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series (DNLS). They have previously challenged for race wins and titles in the BMW Z4 GT3 on the virtual Nordschleife, but last Saturday saw them enter uncharted territory with BMW Motorsport and the entire sim racing community on the iRacing platform. They were among the first to go racing in the new BMW M4 GT3. Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Kay Kaschube (GER) were at the wheel for BS+COMPETITION. BMW Team GB, run by Williams Esports, lined up for the 3-hour race with BMW works driver Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Alessandro Bico (ITA). The two teams finished third and fourth in a top-four lock-out for the virtual BMW M4 GT3. “We raced in virtual BMWs last year, but to now be an official BMW Motorsport SIM Racing team makes us all very proud,” said Spengler, who is both a BMW works driver in the world of real racing, and also team captain of BS+COMPETITION in sim racing. “We have a great mix of real racing drivers, who are also extremely quick in the racing simulator, and some of the best sim racers in the world. This year will be a challenge that we are all very much looking forward to.” Team Redline and Williams Esports in action in GT racing and Formula E.The first joint outing of BMW Motorsport and Team Redline will be the first iRacing Special of the year on 23rd\/24th January for the 24 Hours of Daytona. BS+COMPETITION and BMW Team GB will also run cars in this race, meaning the three BMW Motorsport SIM Racing teams will go head to head for the first time. Team Redline and BMW Team GB are back in action just one week later, when they race with the BMW iFE.21 in the virtual version of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship named ‘Formula E: Accelerate’. The series comprises six events between January and March, each on a Thursday. “We are extremely excited about the coming year. We believe we are a very good match for BMW, with its motorsport history and vision of the future for sim racing,” said Dom Duhan, founder and head of Team Redline. “New challenges and more top-level competitions await us in 2021. Our collaboration with BMW will hopefully give us the opportunity to enjoy great success at many different events.\n"}

Proven riders and an experienced newcomer sums up the rider line-up for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team for the 2021 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC). Markus Reiterberger (GER) and Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) will race for team manager Werner Daemen’s BMW works team once again this season. New to the team as the third regular rider on the number 37 bike is Spain’s Javier ‘Xavi’ Forés. Kenny Foray (FRA) also remains on board and will support the team as a reserve rider going forward. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team contested the FIM EWC for the first time in the 2019\/20 season, with Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Foray as regular riders. The team established itself among the frontrunners right away. In four of the races that took place, the team finished on the podium twice and was involved in the battle for the title down to the season finale. New addition Forés is best-known from the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). He made his debut in the series in 2011 – representing the former BMW Motorrad Italia SBK Team. Forés won the title in the European Stock 1000 Championship in 2013, and in the International German Motorcycle Championship (IDM) a year later. From 2016 to 2018 and in 2020 he was a regular rider in WorldSBK, stepping onto the podium on five occasions. He took a year out in 2019 to contest a season in the British Superbike Championship (BSB). The 35-year-old returns to this series this year, and will represent FHO Racing BMW British Superbike Team (formerly Smiths Racing Team). Forés also has experience of the FIM EWC. The 2021 season of the FIM EWC consists of five events and gets underway on 17th\/18th April with the 24-hour race at Le Mans (FRA). BMW’s home race is scheduled for 23rd May, with the 8-hour race at Oschersleben (GER). The season continues on 18th July with the 8-hour race at Suzuka (JPN). The legendary 24-hour Bol d’Or will take place at Le Castellet (FRA) on 18th and 19th September, before Estoril in Portugal once again hosts the season finale with the 12-hour race on 16th October. Ahead of the season, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team will complete several tests. Quotes. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We are in a superb position for the coming season of the FIM EWC with this line-up. With Markus and Ilya, as well as Kenny as reserve rider, we are continuing the path we set out on successfully last season. They are a well-oiled team along with the engineers, technicians and mechanics, and this continuity is incredibly important. In addition, as a new regular rider, Xavi has a huge wealth of international experience and his personality is a great fit for our team. We’re delighted to welcome him to the BMW family and are confident that he will be the perfect reinforcement for our endurance works team. Preparations for the new season are in full swing and we will soon be taking to the track for the first test rides. We are eager to build on our strong rookie season and consistently be among the world elite in 2021.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I think that we have the current best riders on board in endurance. We started last season for the first time with a new team and already had really incredible riders. This year, we additionally welcome Xavi Forés who is one of the best sprint racing riders in the world and I think that now with Ilya, Markus and Xavi we can say that we have the best three riders in the FIM EWC. I think that we are now ready to hopefully jump on the podium in every race and at the end of the season we aim to be at the top of the championship. I am really proud of all the four guys we have now in our line-up because with Kenny I know we have one of the best spare riders.” Markus Reiterberger: “I’m really looking forward to working with Xavi Forés. He gives us another very strong rider at our side, ready to take the next step to the very top. I’m looking forward to a fantastic season, which gets underway soon with the initial test rides. Our tyre partner Dunlop has given it their all to ensure we are well-equipped for the season. I was closely involved in the development and I think that we have found a few things that will help us this season. I’m really looking forward to representing Werner’s team and BMW again in the FIM EWC, and I think that we have an awesome package with a really good team. We are at a very high level with our rider line-up. With two former WorldSBK riders and three IDM title winners we have the best qualifications for success. I’m looking forward to getting started with Xavi, Ilya and the team.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “Finally, the countdown is on to the first tests and the start of the new season. It’s a really good feeling and I have prepared myself intensively, like always, training every day to stay as strong and fit as possible. With my experience from last year I hope to further improve on the track. In Markus and Xavi, I have two great team-mates, fast guys on the track and great people. I am really looking forward to working with the team again. We will try to fight again at a very high level and for the top positions and use all our experiences to claim even better results. And apart from that, we will enjoy the racing very much.” Javier Forés: “I am really excited to be part of the BMW works team in the FIM Endurance World Championship, especially because I already know some of the people inside the team from the past when I was riding in the IDM. I have always had a very good relationship with Markus Reiterberger and Werner Daemen in particular so it’s going to be nice to work with them. It’s a strong project and I am sure that we are going to fight for the title this season. That has to be the target because I feel that we have the potential and as riders, with Markus and Ilya, we can add to a very strong package. So I am really happy and especially really looking forward to starting testing in order to prepare for the first race, the 24 hours of Le Mans.”\n"}

In each of the first four events, the teams finishing in the top three will share a total prize fund of 4,200 US dollars. In the fifth race it is all about further starting places for BMW SIM Live. Then, in Season 2, the new BMW M4 GT3 will take over from the BMW M8 GTE as the car for the races that run for 120 minutes each. The BMW SIM GT Cup is an exciting experience in itself for the world’s best sim racers, which without a doubt includes Australia’s Joshua Rogers. He won the end-of-year final of the BMW SIM 120 Cup in 2020, which saw him claim a cash prize of 12,000 US dollars. He fought off Maximilian Benecke (GER) and Graham Carroll (GBR) in an exciting race in December. Now, Rogers will be part of the action once again when the new season gets underway at Daytona on Sunday. Three questions for … Joshua Rogers. Joshua, what are your memories of BMW SIM Live 2020 and your victory at the BMW SIM 120 Cup final? Joshua Rogers: “BMW did a fantastic job with the virtual BMW SIM Live event. It ended up being very different than planned but the production of the stream instead of a live event in Munich was fantastic and the race itself was a great platform for sim racing. The format was very compact, and the competition was top-class. The BMW SIM Cup draws the big names involved in iRacing. That is because we are all eager to go head to head at a world-class level as often as we can. That usually means spectacular races, which the final in December definitely was. That meant I was even more delighted with my win.” Now the new season is about to start – in the BMW M8 GTE once again. What are your thoughts on the car and the Daytona track? Rogers: “I really enjoy racing in the BMW M8 GTE. I have gained a lot of experience in the car and have good memories of a few big wins. The BMW M8 GTE suits the way I drive I think, since I like front-engined cars. If I could choose any car to contest a race with, I think I would probably choose the BMW M8 GTE. It’s a lot of fun. And in terms of the Daytona track – it’s a tricky one. The track always makes for fantastic racing for spectators, but it’s not necessarily the fastest driver who wins there. Factors such as slipstream, fuel strategy and tyre strategy play huge roles. As a driver it’s about always being in the right place at the right time. No doubt it will be spectacular – interesting, but for us drivers it will also be a bit stressful due to the many variables. But I’m looking forward to it all the same.” How excited are you for the BMW M4 GT3, which will be in action for the first time in Season 2 of the BMW SIM GT Cup in the second half of the year? Rogers: “Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to test the car yet, but I have heard from colleagues that it is very good on fast tracks in particular. I’ll definitely see what the BMW M4 GT3 is like for myself as soon as I get the chance. I really enjoy driving GT3 cars with their driving aids such as ABS or traction control. It’s a little different than in the BMW M8 GTE, for example, but is just as much fun. But before that, let’s make sure that Season 1 goes well and hopefully we will bring home good results.” BMW SIM GT Cup race calendar, Season 1:17th January: Daytona7th March: Suzuka21st March: Silverstone2nd May: Road Atlanta16th May: Nürburgring (Season 1 final)\n"}
{"prompt":"Snow is guaranteed on a winter road trip through northern Finland. With a bit of luck, you can see the aurora borealis in the night-time sky. During the day, the endlessly long country roads, generally without any trace of human beings, are an ideal place to test the performance attributes of the all-wheel drive extreme athlete from the British brand while following in the tracks of the legendary “Flying Finns”.   ->","completion":" Munich. There must be something about the training conditions of their Finnish homeland to have spawned two of the best drivers who ever took the wheel on the rally tracks of this world. Timo Mäkinen and Rauno Aaltonen from Finland acquired the sensitive touch in their hands and feet driving on deserted roads through Lapland that were usually already covered in snow by late autumn, and sometimes also on frozen lakes. Later on, the rally drivers were to benefit from this experience when they were battling in a fight for seconds during rally competitions. MINI has particularly special associations with the two “Flying Finns”. In 1965 and 1967 respectively, Mäkinen and Aaltonen won the second and third overall victory driving the classic MINI Cooper S in the Monte Carlo Rally.Right from the start, you can sense that sporty driving in Lapland requires a special skill set, even when travelling on a winter road trip in a modern model of the British premium brand like the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman . The power of 225 kW\/306 hp under the engine bonnet demands sensitive use of the accelerator pedal, while the ALL4 all-wheel drive takes over high-precision distribution of the beefy drive torque between the front and rear wheels. And if high spirits take over, there’s always Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) to calm things down.Power at this level, four driven wheels and electronic assistants were not yet available in the golden age of Mäkinen and Aaltonen. They accomplished their spectacular driving manoeuvres with much more modest means. In 2010, they were the first drivers to be honoured in the newly established “Rally Hall of Fame” – together with Paddy Hopkirk from Northern Ireland, who had already captured the first “Monte” overall win driving the classic Mini in 1964. It’s unlikely to be a coincidence that the Rally Hall of Fame is actually located in Finland. The greats in this discipline are saluted at the Mobilia automobile museum in Tampere. Over the years, numerous other rally drivers from the Land of a Thousand Lakes have earned the epithet of “Flying Finn”. No fewer than eleven of the current 26 members of the “Rally Hall of Fame” are Finns. A visit to the museum therefore forms the ideal launchpad for a road trip in the tracks of the rallying legends. The anticipation grows spontaneously at the prospect of testing the performance attributes of the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman on ice and snow.Anybody setting off from Tampere to Lapland has the option of travelling north for hundreds of kilometres along the western coast of Finland so that they can gradually acclimatise to the region’s arctic temperatures. In Lapland, winter manifests itself in its pure form: bone-chillingly cold and with lots of snow. It’s important to be well wrapped up in warm clothing. The MINI John Cooper Works Clubman offers generous space for the appropriate apparel in its baggage compartment of 360 litres behind the twin hinged barn-door style rear doors. After folding down the rear-seat backrest, the volume of stowage space even increases to 1 250 litres. And additional space is available in the MINI roof box to accommodate windcheater jackets, skiing underwear and woollen socks. It offers capacity of 320 litres and can be securely fixed to the optional roof rails of the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman and to the carrier supplied in the MINI Original accessories range in few simple steps.After a stopover in Lapland’s capital city of Rovaniemi, it’s just a short trip to cross the Arctic Circle in the north. The vastness of the landscape is an invitation to simply follow the road on a journey through dense pine forests and past numerous lakes. The MINI John Cooper Works Clubman ploughs imperturbably through deep snow. Far away from stop signs and traffic lights, icy surfaces present an open invitation to refine the art of drifting round bends.The region of Lapland extends over the entire north of the countries of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia. It encompasses the settlement area of the Sámi indigenous people, whose culture and history are documented in a museum in the village of Inari. Anybody who has made it this far, may well be thinking about continuing their journey up to the North Cape on the Norwegian island of Magerøya. After all, it’s only another 400 kilometres of driving.Lots of places in Lapland offer the opportunity of going on a snowshoe hiking tour or a ride in a dog sleigh to discover Arctic foxes, snowy owls and other animals in their natural environment. Moreover, tourists from all over the world are attracted to the far north to get a glimpse of the northern lights during a long winter night. You have to be quick when the temperatures and visibility conditions are just right for this natural phenomenon in order to get to a good viewing point at the right time. The MINI John Cooper Works Clubman doesn’t disappoint and this additional trip provides yet another treat. During the night-time “sleigh ride” with 306 horsepower, the optional adaptive LED headlamps with matrix function for high beam illuminate the route leading to one of the viewing points that offer a particularly good view of the brightly coloured and spectacular heavenly display.Ranua Wildlife Park provides a stunning introduction to the animal world of the Arctic. It is located on the outskirts of the little town of Ranua approximately 80 kilometres south of Rovaniemi, and visitors to the zoo get an opportunity to see at close quarters elk, reindeer, brown bears and polar bears, wolves, arctic foxes and lots of other animals that are indigenous to northern Scandinavia. Wooden tracks and bridges wend their way past the spacious enclosures. Ranua Wildlife Park was opened in 1983 and is the most popular tourist attraction in the north of Finland.Apartment houses and Arctic Fox Igloos provide accommodation for a longer stay at the Wildlife Park. These amenities are located directly on the banks of Lake Ranuanjärvi. They have their own sauna and a bedroom with panoramic viewing window looking north to provide an outstanding vantage point. There’s virtually nowhere else in Lapland where you can view the famous polar lights in a more comfortable or warmer environment.\n"}

With Christmas approaching rapidly, BMW Junior Team can look back on an eventful first year of training. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) have overcome the challenges thrown up by the pandemic, which could not have been foreseen at the start of the year, have grown together as a team, and have achieved great sporting success. What started with a training camp with Formula Medicine in January reached its high point with class victory in the BMW M4 GT4 at the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER). BMW Junior Team and its mentor Jochen Neerpasch are now looking forward to stepping up to the BMW M6 GT3 next season. More than 40 years after the first generation in 1977, the iconic BMW Junior Team made its comeback in 2020. As it was back then, the goal this time was to bring three young drivers together to form a strong team, which would cause a stir out on the track. Back in the fold, as he was in 1977, is Jochen Neerpasch. The founder of the original BMW Junior Team has followed the development of Harper, Hesse and Verhagen very closely in recent months – despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which posed a major challenge for the programme organisers. The fact that BMW Junior Team’s first year was still a huge success is something that Neerpasch believes should not be taken for granted: “Firstly, a big compliment and thank you goes to everyone who was involved in organising the programme. Against the background of the pandemic, it was far from easy to implement the plan that we had developed for BMW Junior Team at the start of the year. It is only thanks to commitment and very good collaboration within the whole team that we still managed to pull it off.” Dirk Adorf also made a major contribution to this success. Like Neerpasch, he was always on hand to provide mentoring support and advice for the three Juniors. From a sporting point of view, Neerpasch gave BMW Junior Team a very good report. “Despite the challenging conditions, BMW Junior Team performed very well and fully met all our expectations. It was important to see how excellently the team worked together and consistently improved their sporting performances. You could say that they passed their examination with the class victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours.” The highlight – class victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours.BMW Junior Team passed its ‘exam’ with victory in the BMW M4 GT4 in the SP8T class at the endurance classic at the end of September – the highlight of the first year of training, which had started with a two-month fitness and mental training camp at Formula Medicine in Viareggio (ITA). That is where the foundations were laid for a successful season of racing. “At the start of the year, I did not know what would await me, as it was the first time I had moved away from home. However, we got on well from day one and were on the same wavelength as a team,” said Harper, summing up the time spent in Tuscany. The trio should actually have moved straight into a shared house at the Nürburgring immediately after the camp, but that was postponed to June due to the pandemic. “It was obviously a shame that we were not able to go racing straight after our fitness camp due to the pandemic,” said Harper. “However, we did a lot of sim racing during that time, which was great fun.” Back in January, BMW Motorsport offered BMW Junior Team the opportunity to visit the 24-hour race at Daytona (USA) and to experience at first hand what it means to contest an endurance race with BMW. That was very good preparation for their first race outing, which came with the start of the season in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) at the end of June. BMW Junior Team adapted very quickly to the specific challenges posed to racing drivers by the ‘Green Hell’. In only their third race of the season, Harper and Verhagen took class victory in the BMW M240i Racing. Next was a first outing in the BMW M4 GT4, in which BMW Junior Team continued to learn quickly and ultimately finished 19th overall, first in their class, and as the best-placed non-GT3 car at the 24-hour race – all despite miserable weather conditions, which even caused the organisers to suspend racing during the night. “The weather conditions at the 24-hour race were probably the craziest I have ever experienced,” said Harper. “The fact that we eventually won our class in commanding fashion is something my team-mates and I, and the entire team, are very proud of.” A team – both on and off the track.Verhagen also looks back very positively on the season. “A big thank you goes to everyone who supported us so well this year and made it something very special. It really was fantastic. I am very happy that we achieved everything we wanted to achieve in our first year. When you consider how challenging the pandemic made this year, our programme actually went remarkably well.” As well as the sporting success, Hesse is also keen to emphasise the importance for his personal development. “The year was very intensive and interesting. Personally, I have learned an incredible amount and we have developed hugely as a team. Living together with Dan and Neil on a daily basis has really helped me develop, both as a racing driver and a person. I am very grateful for that.” BMW Junior Team also placed great emphasis on the importance of not only racing together in the same car, but also developing a real team spirit and working as one unit. “I had very high expectations, especially when it comes to teamwork, but the Juniors actually exceeded them,” said Neerpasch. “They communicate very well with each other, and support one another superbly. That should not be taken for granted and, to be honest, we have been a little fortunate that it has worked out so well.” As well as living together in one house, joint activities such as track days with BMW Esports team FNATIC and Marc Surer, a member of the very first BMW Junior Team, in vintage and modern-day race cars also contributed to the good team spirit. To give BMW Junior Team something to think about other than motor racing and training, the trio received a visit from TikTok and Instagram stars Sky&Tami. Step up to the BMW M6 GT3 in year two.Harper, Hesse and Verhagen will spend New Year at home with their families. However, the next challenges are just around the corner. As soon as the pandemic allows it, the BMW Junior Team will return to Formula Medicine to prepare for the racing season. Once that starts, the Juniors will move back into their shared house at the Nürburgring. However, the plan is also for the trio to spend more time near the BMW Motorsport base in Munich (GER) in its second year of training. At the racetrack, BMW Junior Team is set to take the step up to the BMW M6 GT3. From the opening race of the NLS season, Harper, Hesse and Verhagen will go head to head with the best GT drivers on the Nordschleife in the top class. “I am really looking forward to racing against the ‘big boys’ in the same class,” said Hesse. “In my opinion, the most important thing in our first year was to prepare as well as possible for what awaits us in 2021 with the switch to a GT3 car. I think we have done a really good job.” Verhagen sees the situation similarly. “Hopefully we can have some success again in the BMW M6 GT3 next year. I can hardly wait to get going again.” When the time comes, Neerpasch will be there again, keeping a close eye on whether BMW Junior Team can continue its positive development. He believes they can now expect another aspect of the training – something that did not play such a major role in the first year – pressure to perform. However, “Based on what they have achieved this year, I am confident that they will manage the switch to the BMW M6 GT3 and pass their masters’ examination at next year’s 24-hour race.”\n"}
{"prompt":"The four wind turbines on the grounds of BMW Group Plant Leipzig have been generating green energy for BMW i production since 2013. But this Advent they have a second job as well: as symbols for Advent candles lighting the way to sustainability.  ->","completion":" Leipzig. The four wind turbines on the grounds of BMW Group Plant Leipzig have been generating green wind energy for BMW i production since 2013. In fact, the BMW Group has been manufacturing its first fully electric model with locally generated green energy since day one. At 190 metres high and with nominal power of 2.5 megawatts each, the turbines generated a combined total of 26.4 gigawatt hours of electricity purely from wind in 2019 – enough to power more than 5,000 three-person households for a year.This Advent the four wind turbines have another very special job on the side, as Advent candles. Each Advent Sunday, one more is lit up in bright white rather than the usual blue, until the Fourth Sunday of Advent, when all of them will be aglow. Each ‘candle’ is evenly illuminated by the eight powerful LED lights that surround it and are powered by electricity from the turbines themselves.The wind turbines provide about one fifth of all the electricity used at BMW Group Plant Leipzig. When production is not running, they power other areas of the facility and ensure the base load is covered. In addition, they feed energy into the BMW Battery Farm, which is also located on-site at Plant Leipzig. The battery farm comprises up to 700 interconnected high-voltage BMW i3 batteries and has been in operation since 2017. In combination with the turbines, it connects the plant’s own renewable energy generation with a local energy storage facility and a major industrial consumer. Being integrated into the public grid as well, the battery farm helps to reduce the load on the network and contributes additional power.The wind turbines at BMW Group Plant Leipzig are a highly visible symbol of the company’s commitment to sustainability – a commitment the BMW Group sees very much as a part of its identity. Production at Plant Leipzig has been powered exclusively with carbon-neutral energy since 2018. All of the energy supplied by providers comes from renewable sources.\n"}
{"prompt":"What might conceivably be a good early Christmas present for a world-famous rallying legend at the end of a year dominated by lockdown? The penny dropped at MINI: Rauno Aaltonen, winner of the Monte Carlo Rally in 1967 in a classic Mini, was greeted with a yuletide surprise on four wheels in his Finnish homeland.   ->","completion":" Munich. He is known the world over as the Rally Professor, but too much theory puts a damper on the mood of even the most ardent specialist at some point. Owing to the lockdown regulations, Rauno Aaltonen had to stay at home in Finland over the past eight months. No outings onto the rally track, no tests of strength in historic competitions, no practice training sessions instructing young learners with a passion for motor sport. Meanwhile, Aaltonen is 82 years old but the itch to floor the pedal has never really gone away. And his astonishing level of fitness still allows him to be a potent force behind the steering wheel. Never before had he been forced to do without driving a car for such a long time as during the pandemic year of 2020. And, no, he really isn’t cut out for retirement.What a good thing that there are some true friends out there who know exactly how to get on top of boredom. Even before the first door was opened in the advent calendar, the people at MINI had a brilliant idea for an advent gift of a very special kind. And because it was crystal clear what the seasoned rally driver and long-term companion of the British brand is currently lacking most, there was no point in sending a beribboned package. A motorised “sleigh” on wheels was dispatched northwards. An enclosed vehicle trailer loaded with a classic Mini and towed by a MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 embarked on the long journey to northern climes.“Over a period of nearly 60 years, Rauno has given us so many magic moments. Now is the perfect moment to give something back,” said Bernd Körber, Head of MINI. In fact, the relationship between Aaltonen and the British brand goes all the way back to 1961. At the time, the driver from Finland had just ascended to Rally Champion in his homeland and he was dead set on taking up the challenge of competing for the first time in what was even then the mythologised “Monte” at the beginning of the following year. He found absolutely the right vehicle in the classic Mini. The joint premiere came to an end with a spectacular crash, but already in January 1963, Aaltonen driving the Mini Cooper completed the Monte Carlo Rally as class winner and third in the overall placings driving.From one year to the next, the classic Mini and the works team got better and better at making preparations to match the unique conditions of the Monte Carlo Rally – not least owing to the precise instructions given to the team by Rauno Aaltonen after each race and for each test drive. He provided meticulous details relating to vehicle tuning, additional equipment, conditions of the road and tyre selection. “Everything allowed by the regulations that was feasible was implemented,” he was to report later on.Nevertheless, the crowning glory of his ambition initially went to other drivers. In 1964, “Paddy” Hopkirk from Northern Ireland took the first overall victory driving the Mini Cooper S. In the subsequent year, Aaltonen’s fellow countryman Timo Mäkinen matched his success. In 1966, “the three musketeers”, as the trio became known, even took first, second and third place, but the Mini was disqualified by the race stewards, who issued the controversial decision that the Mini’s lights breached the regulations. But 1967 at last proved to be his year: Rauno Aaltonen drove to his well-earned overall victory at the Monte Carlo Rally.His feat finally transformed the Mini into a rally legend and stamped its imprint on the entire sport into the bargain. Aaltonen is regarded as the inventor of braking on the left, which enabled him to keep his right foot on the pedal while the left foot switched between the clutch and the brake pedal. “Piano playing with your feet” was his name for it. The Finn also made copious notes about the route and was the first to send out “ice spies” onto the course to make notes and drawings about the condition of the road. His meticulous preparations and his ability to give a clear explanation of his rapid driving manoeuvres soon also helped Aaltonen’s career away from rally tracks. As the first chief instructor at BMW Driver Training founded in 1976, today familiar as BMW and MINI Driving Experience, the “Rally Professor” passed on his knowledge about fast and safe driving to numerous participants taking part in the training sessions.The 1960s were a “golden” era for the classic Mini, when the Monte Carlo Rally used to start off as a star rally beginning in a number of different European cities. Even the trip to the first regularity stage was often an adventurous drive. In light of this knowledge, it became a matter of honour for the MINI Team to take on a veritable marathon as a tribute to Rauno Aaltonen. The road trip with the trailer towed by the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 started out from Munich and initially headed straight for the Baltic. After a ferry trip lasting around 30 hours, the combination of MINI and trailer continued on another road trip lasting 14 hours along Finland’s roads, some of them already covered in wintry snow.The destination for the advent mission was Rovaniemi – the main city in the Lapland region, known the world over as the “official residence of Santa Claus”. But the MINI Team hadn’t brought a wish list with them. Instead, they had taken along an advent gift to hand over. They presented the offering with warmest season’s greetings from Munich, socially distanced of course, and the transporter opened up as if by magic. The trailer was decorated with a picture of a classic Mini, leaving no doubt about its content, but Rauno Aaltonen was visibly moved when the red classic car with the white roof rolled out.However, he didn’t lose much time. A little while later, high arcs of snow flew in all directions and the old master sped off, drifting as he went, on an extensive tour through snowy Finnish forests. There’s no question about it: Rauno Altonen couldn’t have had a better advent present. Finally, the enforced break had come to an end and at last he could “play the piano again with his feet”. On his way to the Arctic Circle, he will undoubtedly have been singing his own version of a well-known Christmas song. Instead of “Driving Home for Christmas” he was probably singing “Driving at Home before Christmas”. \n"}

{"prompt":"Anybody wanting to create a festive atmosphere in their homely living room, first needs to venture out into nature. They have to be really determined to bring the most beautiful fir tree of all back home. With this end in mind, even an extended road trip is worthwhile – all the more so if the versatile allrounder from the British premium brand promises to transform the journey through snowy landscapes into wintry fun.  ->","completion":" Munich. The expectations are high, the mission is clearly defined, and a glance at the calendar shows there’s no time to delay. As we draw closer to the yuletide season, the search for the perfect Christmas tree becomes the most important mission of the year – well, at any rate for the month of December. Not too big, but there again not too small, a straight trunk and evenly configured branches of a uniformly deep green. This is what the traditional fir tree should look like, decorated with lights and baubles to conjure up a festive mood in the living room back home. In other words, you need to be picky when you’re making a decision about the right Christmas tree. And anybody who entrusts this mission to husbands, partners or fathers generally suspects that the search for an iconic symbol of a peaceful Christmas celebration is inevitably going to be rather a protracted affair.As far as Jürgen Metz from Munich is concerned, the search for a tree takes off directly after breakfast has finished with a selection of the appropriate means of transport. A classic Innocenti Mini is ready to go. He has already been on some awesome road trips in the lovingly cherished Italo-British runabout. But today, the member of the personnel working in dynamic driving development at MINI has something rather bigger in mind. The new MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 is the obvious choice with its optional roof bars and carriers supplied in the MINI Original accessories range. It’s ready to be transformed into an Xmas Tree Express. And in principle, procurement could undoubtedly be dealt with quite swiftly. It’s true that all types and sizes of tree are available in the car park in front of the local supermarket. But are they really fresh? And isn’t it just much too risky to purchase an off-the-peg fir tree that’s already shrouded in netting ready for transportation?It’s true that the selection is even greater in front of the DIY store on the edge of town. But word has clearly got around. Hordes of prospective customers are standing in front of the fenced-in open-air market and waiting to be let into the “forest” of fir trees arrayed in serried ranks and sorted according to size. Surveying the scene gives Jürgen food for thought. Wouldn’t it be a lot more festive to go on a more traditional search and look for the perfect tree far from the madding crowd in the midst of pristine nature? In the hilly Eifel region where he grew up this was always the only proper way to get in the Christmassy mood. And even today, a fir tree cut down by hand is still regarded as the optimum signal for the start of the festive season.The navigation system of the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 lists almost a dozen locations in the Munich area for “Cut your own Christmas tree”. Tactical thinking is therefore necessary when it comes to selecting the destination. Jürgen calculates that the best choice will be where there’s not a mad rush of big-city dwellers. He quickly decides to head for a forests of conifers located to the south of the city. Combining the purchase of a Christmas tree with an outing into the snowy mountain landscape is extremely appealing.Already after a few kilometres of travelling along winding country roads, a new festive spirit takes hold behind the steering wheel of the new MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4. The four-cylinder petrol engine packing 131 kW\/178 hp and augmented by MINI TwinPower Turbo technology bears testimony to its athletic temperament with each burst of speed. Lakes Starnberg and Staffelsee are quickly left behind. The Zugspitze – Germany’s highest mountain – is approaching, and driving fun has only just begun. Once he’s in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Jürgen is convinced that the very best Christmas trees of all will be found in Austria. A little later, it's over the border and into Tyrol.More than 25 years ago, a host of forestry owners in this Alpine Austrian state got together to establish the “Tyrolean Christmas Tree” as a brand. Today, the name stands for a seal of quality that guarantees professional cultivation of the trees in a natural environment. Every year, some 30,000 trees from the forests of registered growers ensure a festive glow in living rooms. This is a very good reason to search for the right Christmas tree in Tyrol.However, the stunningly picturesque mountain panorama has meanwhile ensured that the actual reason for the road trip through the Alpine uplands has almost been forgotten. Jürgen is only too well aware that the agility so typical of MINI will come into its own when cornering on hairpin bends at the wheel even of the biggest model from the British premium brand. With every metre scaled by the new MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4, it’s not just the mountains of snow piled up along the sides of the road that grow. Winter driving fun also attains unimagined pinnacles of intensity as the powerful allrounder makes its ascent.Shortly before the road up to the glacier skiing area of Sölden, a road sign once more brings to mind the driver’s original goal for the outing. “Christmas trees directly from the forest” are advertised there. The sign points along a snow-covered woodland track that leads into the depths of the forest. The all-wheel drive system distributes power between the front and rear wheels within the space of a few milliseconds. This meets the driving requirements at any point in time and means that the new MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 is utterly in its element in the wintry landscape. A few minutes later, the pop-up point of sale has been reached – behind it, there are fir trees stretching as far as the eye can see, all waiting to become the illuminated centrepiece in a festively decorated living room. Surely it must be possible to find the perfect Christmas tree here.Awesome: In the Christmas tree plantation on the edge of the forest located in the Ötztal Alps, virtually every fir tree has the right dimensions. After a brief inspection of the shape of the crown and the branch density, the sound of the chain saw shatters the peaceful scene.Shortly after that, Jürgen has loaded the tree onto the roof carrier of the MINI Countryman. “That went really fast,” he ruminates with satisfaction, while the descending twilight immediately puts this assessment in perspective. But he’s quite clear about one thing: the long road trip was well worth it, because it simply wouldn’t have been possible to find such a great tree as this one, even with looking all over Munich. The series LED headlamps of the new MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 now show Jürgen the way back to the metalled roads where he quickly selects the fastest route back home in the navigation system. After all, the carefully selected tree is destined to be put up and decorated that very same evening. \n"}

Catsburg and Farfus, who had already triumphed at the 8 Hours of Indianapolis (USA), claimed the drivers’ title in the IGTC. In the #35 BMW M6 GT3, Martin Tomczyk (GER), Nick Yelloly and David Pittard (both GBR) crossed the finish line in sixth position after nine hours. BMW completed the season in second place in the manufacturers’ standings.Starting driver Farfus began the race from third place and was able to defend his position in the early stage before handing over the #34 BMW M6 GT3 to local hero van der Linde. The South African was able to move up one place due to a competitor suffering from technical issues. However, the #34 BMW M6 GT3 then lost three places, reaching the halfway point of the race in fifth position. The trio then managed to battle their way back to third place, before losing a place once again during the penultimate pit stop. One and a half hours before the end of the race, heavy rain moved in over the circuit just outside Johannesburg (RSA). The #34 BMW M6 GT3 was the first car from the leading group to head for the pits and change to wet-weather tyres. Competitors then spun out and made later pit stops as Catsburg moved into the lead around half an hour before the end and he was able to cross the line first under Full Course Yellow conditions.Tomczyk started the race from sixth place in the #35 BMW M6 GT3 and gained two positions on the first lap. He defended fourth place until the first pit stop, when he handed over to Yelloly. The British driver was initially unable to keep up the pace, losing several places before handing over to Pittard in seventh. In the second half of the race, the trio improved by one position to finish in sixth place.The IGTC season 2020: turbulent global tournament with ups and downs for Walkenhorst Motorsport. The Kyalami race marked the end of the second complete season in the Intercontinental GT Challenge for Walkenhorst Motorsport. The season lost one event after the cancellation of the ‘Suzuka 10 Hours’ but still featured four endurance events on four different continents. For the season-opener, Walkenhorst Motorsport headed to Australia, where the team from Melle (GER) competed with one BMW M6 GT3 at the ‘Bathurst 12 Hour’. Farfus, Catsburg and local hero Chaz Mostert (AUS) shared driving duties but were forced to retire from the race early after an unfortunate collision with a kangaroo. Things went much better in the second race – the 8 Hours of Indianapolis (USA). Walkenhorst Motorsport produced the perfect race with the two BMW M6 GT3s on the legendary circuit. Catsburg, Farfus and Connor De Phillippi (USA) triumphed in the #34 BMW M6 GT3, with Pittard, Tomczyk and Yelloly following right behind in the #35 BMW M6 GT3 to confirm the one-two result and start the celebrations. At the third race of the season, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), the team endured bad luck similar to that in Bathurst. At the classic race in the Ardennes, the two BMW M6 GT3s retired after two collisions. However, luck was back on their side at the season finale in Kyalami. Victory for Catsburg and Farfus saw them top the drivers’ championship.Reactions after the race:Niclas Königbauer (Walkenhorst Motorsport Team Manager): “What a race. We proved again how important it is to keep a cool head under crazy conditions and work together closely as a team. I am unbelievably proud of how everyone performed, on and off the track. Everyone did a phenomenal job without mistakes and that’s the key to finish and win a race. For everyone this is a superb finish to the 2020 season which was difficult in many ways. However, having the big trophy at the end gives us all great momentum as we prepare for 2021. Many thanks again to everyone involved in those achievements.”Nick Catsburg (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “Unbelievable. We are the champions in the drivers’ standings. Up to the final two hours of the race, we really did not expect that to happen. We hoped for something crazy to happen. Just like last year, it wouldn't be Kyalami if something mad didn't happen. It was just like that, apart from the fact that there was a restart at the end of the race last year. Congratulations to the team for getting it right. I am delighted to have won the race and the championship. I am a bit sorry for the Honda team. They dominated today and would have earned a good result.”Augusto Farfus (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “I am a bit speechless. It was a difficult year with many challenges on and off the track. I am very glad that BMW and the Walkenhorst Motorsport team stayed strong together. We delivered a very strong campaign. The race today wasn't easy but we executed very well. None of the drivers made any mistakes and the car worked very well. I am very happy with this championship. Let's celebrate!\"Sheldon van der Linde (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “To be honest, it feels like a title today. It is fantastic to drive with these guys. We didn’t make any mistakes and the car was just perfect. At the moment, I am lost for words. We came close last year and this year we managed it. Simply unbelievable.”\n"}

For more than half a century Schnitzer Motorsport and BMW were in action on racetracks of the world together and celebrated superb successes in a variety of categories. This collaboration also played a significant role in shaping the sports performance and momentum of the BMW brand. Now this long, successful shared journey is coming to an end. A review of victories, titles and triumphs from the 1960s to today. The success story of the original racing team founded by Josef and Herbert Schnitzer Senior and managed by his half-brother Karl ‘Charly’ Lamm started in the mid 1960s. Lamm’s twin brother Dieter Lamm was also given an important role; he was responsible for the team’s technical processes and logistics until his death in 2014. In the beginning, Schnitzer Motorsport celebrated titles in the German Circuit Championship and the European Hill Climb Championship with BMW racing cars. In 1975, Jacques Laffite won the Formula 2 European Championship in a formula racing car with a BMW engine. And so it went on: sports cars, touring cars, prototypes, GT racing – the list of triumphs that Schnitzer Motorsport and BMW have celebrated together in international racing is long and impressive. Schnitzer was European touring car champion three times in the 1980s. That was also when the streak of nine wins in the touring car races at the ‘Guia Circuit’ in Macau (MAC) started. Between 1989 and 2010, Schnitzer enjoyed victory at the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring five times and made a significant contribution to BMW being the record winner to date in this endurance classic. The same is true of the 24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), which Schnitzer also won five times starting in 1985. On top of that were the titles with Roberto Ravaglia (ITA) in the World Touring Car Championship in 1987 and in the DTM in 1989, as well as with Joachim Winkelhock (GER \/ 1995) and Johnny Cecotto (ITA \/ 1998) in the German Super Touring Car Championship. Hands down, the major highlights of the partnership also include the overall win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) in 1999 with the legendary BMW V12 LMR. It was with that prototype that Schnitzer also won the 12-hour race at Sebring (USA) in the same year. The team claimed the title in the GT standings of the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) in 2001. Between 2005 and 2009, Schnitzer competed as a BMW works team in the FIA World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) and celebrated a sensational 25 wins as well as a total of 57 podiums. 2012 saw Schnitzer return to the DTM as a works team with BMW – and together they celebrated a triumphant comeback year, with the driver’s title for Bruno Spengler (CAN), the team title for BMW Team Schnitzer and the manufacturer’s title for BMW. BMW Team Schnitzer was active in the DTM until 2016, with a successful record of 25 wins and 88 podiums. In recent years, Schnitzer continued their activities in GT racing, contesting the International GT Challenge (IGTC) among other series. The win with Augusto Farfus (BRA) at the GT World Cup in Macau is unforgettable. It was Charly Lamm’s final race as team principal before he handed over management of the team to Herbert Schnitzer junior. Lamm passed away unexpectedly just a few weeks later. In the 2020 season just finished, BMW Team Schnitzer returned to the podium of the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring under new management, finishing in third place with the BMW M6 GT3. As a result of the required realignment of the works-based team structure, the partnership with BMW Team Schnitzer will not continue. “We are very proud of having played a significant role in shaping international motorsport with BMW for more than half a century and of the respect given to Schnitzer Motorsport throughout the world,” said Herbert Schnitzer junior. “We are also very proud of the successes and titles that we celebrated together over the decades, in touring car racing, in GT racing, at Le Mans, in Macau and at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife. We would like to thank BMW for the partnership spanning decades, and for the trust that was always placed in us. We really enjoy looking back on everything we have achieved with BMW.

New event format, the same winners: At the first-ever virtual award ceremony for the BMW Sports Trophy, last year’s winners Gabriele Piana (ITA) and Team Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport were once again crowned the overall winners of the driver and team standings. Since the current pandemic situation this year mean it was impossible to host an in-person ceremony, the traditional season review of the 59th edition of the renowned customer racing competition was broadcast on BMW Motorsport’s Facebook page and YouTube channel. Like last year, Piana was once again the measure of all things in the driver rankings in the 2019\/20 classification period. The 34-year-old racked up a total of 945 points and received a cash prize of 30,000 euros for his second BMW Sports Trophy success. Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport was also a ‘repeat offender’ this year. 874 points saw team principal Michael Bonk’s crew secure their second overall win in a row in the team standings. A total prize fund of 350,000 euros was paid out to the 25 most successful drivers and the top ten teams. In the 2019\/20 season, 379 drivers and 71 teams registered for the BMW Sports Trophy competitions. “In light of the specific circumstances, it was a more than challenging season for us all,” said Jonas Krauss, Head of Sales Customer Racing, who led the virtual award ceremony. “But the privateer BMW teams and drivers around the world proved once again that they are at the forefront in international motorsport. They were not only more than worthy representatives of the BMW colours, they also provided countless unforgettable highlights. Congratulations to this year’s prize winners, particularly to the winners of the driver and team standings, Gabriele Piana and Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport. Winning the BMW Sports Trophy once is a tremendous achievement. To do it twice in a row demonstrates an unprecedented will to win, outstanding dedication and real team spirit. For that they have my great respect and thanks.” The 2019\/20 classification period was characterised by the coronavirus pandemic in particular, which temporarily brought all wheels to a standstill. But after the restart and a strong season, the privateer BMW teams recorded an impressive 118 class wins in 32 series and race events, as well as twelve driver and team titles. Particular highlights included the 20th BMW overall win in the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring (GER) and the one-two victory with the BMW M6 GT3 in the 8-hour race in Indianapolis (USA). The BMW M4 GT4 and the BMW M240i Racing also won various titles, and the BMW M2 CS Racing made its successful race debut. Successful defending champions: Gabriele Piana and Hofor Racing.Piana, who represented Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport and the RN Vision STS Racing team this season, continued his winning streak of 2019 in the ADAC GT4 Germany, the GT4 European Series and the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS). In addition to the title in the driver standings in the ADAC GT4 Germany, he celebrated a total of five class wins in the BMW M4 GT4. That saw him relegate his team-mates Michael Schrey (GER) and America’s Robby Foley into second and third place. “It feels a little unreal, particularly after this difficult year,” said Piana. “We gave it everything we had and pushed ourselves to the limit throughout the whole season. We had a few difficulties, including in the GT4 European Series. But on the other hand, we won the ADAC GT4 Germany title. I definitely didn’t expect that at the beginning of the year but it feels well deserved because we worked extremely hard. There are a lot of people behind these achievements. Without all of them and without such a reliable car, there’s no way it would have been possible so I’m very grateful for this and would like to thank everyone involved from the bottom of my heart. This award is also for you. I’m over the moon and proud to have won the title for the second time and hope that I can keep this streak going next year.” In the BMW Sports Trophy team standings there was no beating the Swiss team Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport once again. A total of 13 podiums in the ADAC GT4 Germany, the Nürburgring Endurance Series, the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring and in the 24H SERIES brought home the second overall win. Second and third place went to the teams Avia Sorg Rennsport and BimmerWorld Racing. Michael Bonk (GER), team principal of Bonk Motorsport, said: “In such difficult times as the ones we are currently experiencing, it is extremely important to have a strong team behind you. I am incredibly lucky to have a team like that around me. We face each challenge together and master it perfectly. I’m delighted to be receiving this award and would like to thank everyone involved from the bottom of my heart.” The renewed triumph saw the team receive a cash prize of 30,000 euros in addition to the winner’s trophy.Schubert Motorsport provides BMW Customer Racing ‘Moment of the Year’.The year’s award for the BMW Customer Racing ‘Moment of the Year’ went to Schubert Motorsport.

The shakedown also helped BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team get more familiar with van der Mark’s personal preferences. “It is important to do a shakedown with a new rider, and the day at Miramas was very productive,” said BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “Michael had his first opportunity to take to the track with the new BMW M 1000 RR and get to know his race bike for the upcoming WorldSBK season better. He was also able to provide us with initial feedback on where we can customise his bike to suit him better. For example, in terms of ergonomics, the seating position, the position of the handlebar and the footrests, through to preferences when it comes to electronics. With the information that we gathered during this shakedown, we know the direction we need to go in with Michael’s bike to be well prepared for the first proper tests in 2021.” “It was really good for me to have a first shakedown with the bike at Miramas,” said van der Mark. “I think it was also really helpful to work together with the team and to get used to each other. We tried a couple of things which we normally don’t have the time for during a normal test so I think it was really positive and I was just happy to be back on the bike this year and I am really looking forward to the next test.” \n"}

Spectacular racing, big prize money, award presentations, sensational world firsts: BMW SIM Live, which this year was streamed as an online event due to the pandemic, represented the grand finale of the 2020 BMW Motorsport SIM Racing season and served up a show full of highlights. In the grand finals of the BMW SIM 120 Cup and the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup, victories went to professional sim racers Joshua Rogers (AUS)and Erhan Jajovski (MKD). A total prize purse of over € 25,000 was up for grabs in the two races. The event also offered the opportunity to look back on the extremely successful first season of the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing commitment, as well as looking ahead to the programme for the coming season, which is even bigger and better. “In terms of digital activations, sim racing and Esports went through the roof last year – the figures were really unbelievable,” said Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand Experience BMW, in his opening speech. “This rapid development shows that we were absolutely right when we took the decision in 2019 to significantly expand our sim racing commitment. In the future, we will continue to work to achieve the perfect symbiosis between real and virtual racing. I can assure all the fans that sim racing is a fundamental part of our motorsport and Esports strategy – and it will remain so.” Rudolf Dittrich, Head of BMW Motorsport SIM Racing, said: “BMW SIM Live was the icing on the cake at the end of the first season of our expanded BMW Motorsport SIM Racing commitment. Thank you to everyone involved for the spectacular live show, and congratulations to the two winners of the grand finals in our BMW SIM Cups, Joshua Rogers and Erhan Jajovski. Today’s races were top class, as they have been all season. We saw the best sim racers in the world go head to head in virtual BMW race cars and are already looking forward to giving them even more opportunities to compete at the highest level next year.” Rogers and Jajovski win the grand finals.From a sporting perspective, the spotlight was on the grand finals of the two BMW SIM Cups at BMW SIM Live. Over the course of the season, a total of 22 of the world’s top sim racers had qualified for the two finals via six races in the BMW SIM 120 Cup, in the virtual BMW M8 GTE, and ten races in the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup. The finals were held as part of BMW SIM Live. The grand final of the BMW SIM 120 Cup took place on the iRacing simulation platform at ‘Silverstone Circuit’, as voted for on Twitter by the community in advance of the event on the iRacing simulation platform. Joshua Rogers took the victory and was rewarded with a cheque for 12,000 US dollars and a trophy featuring multimedia elements, elaborately designed by BMW Designworks. Second and third place went to Maximilian Bendcke (GER) and Graham Carroll (GBR), who received 6,000 and 3,000 US dollars in prize money for their efforts. “What an Event! Massive thanks to BMW who managed to put this event on in spite of the pandemic,” said Rogers. “First, qualifying went well. I managed to get the lap in when it counted. Start of the race wasn't so good as I was falling back quickly. Then, I tried to pick up places where I could. Did an aggressive move on Maximilian which did not pay off. I got a penalty for it, which is fairplay. After that I tried to pick my line and analyze what was going on. And in the second to last corner the heavens opened up and the rest is history.” The grand final of the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup took place at the virtual Nürburgring on the rFactor2 simulation platform. Erhan Jajovski was victorious in the BMW M2 CS Racing, ahead of Nikodem Wisniewski (POL) and Risto Kappet (EST). They received € 2,000, € 1,000 and € 500 for their podiums. “In qualifying, luckily I nailed the last lap, which put me on pole position,” said Javovski. “I am speechless now, I am so happy and relieved that I got the pole position and that the start of the race went smoothly. After that I just kept on driving until the end. I expected to be more under pressure, but it went my way this time.” Awards, world firsts and looking ahead to the 2021 season.Within the BMW SIM Live show, which was presented by well-known sim racing presenter Ben Constanduros and BMW works driver Martin Tomczyk (GER) as co-presenter, BMW Motorsport SIM Racing presented the “Move of the Year” and “Influencer of the Year” awards to Carlos Ramos (PUR) and sim racing YouTuber Jimmy Broadbent (GBR). Ramos caused great excitement among the community with his spectacular drift pit stop, while Broadbent thrills thousands of fans every day with his extensive coverage of sim racing. BMW SIM Live also provided a stage for some sensational world firsts. BMW works driver Philipp Eng (AUT) presented the steering wheel for the new BMW GT race car, the BMW M4 GT3, which was developed together with sim racing hardware manufacturer Fanatec. It is the first steering wheel in the world that can be used in both a real race car and a race simulator without any modifications. Other world firsts included the introduction of the virtual BMW M4 GT3 on the iRacing platform, before the real race car has even contested its first race, and the presentation of the “Fusion SL Concept” hybrid furniture, which can be transformed from modern lounge furniture to a fully-functioning sim rig in just a few simple steps. Looking ahead to the coming season, BMW Motorsport SIM Racing presented a comprehensive programme. This includes an even larger range of BMW SIM Cups, close cooperations with four of the best sim racing teams in the world, establishing a BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Academy, and the announcement of the start of a BMW Motorsport SIM Racing World Tour.\n"}

The international motorsport landscape is currently undergoing a raft of changes – and as a result, this also applies to the works-based BMW Motorsport team line-up. Therefore, the long collaboration with the iconic BMW Teams RBM and Schnitzer will not continue. BMW Team RMG will be working with BMW Motorsport to develop the new BMW M4 GT3 in the coming season. After the premature end of the Class 1 DTM, the fields of activity for BMW’s works-based presence had to be adapted. BMW Team RMG, that previously was one of the works teams in the DTM and celebrated two driver’s titles with Marco Wittmann (GER), will serve as a development team for the new BMW M4 GT3 in the future. In contrast, the collaboration with BMW Team RBM is ending, as there is no longer a classic works involvement in the new, customer racing-based DTM. The BMW Motorsport family has enjoyed many fantastic successes with Bart Mampaey’s (BEL) team on the international motorsport stage over 25 years. Founded in 1995, the team became an official BMW works team in 2006 after being crowned European and World Touring Car Champions. Two more World Championship titles followed. With its outstanding performances, BMW Team RBM has made a major contribution to the fact that BMW became one of the most successful manufacturers in the World Touring Car Championship. Since the return to DTM in 2012, BMW Team RBM has been one of the BMW works teams in the series and claimed nine race victories. The necessary realignment of the works-based team structure also means that the partnership with BMW Team Schnitzer will not be continued. Since the 1960s, Schnitzer Motorsport has been one of the most influential and successful teams in the world of international GT and touring car racing – always with BMW race cars. BMW Team Schnitzer has forever earned an important place in BMW history, thanks to many prestigious national and international triumphs in renowned championships and at legendary endurance races, like those at the Nürburgring and at Le Mans. Through its passionate commitment and magnificent success, Schnitzer has also been instrumental in shaping the BMW brand in terms of sportiness and dynamics. The level of the team’s performance was demonstrated most recently at the Nürburgring 24 Hours, when it finished third under the leadership of Herbert Schnitzer jun. Quotes: Bart Mampaey (Team Principal BMW Team RBM): “It is a great shame, but we respect the fact that BMW Motorsport is unable to continue the collaboration with us as a works team. I would like to thank BMW for the fantastic partnership, which we have enjoyed for 25 long years. BMW has always been at our side, from the very beginning to the final curtain in the DTM, and our relationship will remain a strong one, even if we are no longer a works team. Times are changing and we are all facing a challenging future. At RBM, we will initially reduce our racing activities. However, that does not mean this is the end of our motorsport chapter. We want to continue in motor racing and see what options arise. I also think that we can apply the values and skills that we have at RBM in other industries outside motorsport. They always say: when one door closes, another one opens. So I am very excited to see what opportunities come our way in the future.” Herbert Schnitzer jun. (Team Principal BMW Team Schnitzer): “We very much regret that, given the changes in motorsport, it is no longer possible to continue the cooperation with BMW Motorsport. However, we obviously understand and respect the decision. We are proud that we Schnitzers have, together with BMW, shaped international motorsport for so many decades. It is a pleasure to look back on all the big successes we have enjoyed together in such a wide range of categories. We are also very proud to be a part of motorsport history at BMW. We would like to thank BMW Motorsport for this long, unique partnership. BMW was our life and our passion.” Stefan Reinhold (Team Principal BMW Team RMG): “We are very much looking forward to our new role as development team for the BMW M4 GT3, and thank BMW Motorsport for the faith it has placed in us. The BMW M4 GT3 is the new flagship of BMW Motorsport, and we will do our bit to make it another successful BMW. For us as racers and technicians, it is very exciting to be closely involved in the development of a race car. We will now apply all our know-how and skills to this project.” Note to editors: Over the course of the coming week, we will pay tribute to the two departing BMW teams, RBM and Schnitzer, and will look back at milestones in the shared history. \n"}

The BMW M4 GT4 played a leading role in the technology transfer between real-world motorsport and sim racing in the 2020 season. The introduction of the car on the simulation platforms iRacing and Assetto Corsa Competizione is just as much a new dimension of creating synergies between real-world and virtual racing as the livery contest and the virtual track day with the BMW M customer racing car. BMW Motorsport SIM Racing followed all these projects with intense media coverage. “The BMW M4 GT4 is a superb example of what we mean when we emphasise that the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing projects are also about synergies between real-world and digital racing. This pillar of our racing programme is self-contained, but pays in to all of the BMW Group’s motorsport,” says Rudolf Dittrich, Head of BMW Motorsport SIM Racing. “Building the bridge between real-world and digital racing makes a great deal of sense in the case of a BMW M customer racing car such as the BMW M4 GT4. Many customers have explicitly asked for this car to be implemented. On the one hand, to have spectacular virtual races – particularly during the pandemic – and on the other hand, to practice for the next real appearance at home, and in doing so have almost exactly the same driving experience as in the real-world racing car. Enabling a much larger customer base to test the BMW M4 GT4 virtually, and in doing so to get a good initial impression, might result in one or more additional interested parties in a real car. No doubt we will apply this principle again in future projects with BMW racing cars.” Development of the digital BMW M4 GT4.The digital version of the BMW M4 GT4 made its debut on the simulation platform iRacing at the start of June. Over the course of the year, the platform Assetto Corsa Competizione also introduced the car. To make the driving experience as realistic as possible for the sim racers, the BMW Motorsport engineers collaborated extremely closely and transparently with the simulation platform colleagues. In the case of iRacing, the developers received two large data packages of several gigabytes from BMW Motorsport. Dittrich explained the process in a press release at the end of May 2020 as follows: “The first package contained the CAD data with all the specifications of the car parts. That is exactly the same data that a supplier gets from us to produce the real component. iRacing also scanned a real car, in this case the Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT4. The second large data package contained all the information on driving dynamics. We use the same data set to do simulate lap times or to operate our BMW Motorsport simulator, for example. This data includes damper curves, engine performance curves, axle kinematics, weight distribution, aerodynamic values: any figures that we had calculated for the car we passed on to iRacing. iRacing ended up knowing as much about the car as our customer teams do.” Virtual track day with the BMW M4 GT4.To give potential customers the opportunity to experience the BMW M4 GT4 in the race simulator, the first BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Track Day was held at the end of June. A selection of BMW M customer racing drivers took to the track at the virtual Nürburgring and received tuition from well-known “instructors”: BMW works driver Philipp Eng, who enjoys great success in the simulator himself, and the three sim racers Alexander Voß, Laurin Heinrich and Nils Koch. In addition to the pure driving experience, the procedure during a race was also simulated, with free practice sessions, qualifying and races. Instructors used a voice app to give the participants valuable tips on set-up work with digital race cars. “With their various commitments and activities, BMW has long demonstrated how seriously they take the field of sim racing,” said Eng in the press release at that time. “This event showed that once again. I think it’s great that customer teams and drivers from the BMW Sports Trophy are also being given the opportunity to collaborate with sim experts.” BMW M4 GT4 livery contest.In July 2020, BMW Motorsport SIM Racing announced the BMW M4 GT4 Livery Contest with the tagline “THE FUSION OF REAL WORLD AND SIM RACING” – a design competition in which entrants from the sim racing community were able to let their creativity run free, and even have their dream design feature on the real-world racetrack. Chan Wen Bin prevailed over numerous rivals with his suggested design for the BMW M4 GT4 and received a cash prize of 3,000 US dollars and the joy of having his design used on a real racing car. The BMW M customer racing team FK Performance contested the season finale of the DTM Trophy in Hockenheim with the BMW M4 GT4 in the winning design in November 2020. The 27-year-old graphic designer from Malaysia won over not only the top-class jury consisting of multi-media artist and BMW Art Car artist Cao Fei, Michael Scully (Global Automotive Director @Designworks) and BMW works driver Bruno Spengler with his design; BMW Motorsport fans also had the opportunity to vote for their favourites via social media and influence the decision. “With the BMW M4 GT4 Livery Contest we showed that in addition to racing drivers, you can also integrate and speak to other communities, as well as support graphic designers digitally via sim racing and make them more well known,” says Dittrich. BMW SIM Live on 5th December 2020.BMW SIM Live 2020, which will be broadcast from 4.00 PM CET on 5th December via a livestream on the BMW Motorsport and BMW Esports channels, will include the final races in the BMW SIM 120 Cup and the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup.

It’s always nice to be on top of the timing sheets at the end, but we don’t get any points in the championship for that. It’s all about the work that we accomplished in the last few days and we really had no hold-ups and reliability issues at all. Maximilian Günther has obviously carried his speed from season six over into season seven. We are also very pleased with the way Jake Dennis has progressed over the course of the test. He gave us very good feedback and got up to speed very quickly.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21): “It is obviously great to have set the fastest time of the week again, as we did last year. Having said that, the focus of the tests was not on lap times. We were fully focussed on completing our programme, and we did a good job of that. We had worked very hard and well in the run-up to this test. Here at Valencia, we took the opportunity to try some different things with the new car. I think we did a very good job.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21): “I think we can be happy with our performance during this test. The car seems to be working well. Personally, I was able to adapt to the specific demands of Formula E very quickly. I familiarised myself with the software and all the other processes, so that I now feel far better prepared for the first race in Santiago. I am now very much looking forward to my first race in January.”\n"}

I would love for us to be able to build on that in 2021.” One of the big winners among the ranks of the BMW works drivers was Bruno Spengler (CAN). He won two titles on the platform iRacing. First, in the virtual BMW M8 GTE, he won the IMSA iRacing Pro Series, set up by the IMSA series during the enforced break from real-world racing. In addition to Spengler, many other regular IMSA drivers contested the series, including BMW representatives Nick Catsburg (NED), Philipp Eng (AUT), Jesse Krohn (FIN), John Edwards, Connor De Phillippi and Robby Foley (alle USA). In autumn, Spengler also won the title in the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO with Team BMW Bank and his driver colleagues Kay Kaschube and Nils Koch (both GER) at the wheel of the BMW Z4 GT3. All of the races in the series were at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife. Also in the virtual BMW Z4 GT3, Eng alongside Laurin Heinrich, Alexander Voß (both GER) and Team BS+COMPETITION celebrated the overall win at the iRacing 24h Nürburgring. BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver Maximilian Günther (GER) won the Pro title in ‘THE RACE All-Star Cup’ on the platform rFactor 2 and also performed very well in the ‘ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge’ with a few race wins. In that competition, Team Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) in the virtual BMW iFE.20 won the sim racers title, which saw him also snag a starting spot in the finals of the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup at BMW SIM Live. The twelfth and final starting place for these finals went to Cem Bölükbasi (TUR) for his win at the sim racing event organised by Jochen Schweizer. Bölükbasi, Siggy and Heinrich joined forces with Coque Lopez (ESP) to form the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Team for the V10 R-League on the Assetto Corsa platform and enjoyed several successes against top-class competition in the inaugural season of the team competition. The DTM also held a digital championship this year. The team title in the DTM Esports Championship on the platform RaceRoom went to the crew of team captain and BMW DTM driver Sheldon van der Linde (RSA). Timo Glock (GER) and Lucas Auer (AUT) were also in action in the virtual BMW M4 DTM as pro racing driver representatives. The sim racer driver’s title went to Moritz Löhner (GER), who, as a member of Sheldon van der Linde’s team, was also racing in a BMW M4 DTM. BMW SIM Live on 5th December 2020.BMW SIM Live 2020, which will be broadcast from 4.00 PM CET on 5th December via a livestream on the BMW Motorsport and BMW Esports channels, will include the final races in the BMW SIM 120 Cup and the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup.

From December 2 to 6, 2020, Art Basel will present “OVR: Miami Beach”, the latest edition of the show’s Online Viewing Rooms.  ->","completion":" Munich\/London\/Miami Beach. In cooperation with Acute Art and as long-term global partner of Art Basel, BMW will showcase the latest artworks of Lu Yang, BMW Art Journey awardee of 2019. The Shanghai-based artist is represented by Société, Berlin. From December 2 to 6, 2020, Art Basel will present “OVR: Miami Beach”, the latest edition of the show’s Online Viewing Rooms. The digital platform will feature galleries accepted to the 2020 edition of Art Basel Miami Beach and will be accompanied by a program of online events, including talks and gallery walk-throughs.In collaboration with Acute Art, leading producer of visionary virtual and augmented reality (AR) artworks, and Lu Yang, BMW will present a new AR work where “DOKU”, the artist’s digital avatar, takes over the physical world in the form of a giant dancing superhero. The installation, titled “Gigant DOKU”, is developed by a game engine and incorporates motion capture image data from Tokyo and Bali gathered during the artist’s BMW Art Journey. The Augmented Reality Experience is available on Acute Art App. Please find the instructions for the app at the end of this text.„For me as an artist who has been working on digital art projects for many years now, it is a great honor to gain the possibility of working with Acute Art. They are the leading producer of visionary AR artworks and have been working with so many successful artists in the field of AR before. During my BMW Art Journey, I had the chance to cooperate with different artists from several backgrounds and to deepen my research in motion capture technologies – knowledge and material that I can now use for my artworks. Even though I had to pause my travels due to the coronavirus, I am thankful that I am now able to proceed digitally, with the full support and creative freedom provided by the BMW Group,” says Lu Yang.“We are so excited to work with Lu Yang, one of China’s most prominent young artists, who explores new immersive media to create poetic works that bridge the disciplines. The BMW Art Journey ‘Human Machine Reverse Motion Capture Project’ demonstrates his keen interest in the anthropology of dance into the virtual sphere employing cutting-edge motion-capture technology and robotics. Due to the global pandemic, his physical voyage to Indonesia, India, and Japan had to be adjusted but through a collaboration with Acute Art his dancing avatars can travel across the world digitally. AR makes interactive versions of his dancing figures possible, the first of which will be launched on the Acute Art app in conjunction with ‘OVR: Miami Beach’. Anyone who has downloaded the free app can interact with this dematerialized dancer and place him anywhere, film him and share his performance with friends globally. For an artist concerned with how the human body can overcome its physical limitations, this AR project represents an important step into the era of virtual art and curation,” says Daniel Birnbaum, Artistic Director, Acute Art.The hard-edged, kinetic animations and paintings of Lu Yang (b. 1984) deploy the latest digital tools to fuse Chinese cultural and spiritual influences with distinctive imagery inspired by manga comics, contemporary youth and gaming subcultures. Trained at the China Academy of Art in Hangzhou, and continuing to undertake studies in robotics, the artist is equally at home with traditional dance and performance practices as with futuristic notions about an emerging post-gender and post-human society in which the lines between the objective and metaphysical world are completely blurred. His distinctive body of work is an example of strikingly new visions emerging from a young generation of artists in today’s technologically advanced China.Lu Yang’s BMW Art Journey entitled “Human Machine Reverse Motion Capture Projec\" examines how the human body can be trained to overcome its physical limitations and explores its deployment in historical and present-day cultures. His research looks into how humans negotiate their evolving relationship with machines that may ultimately surpass human limitations. During his trip to Bali, Indonesia, in January 2020, Lu Yang employed sophisticated motion-capture devices to record dancer’s gestures, including facial, finger- and eye-capture techniques. These latest technological devices collected and analyzed the subtlest body movements and can mimic them using robotic technologies.All works on view in “OVR: Miami Beach” relate to and are inspired by Lu Yang’s BMW Art Journey, which has continued in the digital realm after the novel coronavirus made it difficult to visit some of the originally planned destinations. More broadly, the selected works highlight the artist’s creative evolution in recent years, leading up to a current body of work in which Lu Yang’s digital avatar has become the subject of his continuing digital journey. Together, the works transport viewers into a fictional universe like no other, in which centuries-old philosophical concerns about what it means to be human are investigated in a hypnotic, cohesive and often disquieting visual language.All digital artworks of Lu Yang will be accessible for VIPs and public in “OVR: Miami Beach” from December 2, 10am ET, to December 6, midnight ET, via the following link: https:\/\/www.artbasel.com\/events\/detail\/17306To fully discover and experience the interactive artwork of Lu Yang “Gigant DOKU” (from December 2, 10am ET), the Acute Art app is available free of charge on the App Store or Google Play.

{"prompt":"Since the times of Empress “Sisi”, the spa town in the South Tyrolean Adige Valley has been a popular destination for those seeking relaxation, taking the route across the Alps to enjoy not only the varied mountain landscape but also the mild climate and Italian way of life. In the MINI Cooper SD Countryman ALL4, even the journey over winding mountain passes becomes a grandiose experience.  ->","completion":" Munich. Spring comes earlier, summer stays longer, and autumn also has its special charm in the South Tyrol region. Italian lifestyle meets Austrian-German culture before a spectacular mountain backdrop. Active holidaymakers will find ideal conditions for cycling and hiking tours between Mediterranean vegetation and spectacular rock formations, especially in the area around the traditional spa town of Merano. And after the fruit and wine harvest, numerous regional folk festivals and culinary specialities turn the trip to South Tyrol into an journey of culinary delights.Even Empress Elisabeth \"Sisi\" of Austria took on the rather arduous journey at the time across the Alps to seek relaxation in Merano and enjoy a breath of the South. Today, visitors can reach the Etsch Valley quite quickly and comfortably via the Brenner motorway and an express road called \"MeBo\", which connects Merano with Bolzano, the capital of South Tyrol. But the fastest route is rarely the most beautiful route to reach your destination. When driving in a car which has been designed for versatile driving fun, such as the MINI Cooper SD Countryman ALL4 There are a number of high alpine roads which cross the border from Austria to Italy. At a maximum altitude of around 1,500 metres, the Reschen Pass, which is passable in all seasons, is the lowest Alpine crossing in this region. From Landeck, the road leads across the Inn valley and the Nauders plateau to the Reschensee lake. The church tower of Alt-Graun, which juts out of the water, still reminds us of the villages that sank into the waters of the dammed lake after the construction of a storage power station 70 years ago. Anyone leaving the Brenner motorway near Sterzing can reach Merano via the Jaufen Pass, which is located at almost 2.100 metres above sea level. This connection is comparatively short, but with around 20 narrow bends it offers plenty of opportunity to experience hallmark MINI go-kart feeling. Even higher up is the Timmelsjoch, which connects the Ötztal region in Austria with the Italian Passaier valley. Along the route, at up to 2,500 metres, there are magnificent views of snow-capped peaks and a landscape of alpine meadows, forests and barren rock.Once in Merano, visitors immediately become aware of the Mediterranean climate. This is due to the city's location in a basin into which mainly warm air from the south flows. And this is also why palm trees and other Mediterranean plants thrive, as do the colourful flowers and plants in the public parks in the city centre. Historical buildings such as the municipal theatre and the Kurhaus (spa house) remind us of Merano's boom as a tourist resort in the late19th and early 20th century. The extensive spa promenade on the banks of the river Passer was also built at that time. The centre of the city, which is closed to car traffic, is characterised by its picturesque arcades (Lauben). Beneath magnificent arches, it is home to old-established shops, cafés and restaurants that attract locals and visitors alike.You can enjoy plenty of sunshine and mild temperatures until well into the autumn in South Tyrol. Not long afterwards, the action shifts from the valley to the mountains. As soon as the first slopes are covered with snow, numerous ski areas attract winter sports enthusiasts. The youngest attraction for skiing enthusiasts is located about 50 kilometres south-east of Merano. In the Carezza ski area, a new cable car is currently being built featuring a mountain station which is integrated into the rocky landscape almost invisibly. The arrival hall is designed in the style of an atmospherically illuminated cave and is thus reminiscent of the crystal palace from the legend of the dwarf king Laurin, which is widespread in South Tyrol. The Carezza ski area covers around 40 km of slopes and is a popular destination for excursions and holidays, not only in winter. The tourist area stretches from the high altitudes of the Dolomites to Lake Carezza, where Empress \"Sisi\" spent the early summer days more than 120 years ago.\n"}

Two BMW satellite teams will be competing alongside the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team in the upcoming 2021 season: the Italian RC Squadra Corse team and the Bonovo Action team from Germany. Both teams will be racing with one BMW M 1000 RR. RC Squadra Corse will compete with Eugene Laverty (IRL), who spent the 2020 season with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and will be combining appearances in the WorldSBK with his role as BMW test rider. Bonovo Action will continue the successful cooperation with rider Jonas Folger (GER). Both satellite teams will work closely with BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. “Cooperation with satellite teams represents another important step for our involvement in the FIM Superbike World Championship”, says Markus Schramm, Director of BMW Motorrad. “It is great to have two more BMW M 1000 RRs in the field alongside the two motorbikes from our works teams, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team with riders Tom Sykes and Michael van der Mark. I would like to extend a warm welcome to the two satellite teams in our WorldSBK project. The Bonovo Action team with Jonas Folger is the first German team to register to compete in the WorldSBK with a Bavarian rider on a Bavarian motorbike. That is a special combination. I am also delighted that Eugene Laverty will remain an integral member of our BMW family, applying his talents and his knowledge of BMW superbikes in our satellite team RC Squadra Corse, newly formed but already well known in the World Superbike paddock. I hope that they will all enjoy a successful 2021 WorldSBK season!” “We are really looking forward to the partnership with Bonovo Action and RC Squadra Corse,” adds BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “The cooperation with these two teams allows us to diversify our WorldSBK project even more. They will communicate closely with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. The benefit for us is that we can access yet more collective feedback. The teams are also very strong as far as the riders are concerned. Jonas Folger and Eugene Laverty are not just fast, but their many years of experience allow them to make important contributions to the further development of the BMW M 1000 RR. It is great that Eugene will still be on board, and to welcome Jonas to the BMW family.” Headed by team owner Roberto Colombo, the RC Squadra Corse team will be appearing under a new name in 2021 but has been present in the World Superbike paddock for some time. The team has been competing in the World Superbike Championship since 2016 and also appeared in the 2020 Supersport World Championship. The 34-year-old Laverty is one of the most experienced riders in the WorldSBK. 2020 saw him complete his first season with BMW as a rider for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Right from the start, Laverty was closely involved in development of the BMW M 1000 RR and brings plenty of experience to the RC Squadra Corse team. The Bonovo Action team is headed by team owner Jürgen Röder and team manager Michael Galinski. The team dominated the International German Motorcycle Championship IDM with Folger in 2020. Folger claimed the championship title, winning all eight races in the IDM season. The team also competed with Folger at the two WorldSBK events in Barcelona (ESP) and Estoril (POR), with both team and rider delivering convincing performances. The 27-year-old Folger began his international career in 2008. In subsequent years, he competed in all MotoGP World Championship classes, moving from the 125s (that later became Moto3), to Moto2 and then MotoGP.\n"}

From Thursday, the Formula E teams will be completing test laps at Valencia (ESP) in preparation for the start of Season 7 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, planned for January. Representing BMW i Andretti Motorsport are Maximilian Günther (GER) and Jake Dennis (GBR) in the BMW iFE.21. While Dennis is new to the team, Günther is entering his second season as a BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver after a successful debut year. After achieving the best time during the tests at Valencia last year, he went on to secure two wins and a second place during the race season. Now, in an interview, he looks ahead to the upcoming season, talks about the team’s particular strengths and where they have room for improvement, evaluates his new team-mate and explains why he moved to Monaco (MON) in the summer. Maximilian, how have you spent the time since the Season 6 final in Berlin? Maximilian Günther: “For me there was a seamless transition to the new season. We started test driving the new car straight away and that’s how things continued for me over the past months, lots of test drives with the new car, simulator tests in Munich and a large number of meetings, both virtually and in Munich at BMW Motorsport with my engineers. Since the end of the season in Berlin, we have pursued our path and objectives in development and worked on every minor detail. I really enjoyed that as I am a real perfectionist. The off-season has been very productive to date and we are all looking forward to things getting started again.” As well as taking part in testing you also moved. Günther: “That’s right. I moved to Monaco right after the races in Berlin. It was a fantastic step for me for many reasons. Monaco is an amazing place for me as a sportsman because the training conditions are first-class, be that the fitness studios, running tracks or road bike tracks. And then there’s the consistent climate with pleasant, warm temperatures all year round, and naturally a large number of other sports personalities live in Monaco. I also chose the location so that I am able to live among colleagues and athletes who have a similar lifestyle. When I was little and watched Formula 1 in Monaco, my two goals were to race in Monaco and ideally to live there. Both came true in recent years.” How are you preparing for the test drives in Valencia? Günther: “Primarily by driving in the simulator in Munich. Preparations for an official test like this are actually very similar to preparations for a race weekend. It’s all about simulating various scenarios here as well. Everything is planned and tested, from driving a fast lap like in qualifying, through to race simulation in terms of energy efficiency. And then there are other things in focus for test drives in particular, such as various set-ups and specific ideas that you want to check out ahead of the season.” Last year was a resounding success with you getting the overall best time. Günther: “The test drives did go very well for me. I was new to the team back then. Now the situation is totally different, I have got to know the team really well and the conditions are obviously different. After a whole year working together, you know what makes each other tick and can build on this common basis. Generally speaking, the team is almost identical and has become like family. I feel right at home in the team and am really looking forward to starting the new season with the experiences from last year.” Since the cars haven’t changed all that much compared with Season 6, are you as a driver in combination with your race engineers able to make more of a difference? Günther: “I would say that the drivers are more in focus in Formula E than in other series. That’s what I really enjoy about the series. It is incredibly challenging – and yes, the collaboration with the race engineers is extremely important. You often see snippets of how much we communicate on television. That is planned down to the finest detail and every consultation has to be exact. We rely on each other implicitly and know exactly what each of us is talking about – and all of that under great stress and immense time pressure. It is wonderful and a fantastic basis that we established last season, that we are now able to build on.” What do you feel are your and the team’s greatest strengths? Günther: “Our greatest strength is that we are incredibly compact as a team. We have all the ingredients for achieving a great deal in this championship. We are very aware of what it takes. Our art is that we are very meticulous in our work and try to optimise everything, but at the end of the day know precisely what it takes and go into a race weekend with a very clear mindset. I believe that is what enables us to handle the challenges of Formula E that we face each weekend very well as a team.” Where can you make the biggest improvement compared with Season 6? Günther: “Naturally there is always room for improvement, and you try to work on all the minor details. I believe that a particular challenge in Formula E is the qualifying format. Last season we were almost always in Group 1, which is a good sign in principle, because it means that you are consistently up there near the top in the championship, but it also brings plenty of challenges. Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to make it out of Group 1 into Super Pole often enough, or into a good starting position. We have looked at this in great detail during the off-season, and I think we have drawn the right conclusions.” How well do you already know your new team-mate Jake Dennis? Günther: “I know Jake from Formula 3 days; we were even team-mates in one race in 2015. We get on really well and our collaboration was great right from the start during the test drives. When all is said and done, we got started working together straight away. I’m delighted that Jake is part of the team and that we can start the new season together. He is the kind of guy who has a lot of technical expertise, also from his experiences in the simulator at Red Bull Racing and the races in the DTM, where he was performing at a very high level in motorsport. I think that he is a great fit for Formula E and there is nothing standing in the way of us collaborating successfully as team-mates.” How are you handling the uncertainty due to the pandemic – including in terms of the race calendar? Günther: “It goes without saying that the coronavirus situation is very unusual, that applies to all of us. But I try to be as relaxed as possible when it comes to the uncertainty of the races, and not think about things too much in advance. Flexibility is key here. I accept that 100 percent and prepare myself to handle all the challenges this brings as well as I can.”\n"}

Presented by Superblue and BMW i, the art group Random International together with choreographer Wayne McGregor and his company collaborate for the online world premiere of “No One is an Island”. It will be shown exclusively on the digital channels of all participating partners in November, December 2020 and January 2021. The first teaser will go online on November 25, 2020 at 6:00 pm (CET). The live performance will take place at a later date in 2021.Random International, Studio Wayne McGregor, Superblue and BMW i share a passion for pushing boundaries and exploring new territories. All are moved by similar questions about how future generations will interact with automated and digitised processes and environments whilst embracing reduction and sustainability. For this purpose, they are collaborating on a special project: “No One is an Island”.“No One is an Island” is fuelled by science and explores electrified movement steered by advanced algorithms. It is a future-oriented reflection on how the human mind empathises with artificial intelligence and automated processes. The performance comprises sculptural, performative and musical elements. The centrepiece is a sculpture that experiments with the minimal amount of information that is actually necessary for an animated form to be recognised as human; and the fundamental impact created by subtle changes within that information. In its transition from robot to human likeness, the sculpture is accompanied by a live performance with dancers of Studio Wayne McGregor who will interact with the kinetics, further exploring the relationship between humans and technology and our capacity to empathise with a machine. The interventions of the dancers scored by Chihei Hatakeyama add a performative dimension to the sculpture, re-translating and celebrating the connection between human and mechanical movement.“Catalysed by the partnership with BMW i and the collaboration with Studio Wayne McGregor, we have elevated our ongoing ‘Fifteen Points’ series of sculptures to a whole new level. Through the addition of both a score by Chihei Hatakeyama and dedicated choreography by Wayne McGregor, we are able to explore in much more detail the as-of-yet unknown territories of 'empathy with machines’. The work is part of a wider reflection on our human need to relate to our surroundings; how does such a need to connect play out in light of an increasing automation and digitisation of our environment? Will our willingness to engage with unknown systems leave us more vulnerable? We are much looking forward to present the work in a series of live performances in 2021,” says Hannes Koch, one of the founders and directors of Random International about the collaboration.“What I find inspiring about the partnership with Random International, Superblue, BMW i and myself is that we all come together from different knowledge sets, but convene in areas of shared interest,” says Wayne McGregor. “We are all fascinated by the potential of the human body, its relationship with and to technology but most importantly our desire to generate empathetic connections between people. This is a dialogue of inter-connectedness, exploration and surprise. We have no pre-determined road map – instead, we feed from one another’s expertise and ideas to push ourselves towards new horizons.”Inspired by Pablo Picasso’s light drawings the dancers create lines of light – capturing movement and electricity visually and re-creating elements from the core of BMW i. Conceptualised as a “Gesamtkunstwerk”, “No One is an Island” is developed in an ongoing dialogue and exchange between artists, choreographer, Random International, Superblue and BMW i. Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst, Co-Founder and CEO of Superblue says, “Creating new platforms and opportunities for experiential artists to collaborate is core to Superblue’s mission, so we are delighted to partner on this project and creative dialogue between Random International, Studio Wayne McGregor, and BMW i. ‘No One is an Island’ provokes questions about the dynamics between technology and humanity that are critical to deepening our understanding of our relationship to the world and each other.”The online premiere is split in three chapters, each focusing on either sculpture, dancers or BMW i. All of them will be shared on Instagram and Facebook by Random International @randominternational, Studio Wayne McGregor @studiowaynemcgregor, Superblue @superblue.art and BMW @bmw, @bmwi, and @bmwgroupculture.“We believe that working together with great artists like Random International, represented by Superblue, and Studio Wayne McGregor is an inspiring and enriching experience for all parties involved. Speaking of BMW i, the constant exchange with creatives is essential. And just as BMW i embodies innovation, ‘No One is an Island’ synergises future and present, technology and humanity,” says Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand Experience.BMW i is standing for sustainable, future-oriented and forward-looking mobility.

The centre console, the cover of the centre tunnel and the switch panels located there are covered with cognac-coloured leather. The harmonious colour scheme also includes tone-in-tone seams and draws attention to the interior trim strips, which have been refined into unique works of art.Natural shapes and precious metal: South Africa's flora blooms on the interior trim strips.The innovative and unique design of the interior trim strips for the BMW 745Le xDrive by BMW Individual Manufaktur is the work of South African artist Nic Bladen, who draws inspiration for his work from the characteristic flora of his home country. Using plaster casts and liquid gold, silver or platinum, he creates detailed sculptures of leaves, flowers, roots and twigs, modelled on wild plants. For the art project conceived by BMW and Ellerman House, he developed a special process in which he transferred the replicas of plants cast in precious metal into a two-dimensional form that was as flat as possible. Gradually, an extensive collection of precious prints of the selected motifs from nature was created, similar to a herbarium as botanists use for documenting and identifying plants by means of dried and pressed flowers and leaves. These filigree works of art were then embedded as inlays in the interior trim strips of the vehicle with the utmost care and precision.Bladen found his motifs for refining the interior of the luxury sedan in the Fynbos region around Cape Town, which is known for its unique biodiversity. Many of the shrubs, trees, grasses and flowers that are exclusively indigenous to the area are now threatened by extinction. Among the best-known natural treasures of the Fynbos landscape are the rooibos, from whose cultivated version an internationally popular tea is made, and the protea plants, also known as sugar bushes or silver trees, whose round, often plate-sized flowers represent the heraldic flower of South Africa. With his latest works of art, Nic Bladen aims to raise awareness for the fascinating plant diversity of the Cape region. His wish: guests of Ellerman House, who admire the interior trim strips designed by him while driving in the BMW 745Le xDrive, should later recognise the plants immortalised there in the wild, in order to remember not only the luxurious driving experience, but also the diverse vegetation of South Africa, which is so worth protecting.The creation of the new chauffeur car by BMW Individual Manufaktur was documented in a video clip series well worth seeing.

{"prompt":"A round trip by car is a good way to experience the diversity of the island state's landscapes in the North Atlantic. The road network is thin and four-wheel drive is highly recommended for some excursions. The MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 can prove its talent as a robust all-rounder for any terrain on a tour to discover and explore fjords, lakes, glaciers, geysers and volcanoes.  ->","completion":" Munich. Iceland is a country of contrasts on the north-western edge of Europe. The island state in the North Atlantic is as famous for its hot springs as it is for its huge ice fields. Traditional horse breeding is still as successful here as is the internationally significant aluminium production. Tourism has also recently become increasingly important as an economic sector. The pristine natural beauty located near the Arctic Circle, the fascinating variety of the landscapes and the contrast created by active volcanoes and snow-covered glaciers attract visitors from all over the world.A weekend trip is definitely not enough time for exploring Iceland’s main attractions. The special charm of the island is only revealed on a round trip. However, Iceland's road network is thin. Many places are only accessible via gravel roads, especially in the interior of the country. Iceland's most important road link, Ring Road 1, is no exception. It has been developed into a multi-lane motorway around the capital city of Reykjavik, while some other sections of the Hringvegur are not even asphalted. The MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 is the ideal all-rounder for going on an Icelandic adventure amid glaciers and volcanoes. Its ALL4 all-wheel drive system distributes the power of its 131 kW\/178 hp 4-cylinder petrol engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology between the front and rear wheels as required on any surface and in any driving situation. 16.5 centimetres of ground clearance ensure sufficient clearance even on rough surfaces. A storage volume of between 450 and 1,390 litres is available under the tailgate of the five-seater so that the luggage required for a longer tour can be easily accommodated.Ring Road 1 runs along Iceland's coast for 1,350 kilometres, sometimes right on the coast and sometimes a bit further inland. The starting point is the ferry pier in Seyðisfjörður, where the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 sets foot on Icelandic soil for the first time. On the way south, the road follows the coastline, which features many fjords, for about 200 kilometres. Soon Vatnajökull comes into view. With a surface area of more than 8,000 square kilometres, it is the largest glacier in Europe. Vatnajökull is located at the centre of the national park of the same name, which also includes picturesque river landscapes, waterfalls and active volcanoes.Further along the route, detours into the interior lead over unpaved roads, across gravel deserts and through seemingly unreal landscapes of cooled lava rock. Near the village of Selfoss, it’s worth leaving Ring 1 and heading north for about 60 kilometres to see a spectacular natural spectacle. The two-tier Gullfoss waterfall together with the neighbouring geysers forms the \"Golden Ring\", which is one of Iceland's greatest sights.After returning to the Hringvegur, we soon reach the island’s capital. More than 60 percent of the 350,000 Icelanders live here and in the neighbouring region. Reykjavik is a modern metropolis with a lively art and music scene as well as two special landmarks. The Perlan geothermal power plant, together with restaurants and leisure facilities, is located under a large glass dome and uses hot water from deeper layers of the earth to heat not only the city's residential buildings but also the pavements of the main shopping streets. A similarly spectacular example of Iceland's modern architecture is Hallgrímskirkja, built on a hill in the centre of the city. It was designed in the 1930s, but was not completed until around 50 years later. The concrete pillars on the front side, reminiscent of basalt columns, are particularly striking. A viewing platform on the 74.5 metre high church tower allows visitors to look far beyond the city limits into Iceland's natural landscape.On the northern section of Ring Road 1 the landscape is also characterised by the contrast between the icy glacier surfaces and the hot springs, whose water rises from the volcanic interior of the earth. Iceland lies on the so-called Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The North American and Eurasian plates meet directly under the island. That is the reason why hot thermal water and molten rock rise to the surface and keep changing the island’s landscape.The MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 makes full use of its four-wheel drive on a detour to the Vestfirðir peninsula, which features many rugged fjords. The craggy coastal landscape of this arctic region in the extreme northwest of Iceland is mostly only accessible via unpaved gravel roads. The path to the fishing village of Reykhólar, located in the far west, leads past massive mountain formations of volcanic origin. After the strenuous tour we relax in one of the natural pools, which are widely used in this region and are pleasantly warm in all seasons.Just like its breathtaking natural beauty, the island’s history as a base for trade and fishing can be seen in almost every village along Ring Road 1. In Sauðárkrókur it’s worth stopping to refuel at the Verzlun H. Júlíusson general shop, which still exudes the charm of the early 20th century. The small town has a fishing port and is also considered to be the main Icelandic horse breeding centre. Nowhere else on the island will you find more horse breeding farms than in the region around Sauðárkrókur.Iceland's varied nature has more surprises in store even after having travelled more than 1,000 kilometres on Ring Road 1 and having gone on numerous trips across unpaved terrain. Near Reykjahlið, the bluish shimmering geothermal water in Jarðböð Cave really invites you to take a dip. Going for a walk on the steaming sulphur gas fields of the surrounding area is also a great thrill. And Europe's mightiest waterfall also awaits in Iceland’s north. The water masses of the Dettifoss waterfull plunge about 100 metres into a gorge of about the same depth.The magnificent landscape and the many ways you can experience nature at its most pristine, make Iceland such an exceptionally alluring destination. And in spite of the sporty temperament of the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4, the beauty of the island simply makes you want to \"slow down\". Only on the way back to Seyðisfjörður's pier, however, travellers should not trundle along but should rather get a move on in order to board the ferry on time. Because the ferry that connects Iceland with the rest of Europe leaves port only once a week.\n"}

With its powerful, dynamic single cylinder, the appearance in 2015 of the BMW G 310 R opened up the world of BMW Motorrad’s Dynamic Roadster for the capacity segment under 500 ccm. Quick and agile in the city, confident and powerful on the open road – as a result, the lively, purposeful Dynamic Roadster delighted many customers all over the world, especially newcomers. In order to sustain this going forward, BMW Motorrad has made the BMW G 310 R fit for the future and afforded it a range of enhancements.The heart of the new BMW G 310 R is still the reliable 313 ccm liquid-cooled single-cylinder engine with four valves, two overhead camshafts and electronic fuel injection. The cylinder inclination to the rear and the cylinder head rotated by 180 degrees with intake at the front and exhaust at the rear remain the design characteristics. This arrangement follows the logic of optimal combustion air ducting and results in a particularly compact vehicle architecture. With an output of 25 kW and now offers an even more sensitive throttle response. Automatic idle speed increase when starting also prevents a possible sudden stalling of the engine. The self-boosting anti-hopping clutch is also new. It reduces engine drag torque and provides a significant increase in driving safety - particularly during braking manoeuvres involving simultaneous downshifting. It also offers significantly reduced operating forces at the clutch lever.Whereas the BMW G 310 R was already equipped with brake lights in LED technology, the new BMW G 310 R now has a full-LED headlight for even better visibility at night and LED flashing turn indicators for increased visibility in traffic. The new LED headlight ensures particularly bright and homogeneous illumination of the road. The three light functions high beam, low beam and – depending on the country – daytime driving light can be conveniently operated using the left handlebar controls.Both, the clutch lever and the handbrake lever are now adjustable in four stages. It thus now provides ergonomic benefits – particularly for people with small hands. Stage 3 of the brake lever adjustment corresponds to the grip width until now. In the 1st position the brake lever is 6 mm closer to the handlebar.Dynamics and agility are also reflected in the design of the new BMW G 310 R. Here the visual similarity to sporty family members like the BMW S 1000 R is unmistakeable. This is also reflected in the colour scheme of the Dynamic Roadster. What all three colour options of the BMW G 310 R have in common are the engine housing covers for the alternator, clutch and coolant pump as well as footrest plate and rear grab handle, now painted in Titanium Grey Metallic.Besides the base colour, Cosmic Black, and accentuated masculine touch, another base colour option, Polar White, is now available, which together with blue painted accents represents the traditional BMW corporate colours in a fresh, dynamic way. In Sport style with the base colour, Limestone Metallic, eye-catching red \"R\" graphic on the fairing side panels and red frame and wheels, the new BMW G 310 R confidently reveals its sporty side.\n"}

The BMW Group is speeding up the shift towards electromobility and strengthening its global network for production of electrified vehicles. The company is investing 400 million euros in a new vehicle assembly at the main plant in Munich and concentrating its European production activities for internal combustion engines at the Steyr and Hams Hall locations. “We are systematically implementing our electrification strategy. By the end of 2022, each of our German plants will be producing at least one fully electric vehicle,” according to Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Production. The BMW Group has one of the automotive industry's most flexible production systems worldwide. “We are capable of producing both vehicles with combustion engines and electric drive trains on a single line and responding flexibly to customer requests,” said Nedeljković: “This is a crucial success factor.” Nedeljković has been in charge of the Production Division for just over a year. “During the Covid-19 crisis, we have proved that we can respond swiftly and effectively to even highly volatile market developments and, at the same time, permanently improve our cost structure,” underlined the Production head. “The progress made this year will reduce our fixed costs by about half a billion euros by the end of the coming year. Construction of new vehicle assembly at Plant MunichThe BMW Group is systematically gearing its main plant in Munich towards the future. Following the expansion of the body shop and construction of a new resource-efficient paint shop between 2016 and 2018, the company will be investing around 400 million euros in a new vehicle assembly between now and 2026. “We are continually developing Plant Munich towards electromobility and creating efficient and competitive production structures for this purpose,” explained Nedeljković. “This decision signals our strong commitment to the Munich location.” Manfred Schoch, Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Chairman of the European and General Works Council of BMW AG: “The decision to build a new assembly at our almost 100-year-old Munich plant shows that transformation can secure, and even create, industrial jobs in the heart of the city – if it is approached strategically, and with courage. This decision provides a model for successful transformation in the German industry.” The future assembly and its production processes will be designed for a new cluster architecture geared towards electric drive trains. Nedeljković: “This architecture will be in use from the middle of the decade. It will ramp up for the first time at our future plant in Debrecen, Hungary, before being rolled out across our global production network in stages.” The new assembly in Munich will be built on the site currently used for engine production. The combustion engines with four, six, eight and 12 cylinders produced there will be manufactured at the company’s locations in Steyr in Austria and Hams Hall in the UK going forward. “Restructuring our engine production network is a strategic move geared towards the future. We are also boosting our efficiency and optimising our capacity utilisation,” explained Nedeljković. Engine production will be relocated from Munich in stages by no later than 2024.The employees will go on to work in different planning and production areas at the Munich location or other sites in Bavaria. At its Competence Centre for E-Drive Production in Dingolfing alone, the company will increase employee numbers from 1,000 currently to up to 2,000. “The transformation of our plants and securing future jobs go hand in hand,” underlined Ilka Horstmeier, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Human Resources, with regard to the upcoming structural changes in engine production. “Here in Munich, we will prove once again that the BMW workforce can handle change. Our employees will receive intensive support and training throughout this process.” More than 50,000 people at BMW Group have already been trained for electromobility since 2009. Transformation towards electromobilityThe realignment of the production network is based on three priorities: transformation towards electromobility and digitalisation; efficiency of processes and structures; and sustainability in production and logistics. The expansion of electromobility in the production network continues. Our Chinese plant in Dadong also began producing the BMW iX3* this year. “By the end of 2022, all German plants will have at least one fully-electric vehicle in their programme,” underlined Nedeljković. From next year, the BMW i4 and BMW iX* will come off the production lines in Munich and Dingolfing respectively. Fully-electric variants of the new BMW 7 Series and the future BMW 5 Series are also ready to go in Dingolfing. Plant Regensburg will also start manufacturing the new BMW X1 in 2022, which will be available both with an combustion engine and a fully-electric drive train. From 2023, BMW Group Plant Leipzig, which has built the iconic BMW i3* electric car since 2013, will produce the successor to the MINI Countryman, with a combustion engine and as a fully-electric variant. At the same time, the BMW Group is expanding its capacity for manufacturing electric drive trains. The company is investing in production equipment for highly integrated e-drives and high-voltage batteries at the Competence Centre for E-Drive Production in Dingolfing. The Leipzig and Regensburg locations are also currently setting up equipment for production of battery modules and high-voltage batteries from 2021. In parallel, the company is also increasing production capacity for e-drive housings at Plant Steyr.“Allocating capacity in this way places a deliberate emphasis on the flexibility of our plants and makes them more efficient and more competitive. Long-term agreements with employee representatives also play an important part in this,” added Nedeljković. Sustainability in productionThe BMW Group has reduced resource consumption and CO2 emissions in vehicle production by 50 percent since 2006 – which is much more than other European manufacturers. The amount of CO2 generated per vehicle will be reduced by another 40 percent from 2019 levels by 2025 and 80 percent by 2030. “Sustainability is a fundamental aspect of modern production,” underlined Milan Nedeljković, adding: “By the end of this year, our plants worldwide will obtain their electricity exclusively, 100 percent, from renewable energy sources.” To do so they will take advantage of the best options at each location – from solar energy in Oxford, Mexico and China, to biogas in South Africa, to wind power in Leipzig. In addition to using renewable energies, water, solvent, gas and electricity consumption will be further reduced in parallel. For example, the company is using data analytics to minimise machines’ power consumption. The amount of waste per vehicle is also continuously decreasing, making the BMW Group one of the world’s most sustainable automotive manufacturers. The BMW Group’s position as sector leader in the “Automobiles” category of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices World and Europe, announced just a few days ago, underlines this. \n"}

MINI and designer Paul Smith have announced their second collaboration since 1999. Not only are they both British institutions with a strong tradition, they also share a commitment to continuous development and to ensuring their products make the future a better place. The two brands have always been committed to using the available resources responsibly and to maximum effect. In this new phase of their successful collaboration, the two brands will enter into a creative dialogue, working together to develop design solutions with an even stronger focus on sustainability.Sustainability as a mindset. The central idea behind the first Mini was already based on a sustainable principle. Conceived in the midst of the oil crisis, it was a family car that offered maximum space and driving enjoyment, while minimising the use of materials and resources. The classic Mini showed how much more you can do with less – before anyone was even talking about sustainability. Reduction was a key aspect at the time and has therefore been an integral part of the MINI mindset since the brand’s earliest days. “We are taking the sustainability-led concept of the first Mini further into the future with the MINI Vision Urbanaut – our vision for a spacious, multifunctional MINI model,” says Oliver Heilmer, Head of MINI Design. “It too offers maximum space within a small footprint. And it’s more versatile than ever. Moreover, the interior incorporates fully recycled materials, and we have avoided leather and chrome altogether.”“Key to a lot of the most iconic examples of design is simplicity,” adds Sir Paul Smith. “In other words, it’s about what you leave out, not what you add. The thinking in fashion is similar. For Paul Smith, as for MINI, sustainability has always been a natural way of approaching things, even before the word was on everyone’s lips. We have always sought a responsible approach to materials and production conditions. Using recycled packaging, reducing fabric waste and powering our shops with renewable energy sources are just a few of the measures we have introduced and we’re constantly looking at ways that we can do more.” For Oliver Heilmer, collaboration is the next logical step: “We are drawn to each other by our similarities, and then we inspire and enrich each other through the differences between the fashion world and the automotive industry. Because there is no future without sustainability.”MINI and Paul Smith.Sir Paul Smith is one of Britain’s foremost designers. He is renowned for his creative aesthetic, which combines tradition and modernity. In the late 1990s, Paul collaborated with Mini on a limited-run special edition of the classic Mini. The car was painted in a shade of blue imagined by Sir Paul, and sported neatly coordinated anthracite alloy wheels. Equally – if not even more – popular was a one-off creation to mark the classic Mini’s 40th birthday. This one was painted in Smith’s signature multicolour stripes.Further information on the planned collaboration will follow in due course.\n"}
{"prompt":"Denmark's capital is a hotspot for people who appreciate fashion, design and a laid-back lifestyle. Just the right environment for an individualist like the MINI Clubman. With its six doors, a particularly powerful diesel engine and all-wheel drive, it offers the ideal ride for a stylish shopping spree between Tivoli and Amalienborg Castle.    ->","completion":" Munich. If you want to go in search of the cliché of the Danes being cool and reserved Scandinavians, visit Copenhagen in July or August. When the temperatures are high in summer, life in the Danish capital takes place near and on the water. In the harbour basin and on the canals of Copenhagen, young Danes are out and about being loud and cheerful - not only on canoes and motorboats, but also on floating curiosities such as self-made rafts complete with sofa, fridge and sound system. On the other hand, confirming the prejudice about the Danish preference for fashion, culture and design at all times of the year is very easy. Stylish boutiques, tastefully decorated cafés and a harmonious combination of traditional and modern architecture characterise the centre of Copenhagen. So a stylish individualist on four wheels fits the street scene perfectly.The MINI Cooper SD Clubman ALL4 is the ideal companion for a shopping tour through the trendy districts of the city. Four doors, the stretched roofline and the two laterally opening split doors at the rear make it an exceptional phenomenon in the premium compact segment. As a modern version of the classic Shooting Brake concept, it combines independent style with a high degree of variability. And driving fun is a number one priority even with a generous load in the back. Its 4-cylinder diesel engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology delivers 140 kW\/190 hp, which is always split between the front and rear axles as required via the ALL4 all-wheel drive system.Copenhagen regularly ranks among the world's top cities in terms of quality of life in surveys. In addition to the proximity to the water, the diverse cultural offerings and the high level of public infrastructure, careful urban development also contributes to this. Copenhagen is old and new at the same time. The Tivoli amusement park was opened in 1843. It is located in the direct vicinity of the town hall, which was built 50 years later, and the main railway station, which is also more than 100 years old. Nyhavn is another city tourist centre. The \"new harbour\" was built in the 17th century to connect the city's central market place to the water. The colourful gabled houses on either side of the jetty are now a popular photo motif and house shops as well as cafés, bars and restaurants, which serve as a popular meeting place for locals and visitors alike.The Royal Palace Charlottenborg near Nyhavn, which is now used as an art gallery, also dates from the 17th century. Denmark's royal family has resided in Amalienborg Castle a little further north since the early 19th century. On the palace square, surrounded by four almost identical city palaces, the changing of the royal guard can be observed every day at lunchtime.A particularly impressive example of modern Danish architecture can be found opposite Amalienborg Castle on the east side of the harbour basin. The new opera house was inaugurated in 2005 and is one of Copenhagen's most impressive buildings, with its round glass façade and wide metal roof. In the immediate vicinity of the Nyhavn and also located directly on the water, the new playhouse, completed in 2008, is one of the buildings that have shaped the cityscape in recent times. Its façade of flat bricks and large glass surfaces picks up stylistic elements of the old harbour warehouses and at the same time forms a charming contrast to the historic buildings in the surrounding area. The wide wooden footbridge surrounding the theatre building is a popular starting point for night owls, especially in summer. Other spectacular examples of the new Danish building culture are the Concert Hall on the island of Amager, opened in 2009, a 45-metre high cube with a blue illuminated fibreglass façade, and the \"Black Diamond\", an annex to the Royal National Library built in 1999 with a dark granite façade that slopes conspicuously to the side.In addition to culture and history, fashion and design are omnipresent in Copenhagen. The Danish business metropolis is home to numerous internationally renowned fashion labels. So the city tour in the MINI Cooper SD Clubman ALL4 almost automatically turns into a shopping spree. But shoes, shirts and dresses alone are not enough. In Copenhagen, visitors to many of the shops will encounter the typical Danish interior design, which is characterised by clear shapes and natural colours. Now, at the latest, the variability of the MINI Clubman comes into its own. Its storage capacity is 360 litres when all seats are used. After a visit to the Fritz Hansen branch, however, the maximum load volume of 1,250 litres may be called for. Denmark's most famous furniture manufacturer also has its origins in Copenhagen. In 1827 the master carpenter Fritz Hansen founded his workshop in the immediate vicinity of Amalienborg Castle. Since then, the Fritz Hansen company has made a name for itself primarily as a manufacturer of high-quality seating furniture. Once you’ve found what you are looking for, you can fold down the backrest elements in the rear of the MINI Clubman and temporarily swap the three back seats for the desired number of designer chairs. The figures for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, power consumption and range are measured using the methods required according to Regulation (EC) 2007\/715 as amended.

At the season finale, BMW Team RLL secured the GTLM driver’s title in the Michelin Endurance Cup for John Edwards (USA) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) as well as first places in the team and manufacturer standings for this season’s four-race endurance competition. The #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE came home in fourth place after leading significant spells of the race. Edwards and Krohn shared duties in the #24 car with Augusto Farfus (BRA), and with third place, the trio secured BMW Team RLL’s tenth podium of the season. The #25 car was driven by Connor De Phillippi (USA), Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Colton Herta (USA). The story could have ended well with a victory for them and BMW Team RLL. They were leading the race until the closing stages but following a late-race restart from the race’s ninth caution period the #25 was rear-ended by a GTD class competitor and forced to pit for repairs. That saw them dropping back from first to fourth place. The #24 car could also have finished higher than third but lost one lap due to a brake change. In the final GTLM standings, Edwards and Krohn finished the season second overall in the driver’s championship, as did the #24 team in the team standings and BMW in the manufacturer’s classification. The GTLM class titles had already been decided at the penultimate round at Laguna Seca (USA). In the 2020 season, BMW Team RLL has claimed ten podium finishes for the MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, including victories at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) and the six-hour race at Road Atlanta (USA). The #96 Turner Motorsport BMW M6 GT3, co-driven by Robby Foley, Dillon Machavern (both USA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR), who stood in for Bill Auberlen (USA), ran as high as fifth in the GTD class until a suspected brake issue on lap 235 forced Foley to the garage for repairs and ultimately, retirement. Reactions on the Twelve Hours of Sebring. John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “Even though we reached our goals of winning the Michelin Endurance Cup and finishing second in the driver’s championship, it feels a bit hollow as we wanted a better result today. The #25 guys executed a great race, and they deserved the victory. It is so unfortunate they were taken out of the win.” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “We reached our goals of winning the Michelin Endurance Cup and finish second in the driver points, but today is bittersweet. We had the potential to finish higher in the race.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “It is always a pleasure to race with BMW Team RLL. We were missing just a bit of pace today, but we got the job done and I am very happy to have contributed to the team this season.” Bruno Spengler (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “The only word I can think of is ‘disaster’. After leading the race, making no mistakes all day, a great effort by the team was wiped out. It is difficult to find any other words.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “This was not the result we deserved. We certainly had the speed to win, but not the luck.” Colton Herta (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “We put ourselves in the position to win, but a mistake by a GTD car with some ten minutes remaining swept it away. That is a tough one to swallow, but I am extremely proud of the team and am glad I got to play a part this season.” \n"}

BMW Team RLL is ready for the Twelve Hours of Sebring (USA) this coming weekend. The endurance classic marks the 2020 season finale in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA). John Edwards (USA) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) travel to Sebring as the leaders in the Michelin Endurance Cup and have their focus set on winning the title. They also can finish the season second in the driver championship. The same goes for BMW Team RLL in the team championship and BMW in the manufacturer standings. Traditionally, the Twelve Hours of Sebring is held in March as the second round of the season but in 2020 it was postponed to November due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will therefore mark the final round of an outstanding IMSA season for BMW Team RLL with a total of nine podium finishes with the MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, including victories at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) and the six-hour race at Road Atlanta (USA). The Michelin Endurance Cup is a four-race championship representing the four endurance races of a season. Edwards and Krohn have scored 37 points so far this season while Augusto Farfus (BRA) follows in second place with 31 points – level on points with the closest BMW competitors. Farfus will again compete with Edwards and Krohn in the #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE and with a success, the trio can secure first and second places in this classification. The #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE will be driven by regular drivers Connor de Phillippi (USA) and Bruno Spengler (CAN) as well as Colton Herta (USA). In the GTD class, Turner Motorsport will enter the #96 BMW M6 GT3 driven by Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley and Dillon Machavern (all USA). The 12-hour race will start on Saturday, 14th November, at 10:10 local time. Quotes ahead of the Twelve Hours of Sebring. Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “We have had success at Sebring in the past, won the race several times and qualified well. We just have to continue to push as hard as we can, to make sure we have great pit stops and to also make sure we explore the strategies we might be able to use that can help us win. Victory does not always go to the fastest, it goes to the smartest. To win the Michelin Endurance Cup would be a major accomplishment. It comprises races like Daytona, Sebring and the Petit Le Mans and we were on the podium in each of those races aside from winning Daytona. It has been a demanding year for everybody. When we finished Daytona, we thought we would continue the momentum and within a month and a half the season was on hold. Once we got going again, some of the races were so gruelling in terms of weather, temperature or a super-compressed schedule which was very demanding for all of the teams and series. And of course, we missed the spectators at most events. Everyone is looking forward to finishing off this season on a high like we started it and turning our focus to 2021.” John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “We have had some big ups and downs this season, but all of it has put us only one point away from second place in the overall championship. We are also leading the North American Endurance Championship, so we have a lot on the line at this year’s Twelve Hours of Sebring. The margins in GTLM are super close as always, so we will have to be really on top of our game to close out the season with a strong result. Hopefully, we be able to finish the season the same we started it at Daytona – on top of the podium.” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “We are leading the standings for the Michelin Endurance Cup so our first job will be to seal the deal for BMW. Also, we are only one point behind second in GTLM driver points, so a good result is especially important to finishing the season on a high note.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “I am excited to return to BMW Team RLL for the Twelve Hours of Sebring. After our strong weekend at Petit Le Mans with third place in the #24 BMW M8 GTE I believe we can keep our endurance race momentum going for another podium result.” Bruno Spengler (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “This will be my second time racing the famous Twelve Hours of Sebring. My first opportunity came in 2016 with BMW Team RLL. I co-drove the #25 BMW M6 GTLM to a second-place finish with Bill Auberlen and Dirk Werner. Sebring will be a very special place to finish my first full IMSA season and I am looking forward to both the challenge and a good result.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “The Twelve Hours of Sebring is always a flat-out brawl of a race. Typically, the pace is fast, there aren’t many yellows and a consistent car is super important. I know we’ve done a lot of analysis since our sprint race there a few months ago and I have high hopes that we can go there to fight for the win.” Colton Herta (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “I am super exited to join BMW Team RLL and my teammates Connor and Bruno for another weekend. In my opinion, Sebring is the toughest track in North America to put a lap together. I feel very privileged to drive the #25 BMW M8 GTE this weekend.” \n"}
{"prompt":"Whether offshore, onshore or airborne, the Lake Constance region can be explored in various sporty or totally relaxing ways. Thanks to the roof and rear luggage rack systems from the Original MINI Accessories range, the MINI Cooper S 3-door becomes a versatile transport talent for a varied travel experience.  ->","completion":" Munich. The countdown is on behind the scenes. But as soon as the go-ahead is given, hundreds of helpers come out in their droves. The grape harvest in Lake Constance is a spectacular event every year. Once the ripeness of the grapes and the outside temperatures perfectly match up, time is of the essence. For the late summer weather rarely remains settled for long. Miniature heavy goods vehicles now take over the roads in the wine-growing villages late into the night. The specially designed tractors – narrow enough to drive between the densely planted rows of vines, and powerful enough to pull the long, consistently full trailer loads – bring the precious grape crop to the wine presses as quickly as possible.Manoeuvrability, agility, powerful motorisation and impressive load capacity are also evident in the MINI Cooper S 3-door on its tour of the Lake Constance region. The roof and rear luggage rack systems from the MINI Original Accessories range turn the premium compact car into a versatile transport talent in a few simple steps. Folding down the rear seat backrest, with its 60 : 40 split as standard, already increases its luggage compartment capacity from 211 to up to 731 litres. The MINI roof box with a capacity of 320 litres provides more luggage space. The lockable box has imprinted stripes and MINI logos. It can be opened on both long sides and be mounted on the MINI basic carrier, also available in the MINI Original Accessories range. Alternatively to these, roof bars together with the optional roof rails are available for the MINI 3-door.The model-specific rear luggage rack preparation is already available ex works too. It can be used with the MINI rear bike carrier, specially designed for the brand’s compact car models. This can transport two bikes reliably and safely. A fold-in function means the tailgate of the vehicle can be opened even when the rear luggage rack is loaded.The MINI roof box and the MINI rear bike carrier lend an additional dimension to the brand’s hallmark creative use of space – and create the ideal conditions for a varied travel experience. The entire Lake Constance region has a well-signposted network of hiking trails and cycle paths, leading, often close to the shore, through tranquil villages or across the fruit- and wine-growing regions. Bodensee-Schifffahrt’s dense ferry network also ensures cross-border connections between the towns on the German, Austrian and Swiss lakeshores. You can take your bike with you on the passenger ferries, while car ferries operate a shuttle service between Meersburg and Constance and between Friedrichshafen and Romanshorn in Switzerland. This means visitors can make the most of Lake Constance on customised day trips – whether actively walking or cycling, totally relaxing on the water or cruising along lakeside roads in the MINI Cooper S 3-door.A favourite starting point for tours of Lake Constance is the Swabian district town of Lindau in the east of the region. Its old town centre lies on an offshore island in Lake Constance. The ferries also cast off from there, passing the lighthouse and a marble sculpture of the Bavarian lion as they sail out of the harbour. Narrow streets, shops, cafés, the old town hall built in 1422 and the carefully preserved 16th and 17th century houses give Lindau’s old town centre its charm. Sections of the historic fortifications even date back to the 11th century. The Mang Tower with its colourful glazed tiled roof denotes the end point of the city wall at the harbour. It served as lighthouse from 1180 to 1856, before its significantly taller successor in the harbour entrance was commissioned.En route from Lindau to the wine-making region of Immenstaad, Hagnau and Meersburg, the MINI Cooper S 3-door passes the tradition-steeped industrial city of Friedrichshafen. Airships have been taking off there for 120 years, while the history of the “flying cigars” is insightfully documented in the Zeppelin Museum with numerous historical exhibits and modern installations. The museum also houses an extensive art collection. Visitors to Friedrichshafen can also set off on a sightseeing flight over Lake Constance in the latest generation Zeppelin. With flights lasting between 30 and 90 minutes on offer, the low cruising altitude of approx. 300 metres guarantees the best view of what’s happening on- and offshore. \n"}

The sixth winning team in the sixth race. The second season of the BMW SIM 120 Cup drew to a close on Sunday with a thrilling two-hour race in São Paulo. Sebastian Job and Graham Carroll (both GBR), in the #2 BMW M8 GTE, delivered a commanding performance to defeat a strong field at the virtual ‘Autodromo José Carlos Pace’ on the iRacing simulation. In doing so, the two Red Bull Racing Esports drivers secured their ticket to the grand finale which will take place at BMW SIM LIVE on 5th December 2020. Over 2,000 drivers from all over the world competed in the six races – at Daytona, Sebring, the Nürburgring, Spa-Francorchamps, Road Atlanta and Interlagos. The winner of each race picked up a cheque for 2,400 US dollars, while the second-placed team received 1,200 US dollars. The third-placed drivers shared 600 US dollars. The first name to go into the list of winners was that of Team Redline at the start of the year. Back in January, Maximilian Benecke and Maximilian Wenig were the dominant force in the BMW SIM 120 Cup at Daytona. Benecke is the first driver ever to pass the magical ‘iRating’ of 11,000. The ‘iRating’ is the evaluation system on the iRacing platform, based on performance and reliability. At the start of March, it was the turn of Coanda Simsport at Sebring. Victory for Mitchell deJong (USA), last year’s overall winner at the BMW SIM LIVE event, and Josh Rogers (AUS) saw them secure their tickets to the grand finale. Two months later, Laurin Heinrich and Alexander Voß (both GER) from the BS+COMPETITION team called on their wealth of experience at the virtual Nürburgring to win round three of the season. Shortly before that success, the same duo had also triumphed in the iRacing 24-hour race at the Nürburgring alongside BMW works driver Philipp Eng (AUT). Williams Esports is another of the top teams on iRacing – as demonstrated in the BMW SIM 120 Cup at Spa-Francorchamps. Agustín Canapino (ARG) and Sami-Matti Trogen (FIN) took the chequered flag in their BMW M8 GTE. That was followed by a two-month summer break, during which a new sim racing team from Finland appeared on the scene: KOVA. When the BMW SIM 120 Cup resumed at Road Atlanta, Tuomas Tähtelä and Valtteri Alander (both FIN) presented the newcomers with their maiden win. Red Bull Racing Esports emphatically left its mark on the season at round six, which took place at the São Paulo circuit. Sebastian Job first secured pole position. He then handed the BMW M8 GTE over to Graham Carroll with a significant lead. Carroll then guided the car home for a dominant win. “That was my first go in the BMW SIM 120 Cup – and we won at the first attempt,” said Carroll after the race. “It all worked superbly and the practice paid off. We now want to take this momentum into the BMW event in December and on into next year.” Twelve of the top iRacing stars will now go head to head at BMW SIM LIVE on 5th December.

With the BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04, the BMW Group is presenting the near-series version of the BMW Motorrad Concept Link at #NEXTGen 2020. As a link between the analogue and digital worlds of the user, the BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04 is both a means of transport and a means of communication for the urban commuter. With its electric drive, trailblazing design and innovative connectivity solutions, it sets out to redefine the scooter segment.The electrically powered BMW Motorrad Concept Definition CE 04 has been consistently developed and adapted to meet the everyday needs and requirements of the customer. True to the motto \"Plugged to life\" it combines the customer’s analogue world with the digital one. In conjunction with the corresponding intelligent rider equipment, a holistic, highly emotional and newly conceived mobility experience is created.\"Electric mobility is a central drive system for the BMW Group and we are consistently relying on this technology in our sustainability strategy. Electric drives are also a current topic for BMW Motorrad, especially for the urban environment. Since 2013, we have been a pioneer in this area with the BMW C evolution scooter. The BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04 is the logical continuation of the electromobility strategy for urban conurbations and provides a concrete preview of what a contemporary production vehicle could look like, with which we will take two-wheel electric mobility in metropolitan areas to a new level, both technically and visually,\" explains Edgar Heinrich, Head of Design at BMW Motorrad.The segment-defining design of the Definition CE 04 stands for a new, urban aesthetic. While the BMW Motorrad Concept Link in 2017 still seemed like a vision far from the future, the BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04 in 2020 transfers the radical design of the Concept Link to production readiness with almost unchanged design.\"We have managed to transfer many innovative elements and details of the concept into the series. The technical realities of electric drive – such as the flat energy packs in the underfloor and the compact drive train – allow us to create a highly distinctive design which defines a new, urban aesthetic and which differentiates itself clearly from conventional styling. A design that follows the basic needs for simple functionality, clear aesthetics and the digital reality today’s users live in. The new architecture has led to a visual revolution and has produced many new design themes. Maybe it will polarise, but it will definitely stand out,\" continues Alexander Buckan, Head of Vehicle Design BMW Motorrad.Visually, the BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04 clearly breaks with the look of scooters as we know them. Instead, an elongated, low vehicle body and the diagonally rising front end create a silhouette that is as modern as it is clear. The generous, calm surface design with sharply defined edges blends perfectly into modern, urban surroundings. The flat battery in the underbody provides new freedoms, such as the new storage solution, which is illuminated and can be folded open from the side. It gives the rider easy access for storing a helmet and other equipment. In addition, the low position of the flat battery provides a favourable centre of gravity, which ensures playful handling and dynamic riding fun. Clear lines, generous surfaces and distinctive design underline the modern impression of the proportions. This is further enhanced by the use of two colours: beneath the modern surface finish in Mineral White metallic, a matt black area forms the core of the vehicle, the technical heart. It stretches from the front to the rear and, in addition to the tyres and front lights, also integrating the drive unit and the suspension elements. The BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04 deliberately stages the bike’s technology as part of the design. That is why the side panels don’t completely cover the vehicle’s side section at the rear. Instead they stretch across parts of the vehicle’s side like little wings allowing views of the drive unit, cooling ribs, single-sided swing arm, spring strut and tooth belt.The design of the lights is as reduced as it is modern. The two U-shaped LED front lights are characterised by minimalist design. Their clear-cut layout and the slim contours accentuate the modern and trailblazing visual appeal of the front section. The rear lights have been integrated into the rear side panels in the form of two C-shaped light elements.“A scooter is not a “fun bike” which is taken for ride in the mountains in fine weather, but a practical everyday vehicle for driving from home to the office or meeting friends in the evening - simply a vehicle for every day in the city,\" says Alexander Buckan. \"That’s why we dealt intensively with the design of the drive and energy storage system in order to make it meet the needs of the actual user: The urban target group mainly rides short distances of approx. 12 km per day. Long-distance comfort is therefore less important than variable ergonomics and easy accessibility. In this way we were able to create a “floating” seat bench seat, which allows you to glide comfortably onto the vehicle even from behind. It also offers improved ergonomics for single riders, regardless of leg length and height.\"Both with regard to design and digital use, the BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04 always focuses on practical and user-friendly solutions. BMW Motorrad sees great potential in the interaction between vehicle and rider equipment in terms of safety, comfort and emotional experience. The rider is connected to his environment through his smartphone via the BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04. Its 10.25 inch display is the largest in the scooter segment to date and acts as an interface between the digital and analogue worlds of the rider.The designers have also broken new ground in terms of rider equipment: \"We deliberately wanted to create a fashionable look that is urban yet highly functional rather than classic motorcycle clothing. We want to develop products with which you can get off the vehicle and go about your everyday business hassle-free. At the same time, the rider equipment offers the protection you are used to from BMW Motorrad and even becomes part of the vehicle communication to the outside world\", explains Julia Lein, Head of Rider Equipment Design at BMW Motorrad.At the heart of the rider equipment developed exclusively for the BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04 is a casually cut warm parka suitable for everyday use. Black riding jeans, stylish sneakers and a white open face helmet complete the look. The parka in a broken white tone offers a high degree of wearing comfort thanks to its wide cut and is distinctive thanks to its urban style. The high collar and the large hood provide an even higher level of coolness. Details such as the positioning of the zippers or the discreet print emphasise the urban look, which allows you to go from your scooter directly to the office in style. The high-tech material of the parkas is waterproof, robust and breathable. The flexible protectors incorporated into the parka provide the safety expected from BMW Motorrad. Innovative features such as the integrated light guides in the sleeves and hood ensure greater visibility in road traffic and can be switched on and changed in colour via sensors in the sleeve. To ensure that the rider is always fully charged up, the inside pocket of the parka has an inductive charging field for the smartphone. The rider equipment is seamlessly integrated into the rider's life.The unobtrusive graphic design of the BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04 showcases the new concept to optimum effect. However, completely different design versions are possible here. Gerald Höller, graphic designer at BMW Motorrad Design explains: \"Thanks to the new architecture, we have created something completely new with this vehicle - and in the future we want to use graphics and colours to emphasise this even further. We see the CE 04 Definition almost as a moving screen with which a customer can express his personality - from modern elegant to urban.”Following the BMW Group's sustainability strategy, BMW Motorrad also aspires to consistently pursue electromobility. With the Concept e, BMW Motorrad already showed in 2011 what electromobility can look like in the urban environment. This was followed by the first prototype of the BMW C evolution in London, which was presented during the Summer Olympics in 2012. BMW Motorrad was the first-ever manufacturer in the premium segment to launch the series-production vehicle C Evolution in 2014, which made daily commute to work on two wheels purely electric. But that was just the beginning. For the successor model, designers and developers were given a free hand. The result: a completely new architecture and iconic design. With the BMW Motorrad Concept Link, the brand has already shown what the future of emission-free, urban single-track mobility can look like. The BMW Motorrad Definition CE 04 now continues BMW Motorrad's electromobility strategy for urban conurbations and thus provides a concrete preview of what a contemporary production vehicle could look like.You will find further press material on BMW motorcycles and BMW Motorrad rider equipment in the BMW Group PressClub at https:\/\/www.press.bmwgroup.com\n"}

Already since it’s second edition in 2018, BMW Group is partnering with Art D’Egypte. The fourth edition has recently been announced and will run under the topic “Forever Is Now”. It is set to be the first international art exhibition in history taking place at the Pyramids of Giza Plateau and starting on October 23, 2021. Art D’Egypte is held under the auspices of the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as under the patronage of UNESCO.Since 2017, Art D’Égypte has organized annual exhibitions with the long-term view of promoting Egyptian contemporary art. The aim has been to support young and emerging artists as well as to call attention to Egypt’s modern and contemporary art scene. While linking the event to the country’s cultural and historic heritage, Art D’Égypte wants to highlight the diversity and richness of Egyptian art over the centuries. In a departure from its previous exhibitions, Art D’Égypte is inviting international as well as local artists to participate in “Forever Is Now”. This will be the first time in the 4500-year history of the Giza Plateau that contemporary artists from all around the world are invited to showcase their work juxtaposed with the monumental backdrop of the Great Pyramids of Giza. Participating artists are to be announced over the course of the next year.“I have always been in awe of this extraordinary ancient civilization that has influenced generations with discoveries in the sciences, arts, math, social justice, cultural development, and innovation,” said Nadine A. Ghaffar, French-Egyptian founder of Art D’Égypte. “It is a civilization that managed to invent and build monuments that we as human beings to this day cannot fathom and have not been able to replicate. Egyptian culture is a gift to humanity, and the purpose of this exhibition is to showcase these treasures in a dialogue with the contemporary on an international scale, to the rest of the world. Ancient Egypt has influenced artists from around the world, and so we bring the world to Egypt and Egypt to the world through art. It’s a privilege to stand at the foot of these monuments that have survived turmoil, wars, and pandemics, and have endured. This exhibition is a token of hope for humanity and a humble tribute to a civilization that stands the test of time.”“Forever Is Now” is an international art exhibition that both reflects the profound, global influence of ancient Egypt and draws on the ongoing inclusiveness of contemporary cultural practices. Whether practiced by ancient Egyptians or by contemporary artists, the making of art permits one generation to bear witness of the present and speak to the next. It is an unrelenting undertaking that reflects humankind’s enduring talent for creating works that inspire the imagination, works that reveal the wonder of humanity itself, its tenacity and, through the arts, its unity. “Forever Is Now” will be cross-cultural and will showcase how ancient Egypt has been a monumental source of inspiration for artists throughout history.The exhibition represents a merging of ancient heritage and contemporary art at the oldest and last remaining of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, which today survives as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The exhibition involves some of the world’s leading experts and institutions, with centuries-worth of experience and knowledge on Egyptology, the archaeological history of the plateau, and the ancient history of the Great Pyramids of Giza and have hosted some of the strongest international and regional art exhibitions.The 2021 edition of Art D’Egypte, “Forever Is Now”, will also incorporate a Cultural Awareness Program that has already been launched in October 2020 at the Giza Plateau. The program aims to involve the surrounding community in the process of putting together this show and includes free UNESCO-led public lectures to train youth as Art Guides and Heritage Guardians for the duration of the exhibition. The program is under the auspices of Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and under UNESCO patronage. \n"}

A BMW driver claimed the drivers’ title six times: Volker Strycek in 1984 (GER), Eric van de Poele in 1987 (BEL), Roberto Ravaglia in 1989 (ITA), Bruno Spengler in 2012 (CAN), and Marco Wittmann in 2014 and 2016. Since the DTM comeback in 2012, BMW has completed 140 races and celebrated more than 40 wins. The manufacturers’ title went to Munich (GER) in 2012, 2013 and 2015. Reactions to the 18th DTM race of the 2020 season. Jens Marquardt:“We are all getting a bit nostalgic after the final race of the Class 1 era in the DTM. Since our DTM comeback in 2012, we have enjoyed some fantastic times at BMW Motorsport, celebrating numerous titles and wins together. Unfortunately, the 2020 season did not go as we had hoped – and the two final races at Hockenheim did nothing to change that. Nonetheless, I would like to thank the entire team for their tireless effort, the pure passion and readiness to battle right to the end and constantly give their all – after wins and defeats, this mentality is always what drives us on at BMW and allows us to overcome every situation. I would also like to express our appreciation for our DTM partners of many years’ standing and thank them for their loyalty and support, and the great collaboration in recent years. Personally, I will continue to follow future races as a fan of BMW Motorsport. Congratulations to René Rast on his third DTM championship title. He has made his made his mark on the racing series over recent years.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 16th, Race: 11th, Drivers’ standings: 9th, 95 points):“I had hoped to make up for earlier disappointment at the end of the Class 1 era, but unfortunately we weren’t really competitive over the whole weekend. With that in mind, I have to admit that I am happy that this difficult season is over. But I am also looking to the future with confidence, especially after the plans for the coming years announced this weekend by Gerhard Berger and his team. That all looks very promising. Many thanks to the whole team, and to RMG and BMW Motorsport. They deserve massive respect for completing this season despite the extremely difficult pandemic conditions. The past months have been very tough for them, with so many races close together. They didn’t even make it home between some of the races. We have all earned a bit of a break.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 9th, Race: 8th, Driver’s standings: 5th, 120 points):“Of course, it is a shame that the DTM as we know it is drawing to a close, but when one door closes, another opens. That is why we have to keep looking forward and wait to see what the future brings. It is little consolation that I completed the season as the best BMW driver, as it was not our aim to finish fifth. Audi simply did a better job this year, we have to recognize that. However, I am quite happy with my performance when I think back over the last year. I can only thank my guys and the whole RMG team. Everyone has done a great job in recent years, always providing me with a superb car. That is why I am wrapping up this season with mixed feelings.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 14th, Race: 16th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 51 points):“That was a season of ups and downs. My victory at the Lausitzring was a real highlight. Towards the end of the season, we were no longer able to build on that success. Nonetheless, I am thankful for this season and for the support from BMW Team RMG and BMW Motorsport. Now I am looking ahead with a positive mindset and looking forward to what awaits me.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 11th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 48 points):“This race marks the conclusion of what has been a character-building year for me. If I am being honest, not everything has gone well. In qualifying and during the final laps of the race, I attempted to enjoy every metre in the BMW M4 DTM. Who knows when I will once again be able to drive such a fast racing car. Many thanks to everyone from BMW Team RBM for three great years that have seen me make friends for life. Thanks as well to BMW Motorsport for giving me the chance to drive in the DTM. Now I am really looking forward to the career challenges that the future holds. I am still young and have a lot of plans for the coming years.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 5th, Race: 7th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 62 points):“That was a very tough race. Our competitors once again delivered a significant improvement compared to yesterday. I gave my all and scored some more points by finishing seventh, but in all honesty, that was the most I could have achieved today. Nonetheless, I would like to thank BMW Team RBM for their great support this season. I think that we looked pretty good during the final races, compared to our BMW team-mates, but of course I would have preferred to be competing for wins and podiums.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 12th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 108 points):“It has always been my dream to drive one of these fantastic cars in the DTM. I managed to do that for two years and celebrated my first win this season. That was very important for me. It’s a shame that the Class 1 era is now over. Many thanks to BMW Team RBM and to BMW Motorsport for their support. I feel right at home here.”\n"}

Jonathan Aberdein (RSA, CATL BMW M4 DTM) was the best-placed BMW driver in the penultimate race of the current DTM season, finishing in fifth position at the Hockenheimring. The result saw the South African driver move up two places to eleventh in the drivers’ standings. Robert Kubica (POL) from the privateer BMW customer team ART Grand Prix in eighth place and Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) in ninth and tenth were the other three BMW drivers to finish in the points. Aberdein recorded the third-fastest time in qualifying but started from sixth position after the imposition of a grid penalty and was unable to break out of the back end of the field for a long period. However, a safety car period shortly before the end of the race gave him the opportunity to leap forward. He crossed the line in sixth position and then moved up once more to fifth after a penalty for Mike Rockenfeller (GER \/ Audi). Aberdein now has 56 points and moves up from 13th to eleventh place in the drivers’ standings. Things looked promising for some time for van der Linde, who stayed in touch with the leaders after starting fourth on the grid, but fell back towards the end of the race. Eng defended his top-ten position for the duration of the race, crossing the finish line in ninth place. Lucas Auer (AUT, BMW Bank M4 DTM) took the chequered flag in twelfth. The race was over for Marco Wittmann (GER, Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM) after a collision at the very start. Timo Glock (GER) also suffered some bad luck: he was forced to retire his iQOO BMW M4 DTM just before the end. Reactions to the 17th DTM race of the 2020 season. Jens Marquardt:“You have to say, that was an eventful race. After the cold temperatures in qualifying this morning, we were actually in a pretty good position with the cars in fourth, fifth and sixth. But you could see at the start of the race; we knew it would be a real battle to keep the tyres going. I feel really sorry for Jonathan Aberdein and Sheldon van der Linde, because they deserved a better result than finishing in fifth and tenth places. Of course, it’s positive that we were able to get Philipp Eng over the line in between them, but the safety car did shake things up. Put simply, you can see that it is difficult to keep the tyres warm when the temperatures are cold. That is why we did as well as we could here. We have to try to finish higher up in qualifying tomorrow. Then we’ll go full throttle again.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 14th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 8th, 95 points):“I had a good start and was able to move up by two or three places before turn one. Then I got hit on the left from behind. That spun me to the left and I smacked into the barrier with Harrison Newey. The contact was totally unexpected. I will have to take a look at the TV recording first to see what happened, but of course, it’s a real shame that my race finished so early.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 13th, Race: DNF, Driver’s standings: 5th, 116 points):“The start went really well and I moved up two places. After the restart, I even made it to the top six. I was feeling good to start with, but then my tyres deteriorated pretty quickly. The tyres meant that my car just wasn’t really balanced. I had so much graining that I was unable to do anything and the second set of tyres didn’t make any difference at all. That was the same set of tyres we’d used in qualifying, which unfortunately just didn't work out at all. We had no grip at all for the whole stint. Then the car started to pull heavily to the left at the front and really didn't want to turn, especially going into the right-handers. Then the car was really pumping on the brakes, and at some point I was just unable to slow down in the Sachs turn, so I went straight into the gravel trap.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 16th, Race: 12th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 51 points):“In general, the last few races have been difficult. The balance was good in qualifying today, but we will have to take a close look at how we can improve overall. That was the penultimate DTM race with this generation of cars and I am trying to enjoy it all.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 5th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 47 points):“Qualifying was great, although I am easily the slowest car on the straights. We will really have to take a look at that for tomorrow, as the balance and setup of the car were perfect. I think that this was the best qualifying car I have had in this whole season. Of course, things were difficult in the race due to the top speed problems, even compared to my BMW team-mates. I think I did as well as I could have done. We made a superb strategy call at the end when I pitted during the safety car period – and we didn’t lose a single place.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 6th, Race: 5th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 56 points):“I have to say, that was a really interesting race. That grid penalty for me was very unfortunate and knocked me back to sixth position. There were a few tough moments in the race, which saw me lose a few places and I had to battle back. All in all, it was a strong performance. It was a shame that I lost two places at the end, as I think that a fourth-place finish would have been possible. Nonetheless, it was a good result overall.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 4th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 106 points):“There’s not much to be said about this race. The start went really well, as did the restart. I was in third place. Jamie Green then overtook me later in the race. Then the safety car made another appearance. After the second restart, it was like driving on ice. We will have to look at the data and I don't want to be too hasty in making any comments, but it is clear that something wasn't right. I had no grip at all. We fell back from fourth to tenth in two laps. In any case, we go on.” \n"}
{"prompt":"Through a cooperation with BMW i and Designworks, Austrian professional base jumper and skydiver Peter Salzmann fulfils the dream of flying in a most innovative way – electric drive and newly designed wingsuit increase speed and flying time – spectacular video documentation covering the maiden flight of the Electrified Wingsuit by BMW i to be presented during the #NEXTGen 2020. ->","completion":" Munich. Electric mobility by BMW i is conquering the third dimension. Within the framework of the #NEXTGen 2020, the BMW Group will present the first electric drive system for a wingsuit with which the centuries-old dream of flying can be realised in a completely novel way. The innovative drive module and the likewise entirely newly designed wingsuit were developed in a cooperation between BMW i, Designworks and the professional wingsuit pilot Peter Salzmann from Austria. His maiden flight with the Electrified Wingsuit by BMW i was visually captured in an elaborately staged video documentation. The spectacular film, which will be seen for the first time in the run-up to the #NEXTGen 2020, shows impressively how BMW eDrive technology is able to make a lasting change to the individual mobility experience – not only on the road. At the #NEXTGen 2020, the BMW Group will be showing in a variety of ways how the company is pressing ahead with the change in the global automotive sector. Initiatives and commitments will be presented, in which a close exchange with pacesetters from other sectors lead to new perspectives. In addition, the BMW Group will present the latest new products as well as innovative technological developments and vehicle concepts for the future of individual mobility.The main focus is on the technological field of electric mobility, in which the BMW Group with its development and production know-how and the largest choice of electrically powered drive systems is one of the world’s leading suppliers. Since the market launch of the all-electric BMW i3 in 2013, the components comprising electric motor, power electronics, charging technology and high-voltage batteries have undergone continued further development. The new BMW iX3 , features the meanwhile fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology, which is characterised by optimised energy efficiency and power density as well as an exceptionally compact design.Compact drive system, optimised design, unique flying experience. The long-term experience and the BMW i brand’s pooled development competence have now been utilised in a completely innovative way. The result is an extremely powerful, compact and light drive and energy storage package for a unique flying experience with the Electrified Wingsuit by BMW i. The fly unit of the Electrified Wingsuit by BMW i comprises two encased carbon propellers, so-called impellers, each delivering a power output of 7.5 kW, a speed of around 25,000 rpm and a total output of 15 kW, which is available for approximately 5 minutes. The design of the drive unit and the likewise exclusively developed wingsuit is the result of a cooperation between Peter Salzmann and the creative team from Designworks. The BMW Group subsidiary has strongly influenced the BMW i brand’s design from the outset, applying its creative capabilities not only in the automotive sector, but also on behalf of numerous international clients from other branches of industry.Around 3 years passed from the idea of a wingsuit flight with electric extra boost to the premiere in the Austrian alps. During this time the air sports pioneer Peter Salzmann and his partners at BMW i and Designworks worked jointly on the details of the suit and the drive system. The electric twin-propeller drive system including an energy storage unit were perfectly integrated into the front of the wing suit. The tests in the wind tunnel at the BMW Group Aerodynamics Testing Centre in Munich were a significant part of the development programme for the project.The jump from a helicopter, the flight with BMW eDrive technology, the landing with a parachute.The project Electrified Wingsuit by BMW i was triggered by Peter Salzmann’s aspiration to raise wingsuit sport to a new level. The 33-year-old Austrian is a skydiving instructor and has meanwhile also made base jumping and skydiving his profession. In addition to skydiving training and wingsuit flying, his repertoire includes film stunts and show appearances. When jumping from cliffs or out of an aircraft, Salzmann uses the textile layer stretched between the arms and legs of his wingsuit as a paraglider that allows him to generate a horizontal flight movement from the fall velocity and the airflow. With each metre of descent, up to three metres of horizontal flight can be achieved. Wingsuit skydivers can reach speeds of more than 100 km\/h.The aim of the electric drive system is to increase the performance of the wingsuit in order to achieve a better constant glide flight, thus allowing longer distances to be covered. Upon activation, Salzmann explains, the pilot experiences immediate acceleration, allowing them to fly at speeds of more than 300 km\/h. For the maiden flight with the Electrified Wingsuit by BMW i Salzmann was flown by helicopter together with two other wingsuit pilots over the mountain tops of his Austrian homeland. Directly after the jump from an altitude of 3,000 metres, all three flew in formation in the direction of a mountain massif. With the aid of the electric drive Salzmann accelerated faster than his colleagues and was able to fly across the peak in steep flight. After flying a further curve, he met up with the other two pilots who had flown in glide flight around the mountain. The three wingsuit pilots finally opened their parachutes and landed at the agreed destination.Following the successful premiere, Peter Salzmann and the experts at BMW i and Designworks continued their development work on the world’s first electrically powered wingsuit. The Austrian is firmly convinced that electric drive technology will shape the future, not only on the road but also in the air. To him, the project Electrified Wingsuit by BMW i demonstrates perfectly which previously undreamt-of possibilities can become reality with the help of electric mobility.https:\/\/www.bmw.com\/en\/innovation\/peter-salzmann-electrified-wingsuit.html?tl=grp-opre-ngpc-brnd-mn-.-.-.-.-\n"}

After this year’s Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) unfortunately had to be brought to an early end due to the coronavirus pandemic, it will have new appeal for the 2021 season. The BMW M2 CS Racing, the new entry-level car in the BMW M Customer Racing range, will compete in its own one-make cup on the Nordschleife (GER). The BMW M2 CS Racing Cup is set to replace the popular BMW M240i Racing Cup, which has been extremely successful over the years. The contract between the VLN and BMW M Customer Racing is for a term of three years. For the first time, two different performance levels of the car are eligible for the cup. Michelin is exclusive tyre partner for the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup. “I am delighted that we are now able to continue the tradition of an own BMW Cup class in 2021 with the BMW M2 CS Racing as the successor of the BMW M240i Racing. From the ground up, our new entry-level car, which BMW M and BMW Motorsport developed together, is far more of a thoroughbred race car than its predecessor. That is because BMW M GmbH provided a perfect basis with the BMW M2 CS,” said Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “To take full advantage of the opportunities provided by the racing version of the BMW M2 CS, we will have cars with two different performance levels for the first time in the history of the cup. This will allow Nordschleife rookies and experienced drivers to showcase their ability at the wheel. I am particularly pleased that, by concluding the contract with those responsible for the VLN, we are able to offer our customers planning security for three years. With Michelin, we have also found a strong and very familiar tyre partner for the same period. That is more important than ever in what is currently a difficult time for motorsport.” Martin Maffert, Michelin Motorsport Manager for the DACH region (Germany, Austria, Switzerland), said: “We are delighted to supply the new BMW M2 CS Racing Cup as exclusive tyre partner from the 2021 season. Michelin enjoys a long and successful partnership with BMW Motorsport. With the high-performance tyres on the new BMW M2 CS Racing, we will be doing our bit to ensure that we see exciting motorsport on the most demanding racetrack in the world.“ In addition to the total prize purse of 100,000 euro provided by BMW M Customer Racing for the top five teams, Michelin will also present a race tyre bonus to the top three teams in each race. this amounts to a total value of roughly 28,000 euro over the course of the season, thus making the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup even more attractive financially. A new feature of the cup is its division into two performance classes. The BMW M2 CS Racing can be run as both a ‘Permit B’ car with 365 hp and a ‘Permit A’ car with 450 hp. Therefore, the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup continues to offer Nordschleife beginners the opportunity to get their first laps under their belt on the way to ‘Permit A’, whilst at the same time allowing experienced Nordschleife drivers to use a more powerful variant to race at a higher level in the ‘Green Hell’. For ambitious racers, the 450-hp car offers a fluent transition to the BMW M4 GT4. The contract ensures that the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup is guaranteed for the 2021 to 2023 seasons. As well as the races in the NLS, the cup will also once again form part of the highlight of every season, the Nürburgring 24 Hours, including the six-hour qualifying race. As usual, however, the Nürburgring 24 Hours will not count towards the overall standings in the cup competition.\n"}

For nearly two months, the ninth awardee of the BMW Art Journey, Leelee Chan, represented by Capsule Shanghai, travelled across Europe to further develop her artistic practice. During this first part of her BMW Art Journey, an initiative of Art Basel and BMW, Leelee Chan visited Italy, Switzerland and Germany from August 28 to October 21, 2020. Now, the Hong Kong-based artist pauses her journey and is currently in the process of planning the coming leg of her trip to Mexico which she would like to take as soon as travel and health conditions permit.“It was such a privilege to be able to travel and complete the European leg of my journey in this ongoing difficult situation due to Covid-19. Connecting with all the artisans, scientists and other people making this journey possible was a truly incredible and eye-opening experience,” says Leelee Chan.In her BMW Art Journey “Tokens from Time”, Leelee Chan intends to trace material culture from the past, present and future. Chan interprets “tokens” as material objects and their respective historical development which represent the key qualities and feelings of living in societies across different historical and cultural contexts.In Italy, the artist visited a number of cities including Florence and Pietrasanta, where she attended workshops run by the sculptors Franco Cervietti, Nicola Stagetti, and other local artisans to gain deeper insights into the artistic manipulation of marble. She went on to Ravenna and Sicily to attend a class at the Mosaic Art School and to visit some of the world’s oldest and largest early Christian and Roman mosaics, which are recognised as UNESCO World Heritage. Leelee Chan then continued her journey to Agnone to study the processing of copper with the heirs of ancient family-run workshops, a path that led her to the 1000 years old bell foundry, the Pontificia Fonderia Marinelli.While travelling across Switzerland and Germany, Chan shifted her focus to the possibilities of future materials and the direct exchange with leading scientists and experts in the field of material science. She met Prof. Karen Scrivener at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale in Lausanne to learn about the making and impact of low carbon emission cement.As part of her journey, Leelee Chan also visited BMW’s headquarters and research centres in Munich as first BMW Art Journey awardee. There, she was able to exchange ideas with experts from the fields of textiles, glass, recycling and design. Beyond that she visited the Porzellan Manufaktur Nymphenburg and the architectural glass and mosaic workshop Franz Mayer of Munich, both traditional Munich enterprises. Chan will round up her research with video conference and a related exchange with the microbiologist Prof. Han Wösten from the field of “Fungal Biology” at the University of Utrecht. Through the artist’s numerous talks and visits to laboratories, the artist gained a deeper understanding of how engineered materials can play a part of a more sustainable future.Because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Leelee Chan decided to adapt her original travelling plans and to start her BMW Art Journey in Europe. She currently plans to travel further to Mexico to study the symbolic value and meaning of crystals in Maya culture and explore the traditional and artistic manipulation of silver. The further course of her journey strongly depends on the development of the pandemic and will be monitored closely and be adapted to respect the latest rules and regulations.Art Basel and BMW collaborate with the artist to document the journey and share it with a broader public through print publications, online and social media.For further information and press material about the BMW Art Journey artists and their projects, please visit the new press section: www.bmw-art-journey.com\/pressAbout Leelee Chan at Capsule Shanghai, ShanghaiLeelee Chan (b. 1984) lives and works in Hong Kong. She received her MFA in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) in 2009 and her BFA from the School of Art Institute of Chicago in 2006. Chan’s sculptures reflect her experience with the extreme urbanization in Hong Kong and are almost always comprised of dumpster detritus household ephemera, and mundane objects from her daily life not generally considered memorable or worth preserving. Derived from an impulse to interrogate these objects’ status and value, Chan imaginatively explores their transformative potential and reconfigures each item according to its unique qualities. Chan’s solo exhibition includes Capsule Shanghai. She has exhibited in recent group shows at Tai Kwun Contemporary, Hong Kong, and UCCA Dune, Qinhuangdao and Skulpturenpark Köln, Cologne.Leelee Chan was selected as ninth BMW Art Journey winner from a shortlist of three artists, represented by galleries originally accepted into this year’s Art Basel show in Hong Kong, during an online process. The international jury of experts included Claire Hsu, Executive Director, Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong; Matthias Mühling, Director, Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau, Munich; Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, President, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin; Philip Tinari, Director, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing; and Samson Young, artist and winner of the first BMW Art Journey. The next BMW Art Journey shortlist of three artists will presumably be announced in March 2021 during Art Basel Hong Kong.Launched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging artists worldwide. Now in its sixth year the initiative is evolving. Since 2020, the circle of eligible artists has been broadened. For the first time, eligible participants included not only emerging and mid-career artists from the Discoveries sector, but also artists represented by participating galleries founded no more than ten years ago. As this year's Art Basel show in Hong Kong had to be cancelled due to the outbreak and spread of Covid-19, the jury conducted its selection process online. Artists and their galleries were invited to submit digital applications, including a short video by the artists explaining their work and process. \n"}
{"prompt":"Spas, castles and museums, the Kurhaus with casino, the banks of the Rhine and the Rheingau vineyards: With the MINI Cooper S 5-door, a city break in the Hessian state capital Wiesbaden becomes a discovery tour of classical architecture, picturesque scenery and modern infrastructure.  ->","completion":" Munich. One million litres of water containing sodium chloride bubble daily from the springs of the spa town of Wiesbaden. The healthy effects of the warm thermal water with temperatures of up to 66 degrees Celsius were recognised there more than 2,000 years ago. Today, Wiesbaden is one of the most important spa resorts in Germany with more than 1.2 million overnight stays annually. But not all visitors are drawn there to drink and bathe. Besides its spas, Wiesbaden is also characterised by art and culture, historical buildings and its status as Hessian state capital. A sightseeing tour in the MINI Cooper S 5-door takes you past castles and museums, the Kurhaus and the Hessian State Theatre, the historic Market Church and the seat of the state premier.An ideal starting point from which to discover Wiesbaden is the Historic pentagon, named after a road layout created at the beginning of the 19th century. The MINI Cooper S 5-door moves with the brand’s hallmark agility through the narrow streets of this city centre, established as far back as the Middle Ages. The MINI 5-door, the first five-door compact car in the British brand’s history, is a prime example of the modern interpretation of creative use of space. Its wheelbase, a mere 72 millimetres longer than the MINI 3-door, not only provides considerably more leg room and a third rear seat but also increases the luggage compartment capacity by 67 to 278 litres.The MINI Cooper S 5-door passes numerous sights with long and eventful histories in Wiesbaden’s Historic pentagon. The Old City Hall, completed in 1610, now serves as a registry office. The Hessian State Parliament has been sitting since 1946 in the Wiesbaden City Palace which dates back to the 19th century. One of the most striking buildings in the Historic pentagon is the Market Church, also built in the 19th century, which visibly stands out in the old town centre not just with its five towers but also its brick façade.Beyond the Historic pentagon, several impressive buildings, characterising Wiesbaden’s image as a spa resort to this day, emerged in the course of urban expansion in the 19th and early 20th century. Taking centre stage in this city centre area is the so-called Bowling Green in front of the Kurhaus, a rectangular park which was modelled on the popular boules or bowling playing areas in France and Great Britain at the time.The Kurhaus and the casino it houses, the adjoining Colonnades on either side and the Hessian State Theatre building established Wiesbaden’s reputation as a chic spa resort early on, attracting famous visitors like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Fjodor Dostojewski or Johannes Brahms. According to records from the historic city archive, nowhere else in the world had as many Grand Hotels as Wiesbaden in the mid 19th century. Today, the architectural splendour of earlier centuries blends with modern infrastructure and a diverse mix of business, services and administration. Several film and media companies have located in Wiesbaden. The Hessian state capital is the seat of the Federal Office for Statistics and the German Federal Police Office as well.Trips beyond the city limits also reveal the attractiveness of Wiesbaden as a place to live. Heading south, the MINI Cooper S soon reaches the northern banks of the Rhine where the baroque Biebrich Palace is located in the midst of extensive parkland. The residence of the Prince and Princess of Nassau, built in the first half of the 18th century, now houses, amongst others, the Hessian State Monuments Office.Once on the move, the MINI Cooper S makes a wide loop around the city of Wiesbaden, leading to more day-trip destinations in the surrounding area. The spirited power delivery of its 2.0 litre 4-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology comes into its own above all on the country roads amid the Rheingau vineyards east and west of Wiesbaden but also en route to the Taunus in the north. The drivetrain generates a maximum performance of 141 kW\/192 hp and accelerates the MINI Cooper S 5-door from zero to 100 km\/h in 6.9 seconds.Those for whom a stroll in the vineyards or the Rhine-Taunus natural park turns into an extensive hike can then look forward to a relaxing dip in one of the many thermal baths. The entire urban area has a total of 26 thermal springs where the hot mineral water penetrates to the surface from a depth of approx. 2,000 metres. The city’s extensive thermal water network conveys the therapeutic water not just to the public spas but also numerous private bathhouses, mostly run by long established Wiesbaden hotels. \n"}

So from a personal point of view I’m very happy with my performance this year. I think we showed some very strong performances, we have been consistently in the top five, top six. My goal for the final round is clearly to secure P4 in the championship and if we have a good weekend at Hockenheim, I am sure we can achieve that.” \n"}

We present a profile of Moritz Löhner, Tim Jarschel and Leonard Krippner (all GER). ->","completion":" Munich. This weekend, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) will complete his second DTM season at the wheel of the Shell BMW M4 DTM at Hockenheim (GER). Last week, he and his team enjoyed great success in the virtual version of the racing series, the DTM Esports Championship. ‘Team Sheldon van der Linde’ won the team competition, with team member Moritz Löhner (GER) crowned champion driver. “I was really lucky,” said van der Linde, referring to his team. We present a profile of Moritz Löhner, Tim Jarschel and Leonard Krippner (all GER). Anyone wishing to be successful in the DTM Esports Championship had to be a real expert on the RaceRoom sim racing platform. At four racing events, the world’s best drivers went head to head in teams of four, each consisting of one professional racing driver and three sim racers, to decide who would be crowned champion. The title ultimately went to Moritz Löhner in the virtual BMW M4 DTM. He outperformed his rivals over the course of the season, and particularly on the final evening. Löhner’s reward includes a test in a professional race simulator and in a real GT4 car. His team-mate Jarschel was third in the Drivers’ Championship. “I was very impressed by my team-mates,” said van der Linde. “When the draw was made for the teams, I had no idea that I had two of the best RaceRoom drivers in Germany, in the form of Moritz and Tim.” Löhner has been driving for the Williams Esports team for just short of two years and, as well as in the DTM Esports Championship, also competed in the virtual equivalents of the ADAC GT Masters and WTCR on the RaceRoom platform this season. “So far, I have focussed fully on RaceRoom this year, due to the large number of championships,” said Löhner, who is also keen to stress his versatility on the sim racing scene. “At the end of the year, I will definitely be doing more driving on iRacing again, and I also regularly compete in big championships on rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa.” The 22-year-old is currently concentrating fully on sim racing, as that is how he earns his living. “Fortunately, it is working out really well at the moment,” said Löhner. “I am confident that it may be possible to earn even more money in sim racing in the future, because the amount of prize money on offer is increasing.” For that reason, he is fairly relaxed about his forthcoming test in a real GT4 car. “First and foremost, I want to have fun. If I am also able to establish contacts in the real motor racing scene, all the better.” Löhner has not yet given up on his dream of becoming a professional racing driver, like his team captain van der Linde. However, he remains very realistic about his future. “For me, the question of whether a career in real motor racing is possible is clearly a question of money. Judging by experience, I would either have to pay or, at best, drive for free if I were to switch now. However, that would probably mean I would no longer have enough time for sim racing and I would only ever give that up if I were certain that I could make a living in real motor racing.” Jarschel: “I hope there will be more series like this.”Jarschel, who has enjoyed success with the EURONICS Gaming team, has a similarly relaxed attitude to real motorsport. “I don’t really think about it,” he said. “It would obviously be cool to test myself in a real car, but I am not setting myself any definite goal in that regard. I’ll just see what happens in the course of time.” Instead, both Löhner and Jarschel would like to see another edition of the DTM Esports Championship. “I hope there will be more series like this – series that incorporate real motorsport as much as possible,” said Jarschel. Löhner added, “Having not had any DTM on RaceRoom for the past two years, I was delighted to have the opportunity again to drive DTM cars. It is great fun driving those cars, and the DRS and push-to-pass make for some really cool racing.” Krippner: “Compared to Moritz and Tim, I am still a rookie.”When it comes to racing, Leonard Krippner could still learn a lot from his team-mates. He only started competing on RaceRoom this season and is improving all the time as he looks to establish himself among the best drivers. “Compared to Moritz and Tim, I am still a rookie,” he said. Krippner is delighted with what he has learned within the team and in the fiercely-competitive DTM Esports Championship: “It was less about asking questions directly, and more about noticing the areas where the guys are better than me in our practice sessions. Above all, I still lack consistency when it comes to race pace.“ The DTM Esports Championship is the first major championship in which he has competed. With that in mind, his performances over the course of the season were impressive, including a third place on the grid for the penultimate race at the Red Bull Ring. “That was a big success,” said Krippner. “However, I then gradually dropped through the field in the race itself. That is partly down to a lack of concentration and consistency. It was valuable for me to see that I still have weaknesses, on which I need to work.” Van der Linde: “The likelihood of anyone managing to take that step is definitely greater.”As the professional driver and thus captain, Sheldon van der Linde was the face of the team. Although he was right up there with the best of his fellow professionals when it came to speed, he was unable to match the sim racers. He explained, “As so often in life, it is all about practice, practice, practice. The more laps you do in a simulator, the faster you are. With the series running at the same time as my real race outings, I simply did not have enough time to prepare with the same intensity as my team-mates.” Conversely, a top sim racer cannot simply take his place in a real race car and go toe to toe with the professionals. Having said that, there are an increasing number of so-called hybrid racers, who are successful in both a real and a virtual race car. Van der Linde likes this development. “It is nice to see that sim racers are increasingly being offered the opportunity to show what they are capable of in real motor racing. Obviously, you still have to be extraordinarily good when you are given that chance, and then you also have to get sponsors on board. However, the likelihood of anyone managing to take that step is definitely greater now.” Will Moritz Löhner seize the opportunity presented by his test in the GT4 car? “I will definitely have my fingers crossed for him,” said van der Linde.\n"}

MINI celebrates the superhero \"The Flash\" during Lucca Changes 2020, the new edition of the international fair dedicated to comics, gaming, animation and fantasy, taking place from October 29 to November 1st with a rich cultural programme only available online.“The Flash” is a superhero who, just like MINI, has a long successful story. A character that has been modernised and transformed, whose unmistakable traits have been renewed but always remaining faithful to its DNA.“The Flash” main characteristic is the super speed, faster than the speed of light, and this year we celebrate 80 years since his first appearance in the United States back in 1940 on the Flash Comics issue.The DC superhero magically and quickly appears on the new MINI Electric: two true icons of style, design and - without any doubt - speed that come together at Lucca Changes to tell the story of a car that collects many of the peculiarities of the DC Comics hero: full electric, no noise, highly performant and truly powerful.The author, Carmine Di Giandomenico, is one of the most known and active Italian cartoonists all over the world. He is very familiar with the scarlet sprinter, since he created more than 34 issues.“The Flash” by Carmine di Giandomenico is a runner that makes every page explode thanks to its dynamism while remaining loyal to the original character.Starting from the costume, Carmine di Giandomenico has drawn the scarlet sprinter and he has also made its own some peculiarities, starting from the speed. In 2016 he drew 56 comics tables in 48 hours (five hours earlier than expected). A unique accomplishment, typical of those who possess superheroes’ features, like the ones of the DC Comics multiverse that he knows so well, and which has earned him the nickname “the faster cartoonist of the world”.“The Flash” is a superhero with the ability to move seven-time faster than light, going beyond certain laws of physics. In the first character interpretation, “The Flash” is the alter ego of Jay Garrick who accidentally inhales heavy water vapours and becomes the fastest man in the world. He wears a red, blue and yellow costume, boots on his feet and a winged helmet on his head, just like Mercury.In the ‘50s, it is Barry Allen who plays “The Flash”, a chemist hit by a lightning while testing some chemicals. This incident turns him into a superhero with a total red costume who wears a mask instead of a helmet.The work done on the MINI Electric is a reinterpretation of the historical issue 123 cover drawn by Carmine Infantino, a version that is a merger between the classic version of “The Flash” (Jay Garrick), and its modern version (Barry Allen), becoming very popular thanks to different movies and tv series. In the background, just like in the original book cover, it appears the city where all “The Flash’s” adventures take place: Central City.Carmine di Giandomenico has combined a very plastic and dynamic touch with a prodigious speed - just like “The Flash” - completely designing the MINI Full Electric in just 10 hours and using a mixed technique.MINI’s tribute to “The Flash” at the Lucca Comics has been conceived in synergy with Panini Comics – that starting from 2020, publishes the DC Multiverse comics in Italy. The partnership has been announced during a digital press conference. It will be also shared on MINI, Panini Comics and Lucca Changes social profiles. \n"}

The 25-year-old succeeds Alexander Sims (GBR) alongside Günther. “Welcome Jake Dennis, to the BMW family and as a new member of the BMW i Andretti Motorsport team,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “I’m delighted that we were able to recruit a young, talented, versatile driver like him for our Formula E project. His performances in the BMW Motorsport simulator and during test drives in the BMW iFE.20 were impressive which is why we decided to offer him the cockpit alongside Maximilian Günther. Jake made a name for himself through his appearances in the DTM and with his podium finish in the Bathurst 12 Hours, among other things. He is also a simulator and development driver for Aston Martin Red Bull Racing in Formula 1. But our decision wasn’t based solely on whether someone has raced in the DTM or Formula 1. To be successful in Formula E with all its unique challenges, a driver must meet some very special criteria. We considered all of those and tested our candidates thoroughly with these in mind. At the end it was clear to us that Jake Dennis brings the perfect full package that we desire from a driver in Formula E.” Dennis contested the DTM for R-Motorsport Aston Martin in 2019 and, with a sixth place, got the best result of the season for an Aston Martin driver. In the same year, he secured pole position in the Bathurst 12 Hours (AUS) and finished in P2 in the race to make it onto the podium. He completed test drives for the Aston Martin Red Bull Racing Formula 1 team in 2018, where he is regularly employed as a simulator and development driver. With appearances and successes in Formula 1, the DTM, GT racing and single-seater racing, he has been demonstrating his great versatility for many years now. “I’m really looking forward to the new challenge that awaits me in Formula E, and would like to thank all those in charge at BMW i Andretti Motorsport for their trust,” said Dennis. “I’m aware that I will be confronted with unique requirements in Formula E, which I will need to get used to first, but versatility has always been one of my strengths, and I am confident that, with the help of the team and my fellow driver Maximilian Günther, I will quickly get my bearings. Formula E is one of those race series that, as a racing driver, you really want to be involved in at the moment because the level of manufacturers, teams and drivers is higher there than anywhere else.

The grand finale of the DTM Esports Championship gets underway at 19:00 on Tuesday evening. At four events, professional sim racers teamed up with six professional racing drivers to go head to head with BMW DTM drivers Lucas Auer (AUT), Timo Glock (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) in action as team captains. While ‘Team Sheldon van der Linde’ is currently in pole position in the title race, the event will once again feature a guest starter in the virtual BMW M4 DTM, namely hybrid racer Cem Bölükbasi (TUR). He follows in the footsteps of influencer Jimmy Broadbent (GBR), BMW works driver Beitske Visser (NED) and tennis pro Florin Mergea (ROU). Ahead of the final event of the season, we would like to present the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing guest starters. The grand finale of the DTM Esports Championship livestream: www.twitch.tv\/bmwmotorsport. Jimmy Broadbent: the Influencer.Jimmy Broadbent is not only an enthusiastic sim racer himself, but, as a YouTuber, also delights a community of more than 500,000 fans with his races and coverage of sim racing and Esports. He is an established name on the scene and a welcome guest in all virtual racing series. Broadbent had often worked with BMW Motorsport SIM Racing, even before his appearance in the DTM Esports Championship. His summary of his guest appearance in the DTM Esports Championship: “The sim racers who compete in the DTM Esports Championship are like aliens to me. It is incredible how quick they are and what they are capable of. I think I am pretty good in a simulator, but these guys are in a different league altogether. My community really enjoyed seeing how I got on compared to sim racers and the real DTM drivers. They were just as impressed as I was by the extremely high standard of the championship.” Beitske Visser: the female racer.For many years, Beitske Visser has shown that she is more than capable of winning races at the highest level. She demonstrated her talent again when she successfully progressed through the BMW Motorsport Junior programme and was promoted to a BMW works driver. Visser finished runner-up in the inaugural season of the W Series in 2019, which saw some of the best female racing drivers in the world go head to head on the same bill as the DTM. In 2020, she won the title in dominant fashion – not, however, in the real W Series. Her title came in the virtual W Series, which was launched as a result of the pandemic. Not only in that series, but in numerous others, she has shown that she is one of the best professional racing drivers on the sim racing scene. “I have always used a simulator to prepare for my real races,” said Visser. “However, during the pandemic I installed one at home and started to race online. It is something I really enjoy, and helps me to keep stay sharp.” Her summary of her guest appearance in the DTM Esports Championship: “I really enjoyed my start in the DTM Esports Championship at the Zolder circuit. The BMW M4 DTM is cool to drive. The standard of the professional sim racers was extremely high, but I had a lot of fun.” Florin Mergea: the tennis pro.Florin Mergea is not only an ambassador for BMW Romania and one of the world’s best tennis doubles players, but he is also a passionate and ambitious sim racer. As a tennis pro, Mergea has reached two grand slam semi-finals in doubles and won silver at the 2016 Olympic Games. He is now preparing for the Olympic Games in Tokyo (JPN) in 2021. During the current pandemic, he has taken his passion for sim racing to a new level. “Only in the last year have I started to invest more time in sim racing, due to the pandemic. Before then, it was just a pastime between tennis tournaments,” said Mergea, who this year competed in the Racing League Romania Season 5 powered by BMW. Since 2014, he has owned his own simulator at home, which he has consistently improved. Now, sim racing is more than just a hobby for the Romanian. “The mental aspect of sim racing helps me with my tennis, because I learn to focus fully for a longer time without the breaks that I get in tennis. That is something I would not otherwise practice so intensively,” Mergea explained. And he already has a vision for his future after tennis. “Once I call time on my tennis career, I can imagine getting involved professionally in sim racing.” His summary on his guest appearance in the DTM Esports Championship: “I have been an ambassador for BMW Romania since 2015 and have always been a fan of the brand so I was delighted to be able to try out the BMW M4 DTM in the DTM Esports Championship. It was great fun. For me, it was a fantastic experience to appear alongside professional racing drivers and sim racers in the same race.” Cem Bölükbasi: the hybrid racer.Cem Bölükbasi is at home in two different worlds – the real world, and virtual motor racing. Unlike Beitske Visser, whose involvement in sim racing is in addition to real motorsport, both fields enjoy equal standing with Bölükbasi. “I started out in real racing, until at a certain point I was no longer able to get together the budget I needed to continue,” said Bölükbasi. “That was when I started sim racing. It was in 2015. My professional sim racing career began in F1 Esports. Back then, I was the first person to sign a contract with a professional Esports team.” In 2018, he finished second in the F1 Esports world rankings. His success and activities on various social media channels allowed him to amass a large fan community. His YouTube and Instagram accounts have well over 100,000 subscribers. Despite his success as a sim racer, he has also been a regular on the real racetrack again since 2019. “The Borusan Otomotiv team gave me the opportunity to return to real motor racing and to compete in the GT4 European Series with the BMW M4 GT4,” said Bölükbasi. “They put their faith in me and said ‘Wow, that guy is good in the simulator. Let’s see what he can do in a real race car.’ I can only thank them for that.” Just last weekend, he claimed a class victory in the BMW M4 GT4 at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). Now he competes on Tuesday evening as the fourth guest starter in the virtual BMW M4 DTM in the DTM Esports Championship.\n"}

The MINI Countryman arouses the desire for adventure. The biggest model of the British premium brand has been designed with five doors and an interior compartment that can be used in a variety of different ways. This automobile is a true all-round talent and not simply in everyday traffic. Its robust vehicle concept, powerful engines and the optional ALL4 all-wheel drive ensure limitless driving fun even away from paved carriageways. And that’s not all. As a support vehicle in the entourage of the X-raid Team – currently the incumbent overall winner of the Dakar Rally – the MINI Countryman has already put in an impressive performance under extreme conditions a number of times, displaying dynamic performance and versatility. MINI fans are now also able to benefit from the experience of the successful offroad specialists. Chassis modifications derived directly from rally sport transform the five-door series vehicle into a MINI Countryman Powered by X-raid.A significant increase in ground clearance, particularly resilient wheel rims and tyres with higher flanks are prominent features of the upgrade for driving on challenging terrain that is now offered by the X-raid Team in Trebur, Hesse. These features were specially developed for the MINI Countryman and for outings on offroad terrain.MINI, the X-raid Team and the Dakar Rally – for a decade, this triad has represented exceptional success in motor sport. From 2012 to 2015, the X-raid Team achieved overall victory for MINI four times in succession in the editions of the classic rally held in South America. An additional overall success followed in 2020. This time the marathon rally covered thousands of kilometres through the sands of Saudi Arabia. The MINI Countryman Powered by X-raid is a truly authentic vehicle, epitomising not simply the flair of five victories in the Dakar Rally but also the technology that contributed to these triumphs.The X-raid Team is familiar both with the features of the MINI Countryman that are specific to the model and with the tough conditions besetting competitors and materials alike in endurance rallies played out on desert sand, rough terrain, mud and stony ground. The team’s know-how flows not only into the development and creation of winners in the Dakar Rally like the MINI ALL4 Racing and the MINI John Cooper Works Buggy but also into continuously optimised preparation of the service vehicles. This involved extensive modifications to the chassis and bodywork to make the MINI Countryman a particularly reliable support vehicle over race stages often extending along hundreds of kilometres.Increased ground clearance and measures to avoid flat tyres enabled the service vehicles of the X-raid Team to travel without mishap along tracks mined with potholes and strewn with sharp-edged rocks that are typical of the Andean highlands between Argentina and Chile, and on the rough terrain of the Saudi Arabian desert. Naturally, this means that the MINI Countryman Powered by X-raid is now well equipped for individual challenges on offroad terrain. Increasing the ride height of the vehicle and the large format for wheel rims and tyres raise the ground clearance for the MINI Countryman overall by up to 40 millimetres. As a result, the fording depth and the ramp angle are significantly optimised.The wheels developed specially for rallying provide effective protection against tyre damage. A robust rim ring ensures that it is not necessary to change the entire wheel if damage is sustained on rocky ground. It also creates a powerful visual impact and masks the high tyre flanks.The full scope of the upgrade, prices and availabilities can be found at offroad@x-raid. \n"}

After victories at the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring (GER), the 8 Hours of Indianapolis (USA) and in numerous GT races around the world, the classic endurance race in the Ardennes came to an early end for both Walkenhorst Motorsport cars. In the Pro-Am category, the Boutsen Ginion #10 BMW M6 GT3 crossed the line in fifth place. The Spa weekend had begun promisingly for Walkenhorst Motorsport. After setting good times in practice the #34 BMW M6 GT3, with Nick Catsburg (NED), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Philipp Eng (AUT) at the wheel, ended pre-qualifying on Thursday in first place. However, the BMW M6 GT3 did not cope so well with the difficult weather conditions in qualifying and both Walkenhorst Motorsport crews missed out on Super Pole. Both cars gradually worked their way up through the field in the opening stage of the race, but then Catsburg in the #34 BMW M6 GT3 collided with another car after about three hours, causing severe damage to the radiator and the front end. Catsburg returned to the circuit after a long break for repairs, but his race came to an end after 107 laps. The #35 BMW M6 GT3 – driven by David Pittard (GBR), Martin Tomczyk (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) – retired in the early hours of the morning after Tomczyk suffered a serious accident on the fast Blanchimont turn. Thankfully, the BMW works driver emerged from the incident without injury. In the Pro-Am category, the Boutsen Ginion #10 BMW M6 GT3 gave a solid performance to claim fifth place in its class. BMW works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) shared driving duties with Karim Ojjeh (KSA), Benjamin Lessennes (BEL) and Giles Vannelet (FRA) in the cockpit of the car with livery designed by artist Peter Halley. Reactions to the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps: Niclas Königbauer (Walkenhorst Motorsport Team Manager): “You have race weekends when everything goes well and then you have race weekends when a lot of things all go against you. We had a weekend like that here at Spa. There were some minor technical problems, bad luck and misunderstandings in the race, which then led to accidents. Primarily, I am glad that the BMW M6 GT3 is such a safe car, as Martin Tomczyk’s accident was pretty bad. From a sporting point of view, we are unhappy with how it went at Spa. We put a lot of work into the preparations and of course we were hoping for a different result. Nonetheless, this event is still one of the highlights of our season and we are already looking forward to competing again with the BMW M6 GT3 in the Intercontinental GT Challenge, at Kyalami in December.” Nick Catsburg (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, DNF): “It was a really unfortunate situation that led to my accident. We were in a group of cars and the one in front of me unexpectedly started to go very slowly. I hit it hard and damaged the front of our BMW M6 GT3 very badly. I think that I may not have gauged the situation correctly at that moment in time. I am very sorry about that for the whole team. For me personally, this marks the end of a series of very successful races but I hope that we will be able to go back on the attack at Kyalami.” Martin Tomczyk (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, DNF): “The conditions were very treacherous. It had started to rain again after the safety car restart in the early hours of the morning. We only had a halfway-dry racing line and it was very slippery outside of that. I lost the rear end a bit on the way into Blanchimont, so I had to open up the steering and went over onto the wet part of the track. From that point on, I had no chance. Luckily, I wasn't injured but the car was very badly damaged. That is a great shame for the whole Walkenhorst team, especially as the team’s other car had already retired early.” Jens Klingmann (#10 BMW M6 GT3, Boutsen Ginion, 5th place Pro-Am class): “Together with the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps is the toughest and the most wonderful event for a GT racer. I had a huge amount of fun during my ten hours in the cockpit on my debut in the Pro-Am category. We had some problems with tyre damage that knocked us back a bit but, all in all, the team and my driving team-mates did a super job.”\n"}

They borrow from famous models such as the BMW R 5 both technologically and visually, shifting the focus back onto the motorcycle essentials: purist, no-frills technology and the boxer engine as the epicentre of riding pleasure, combined with “good vibrations”. What is more, classic design is merged in the R 18 Classic and R 18 with clear-cut yet contemporary technology to create a fascinating overall concept – offering a riding experience that is as cultivated as it is emotional.The centrepiece of the new BMW R 18 Classic and R 18 is a completely newly developed two-cylinder boxer engine – the “Big Boxer”. Both its impressive appearance and its technology reflect a continuation of the traditional air-cooled boxer engines that have offered an inspiring riding experience for more than seven decades, ever since BMW Motorrad began production in 1923. The most powerful two-cylinder boxer engine ever used in motorcycle series production has a displacement of 1 802 cc. The peak output is 67 kW are designed in such a way that they are located outside the oil chamber, making them very easy to change.The BMW Motorrad equipment range offers a maximum selection of individualisation options with which to adapt the R 18 Classic and R 18 to personal taste and preferences. The wide range of different parts available from the programme of Original BMW Motorrad Accessories enables individual conversions that significantly alter the character of the R 18 Classic and R 18. For the market launch of the new R 18 Classic and R 18, two different design collections of milled aluminium parts are available, created in collaboration with Roland Sands Design: “Machined” and “2-Tone-Black”.For the accessories and customising programme of the new R 18, BMW Motorrad is collaborating not just with Roland Sands Design but also several well-known suppliers, including US manufacturer Mustang Seat in order to be able to offer different versions of high-quality hand-made seats.

In his final race for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Eugene Laverty (IRL) crossed the line in twelfth place. In the Superpole race on Sunday morning, Sykes and Laverty finished in eleventh and 16th positions. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has already started preparations for the upcoming season. The team will complete a day of testing at the ‘Circuito do Estoril’ on Monday. Quotes after race two at Estoril. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Our results at the Estoril finale were not satisfactory. However, I am glad that we once had a weekend without technical issues and without any crashes. In terms of performance, we are not where we want to be. We are not far off the top five or top six, but we have to work on claiming these results consistently. I would like express my heartfelt thanks to Eugene. It was also a difficult season for him but we have still been able to benefit from his work and made progress with him for example in the electronics area. Now we have to focus on next season. That will start in just a few hours with preparations for tomorrow’s testing. We hope to find those few tenths of a second there that will help us to improve.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First of all, thanks to Eugene. It’s been a tough year for him and with the season cut short, it made his job even more difficult. We thank him for all his efforts and contributions to the team and wish him good luck for next year wherever he goes. On Tom’s side, this weekend has been a struggle. The grip levels have been difficult for us and it has taken us too long to overcome that and find an optimum setting that works. Finishing 20 seconds off the winner certainly isn’t where we want to be but we got a lot of data to move forward. Our new season starts now and we’ve got to put 2020 behind us for many reasons, Covid, difficult conditions at all rounds, we haven’t scored a podium once this year but, however, we remain confident that we can set the wheels turning very soon with the BMW M 1000 RR and overall, we will push hard to be further up the grid. I think it’s fair to say that it was a challenge for most teams. Congratulations to Kawasaki and Jonathan Rea and let’s hope that next year we can be close to those guys and be on the podium more regularly.” Tom Sykes: “It was a pretty frustrating final weekend. Clearly we have some limitations with the package and saw already at the Barcelona test and here again that we come to a new circuit, arrive at a lap time and try a lot with big changes, we’ve had three different set-ups here this weekend, and we still arrive at that lap time and still have the same issues. The team have work to do and I am definitely looking forward to getting some new components. Now it’s time for closure on this year and hopefully the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team can make some good steps forward as soon as possible in the winter break.” Eugene Laverty: “This weekend as a whole has been very difficult here at Estoril. From the first practice, it was clear that with so many slow corners it was not suited to our bike, but we never gave up and worked hard. The good thing was that we did make progress in today’s race as our pace was stronger than yesterday’s so we can be satisfied we moved forward. Throughout our season, we made progress, especially in the latter part of the year. Most notable was Magny-Cours with our pole position, but unfortunately the season has been short with only eight rounds as I would have liked to be longer on the bike. The season for us is now over and it’s time for me to start thinking about 2021.” \n"}

I am delighted that the hard work of our privateer customer team has been rewarded with this third place as we approach the end of the season. Like Robert Kubica, Timo Glock drove a faultless race and finished fourth to score some important points in the drivers’ championship. Apart from that, it was a disappointing race for us, even though Sheldon van der Linde and Marco Wittmann did score points by finishing seventh and eighth. We will have to take another careful look at the accidents involving Jonathan Aberdein, Philipp Eng and Lucas Auer. The crucial aspect is that Philipp Eng made it out of his car without injury. Many thanks to the Zolder track marshals who reacted extremely well to the fire on his car. We will do everything in our power to round off the season at Hockenheim with a highlight.” Robert Kubica (#8 BMW M4 DTM, privateer BMW customer team ART Grand Prix, 3rd place):“This is a great moment for the entire ART Grand Prix Team after a difficult season. We had a lot to learn and needed to improve in many areas. Everything worked really well today. We managed to steer clear of all the problems and took our chances. We had really good pace in the decisive stages of the race. The tyres were an important factor today, so I didn’t push too hard after my pit stop and tried to keep them alive. I was able to build up a lead over the cars behind me and get home in third place.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 15th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 95 points):“It was a tough weekend for me. Unfortunately, our pace was not competitive. I wasn't able to get going in qualifying or in the race. I hope that things will look better for the finale at Hockenheim.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 14th, Race: 4th, Driver’s standings: 5th, 116 points):“That was a crazy race. Almost half of the starting field was out by the time we had completed about eight laps. I just concentrated on steering clear of all the incidents and managing the tyres. That worked well and I am pleased with fourth place, although I would have preferred to have reached the podium, of course. At the same time, I am delighted for Robert. He has earned this podium as he drove a great race. He has made progress race by race and his hard work has now been rewarded.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 13th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 51 points):“A disappointing race. There was a big crash in the opening stages and then there was contact between me and Philipp Eng after the Indy restart. My race was over after that. We just have to write it off. We want to go back on the attack at Hockenheim.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 8th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 45 points):“It was an unfortunate collision with Lucas Auer, there was nothing else I could have done. I took a hit from outside on the left. Hats off to the track marshals for getting the fire on my car under control so quickly.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 6th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 45 points):“My race was over early. There was contact between me and Fabio Scherer on the entry to turn eight. It might have been a misjudgement on my part, but I will have to take a closer look at it again to understand what actually happened. It was a disappointing end to what had otherwise been a good weekend.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 11th, Race: 7th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 105 points):“I had a good start and moved up two places on the first lap. After that, it was just chaotic, with two safety cars. I was able to hold my position but our strategy was blown. We tried to react to the two safety cars but the others were just smarter today.

Friday was all about getting to know the idiosyncrasies of the circuit, while Saturday featured another practice session, Superpole qualification and race one. In Superpole, Sykes and Laverty qualified in tenth and 14th with their BMW S 1000 RRs. Both riders lost places at the start of the race. As the race progressed, they both defended their positions but found it impossible to mount any attacks. Sykes and Laverty both move up after riders ahead of them retired from the race and after 21 laps, Sykes took the chequered flag line in tenth, with Laverty in twelfth. Quotes after race one at Estoril. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Firstly, congratulations to Johnny Rea. He has seemed untouchable on the way to his sixth consecutive world championship title - very well done! Up to now, our performance has not been satisfactory. Since the first practice session, we have been struggling to adjust to the new circuit. We seem to be unable to leverage our experience from the current season, with most of the familiar circuits providing little grip. We are simply not adjusting to new conditions and new circuits quickly enough at the moment. We will have to work on that for the future, but we have already developed the necessary methodology ahead of this finale. A positive aspect for us is that our lap times were stable throughout the race, however they were too slow to allow us to get involved in the battle for the top places. Not least because of that, we are looking forward to seeing what we can learn from testing on Monday. As part of the preparations for 2021, we will already be using some components for the BMW M 1000 RR to get an idea of the potential. But now we are focusing on Sunday: we are analysing the data from today to put on a better performance in the Superpole race and in race two.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Today’s Superpole was a bit disappointing. Tom was a few tenths away from a second row start but he could not get the full use out of the qualifying tyre. Eugene struggled getting grip from the rear tyre and ultimately could not post a strong lap time. The race was quite exciting at one point; we got into a good rhythm with Tom and he was bunched up in a group from 5th to around 12th, which was covered by a few seconds, which we felt we could have bagged a top six from that. Generally, we are not happy with a tenth position, but I felt his overall pace was promising and we took some good information away from that. Eugene continued his free practice and qualifying pace and circulated the race relative to those times, which was P12.” Tom Sykes: “We got a good start to today’s race one but I just got caught on the outside at T1. We then settled into a good rhythm and it was a shame as P5 was only a few seconds away, but I was at the wrong end of a big group. It’s clear to see that our bike is working really well in some areas, but I was just lacking a little bit today with mechanical grip and engine performance. But it is what is, the game is over for this year and now for me the aim is to get the best results possible and gather the information, blend that together going into the winter test and get to where we need to be next year.” Eugene Laverty: “This track is tough for us in general. These slow first gear corners are just not suited to our bike, but I did what I could today. We were slow but at least we were consistent and kept within three tenths of my lap time from the start. Regardless of that we gained some good information, I played around with my body position to try give the guys some direction to work in so again we will try something else for tomorrow’s final two races. Our problem is that we are struggling to get the bike stopped and have that punch out of the corners. But we have some ideas, it’s not going to be a miracle overnight but we must make progress.” \n"}

I’m delighted to be able to present the incredible complexity of a major corporation like BMW in some areas at least in my video clips, and hope that fans will enjoy watching the clips just as much as I enjoyed making them.” Glock is in familiar motorsport territory in episode one, presenting the BMW Motorsport simulator, but in the coming weeks and months he will dive into areas of series production, which will open up new horizons for him and hopefully for the viewers as well. The videos will be available on various BMW Group channels, as well as on Timo Glock’s social media platforms.\n"}
{"prompt":"The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is ready for the season finale. This coming weekend (16th to 18th October) sees the eighth and final round of the FIM Superbike World Championship 2020 in Estoril, Portugal. After the double pole at Magny-Cours (FRA), the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK team, with riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Eugene Laverty (IRL), is eager to end the season with further highlights. ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is ready for the season finale. This coming weekend , is eager to end the season with further highlights. In the wake of changes due to coronavirus, Estoril was added to the 2020 WorldSBK calendar for the season finale. The ‘Circuito do Estoril’ is located around 30 kilometres outside the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. While WorldSBK has been there twice before, that was back in 1988 and 1993 which makes the track practically uncharted territory for the teams and riders. BMW Motorrad Motorsport was able to gain their first experience there recently however, with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team at the season finale of the FIM Endurance World Championship, which was also held at Estoril at the end of September. Quotes ahead of the season finale at Estoril. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We’re really looking forward to Estoril already, where we will contest the final races of this unusual, reduced season. This season hasn’t been an easy one for us, but recently we have noticed a clear trend in the right direction. In Barcelona both Tom and Eugene got their best results of the season to date. That was followed by a strong Superpole at Magny-Cours, where Eugene and Tom secured the front two spots on the grid. We’re confident that results close to the podium would have been possible again in the races if the accident at the start of race one hadn’t influenced our entire race weekend. Now we want to continue this upward trend in the finale. We got to know the characteristics of the ‘Circuito do Estoril’ a few weeks ago in the FIM EWC. While we can’t transfer the insights we gained with the endurance version of our BMW S 1000 RR to the World Superbike exactly, we do at least have an idea of what’s in store for us in terms of track characteristics. We will work hard to prepare with the basis of the EWC information and to head into the winter break on the back of a successful final weekend.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We’re heading to the final round of the 2020 WorldSBK season at Estoril. It has been a rollercoaster season. We’ve had a lot to contend with. I think Dorna and the World Superbike organisers have done a fantastic job to manage to get eight rounds in the championship. The venue of the last round of the season, Estoril, is new to a lot of teams. No one has tested there, however we have some feedback from the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team that raced there not too long ago and we think that that information can be useful. We had a difficult weekend at Magny-Cours which after Superpole was fantastic but we had a setback with the race incident in the first corner and struggled to get back on our feet all weekend. But we’ve left that behind us and will now prepare well for the coming weekend. According to the weather forecast, there should be good ambient temperatures in the low twenties and we are looking forward to the final races. Hopefully, Tom and Eugene can continue that strong Superpole perfomance of Magny-Cours and tail that into Estoril and we can have a successful weekend and round the season off on a high.” Tom Sykes: “I am very much looking forward to going back to Portugal and indeed to a new circuit, a new venue for myself. I’m looking forward to getting to grips with the Estoril circuit. It’s a track which looked certainly enjoyable and exciting on the television watching the GPs when I was growing up so hopefully we can go there and finish the season very well. We’ll be trying to get that result that we have been looking for this year. We keep working, we keep showing great signs of potential and hopefully we can get it nailed down this weekend for the whole of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. So the plan is to finish on a high and then start to work for the coming season given the amount of great information that we gathered this year.” Eugene Laverty: “I’ve twice raced at Estoril in the 250cc World Championship but it was so long ago that I’ll be treating this weekend like a brand new circuit. The final round of the season has crept up on us after a flurry of races in the past couple of months. We can be proud of our clear progress and it was great to reward the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team for all their efforts with pole position last time out. We’re been making strides forward lately and I’m confident that we’ll continue to climb up the rankings this weekend at Estoril.” \n"}

The BMW Group already applies 3D printing to production procedures in many areas – and BMW Motorrad Motorsport is also relying on this innovative technology with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. It enables fast and efficient production of new prototype components right at the circuit. These can then be tested on the BMW S 1000 RR before they go into final production in Munich or at supplier locations. It also means that smaller parts that are often not subject to intense stresses can be made on-site and then used in races. Normally, the process is that engineers develop new components, which are simulated on computers, manufactured in metal or carbon, installed on the motorbike and then tested on the racetrack. However, the 3D printing capability makes it possible to develop and test new components during race operations. BMW Motorrad Motorsport has a portable 3D printer that travels to each circuit in the truck and is then assembled in the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team pit area on race weekends in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). “This technology allows us to make improvements to the RR quickly and efficiently. The development of a WorldSBK bike is an ongoing process and it is often the minor details that make a motorbike better,” said BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “Behind the scenes, our engineers are always working on adjusting and optimising individual bike components, all within the framework of changes permitted by the regulations. We can use 3D printing to implement these at the racetrack, even during race events. We then take the acquired data and the subsequent analyses – combined with comments from the drivers or input from the mechanics working on the bike itself – and generate input for the development team. This input contributes to the emergence of ideas that can be implemented directly in existing constructions or in simulations and iterative processes that lead to new constructions, all of which are executed in CAD. The new components are printed as plastic variants and their functions and ease of installation are checked on the bike. This process is now much faster than when we had to wait until the parts were produced either internally or externally and made available for evaluation at the racetrack. It is also easier to evaluate potential touching with surrounding parts or restricted access than it would be on screen.” Another advantage is if an adjustment is required, it can often be made to the existing plastic part and then implemented in CAD. This process can be swiftly repeated as often as required, until the part corresponds 100 percent to the requirements. First, a ‘dummy print’ is created for the component which then can be directly evaluated and adjusted. “Normally, you have finished components that you have developed with calculation, construction and simulation, and which you then evaluate during testing or on race weekends. The risk is always that, as the complete package becomes ever more complex, errors in construction, difficulties with installation or access to the part can be overlooked,” said Bongers. “3D printing allows us to create parts quickly and cost-effectively, and to optimise this during the ongoing process. As soon as we have the part just as we need it, we send the final data to the workshop, which then manufactures it for competitive racing from a suitable material, normally metal or carbon.” An example from the WorldSBK double-header at Jerez (ESP) and Portimão (POR) shows how fast and efficient this procedure is. In Jerez, the linkage system of the rear shock absorber was optimised, based on the riding data. A prototype of the 3D-printed part was installed and tested. The final data was then sent to the supplier, who then used the data to manufacture a new linkage system between the race days. A few days later, in time for the start of the next race weekend at Portimão, it was available for installation on the BMW S 1000 RR. If smaller components or spare parts, which are not subject to such extreme stresses, need to be manufactured, the complete process can take place on-site with the 3D printer. Examples for such parts include adjustment levers, sensor holders and quick-release couplings. However, if the printer on site at the track doesn’t have sufficient capabilities, the options provided by the BMW Group’s in-house Additive Manufacturing Campus (AMC) are practically infinite. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is working closely with the Additive Manufacturing Campus. This channel provides the team with unique access to not only the advisory 3D printing experts, but also to a comprehensive range of printing methods and various materials for different applications. Manufacturing of the components can be triggered directly from the track, via BMW’s own systems. Examples of parts that are printed in plastics or metals directly for use on the World Superbike include brake ventilation in plastics reinforced with carbon fibre, complex moulded parts, titanium crash pads, aluminium distributor boxes and aerodynamic trim parts. \n"}

The BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth Club drew to a close with a final round that looked for much of the day as though it would go down to the wire. In the end, Tyrrell Hatton defended the lead he established on Saturday to win the European Tour’s flagship event ahead of France’s Victor Perez, who closed the gap to put the 2018 Ryder Cup winner under plenty of pressure at times on Sunday. “Congratulations to Tyrrell Hatton on his victory at the 2020 BMW PGA Championship. In many ways, it was a tournament unlike any we’ve seen before. While the electric crowds were not present this year, I’m proud that we were able to put on a world-class event for golf fans watching around the globe. We look forward to welcoming spectators back to Wentworth in 2021 for the seventeenth edition of the BMW PGA Championship,” said Graeme Grieve, Chief Executive Officer BMW Group UK.Hatton hit rounds of 66, 67, 69 and 67 on his way to his fifth win on the European Tour. With the weather making for challenging conditions in the third round, the Englishman managed to pull clear of the chasing pack and took a three-shot lead into Sunday. By the halfway point of the final round, he had seen this lead disappear, as Perez drew level. However, Hatton refused to let this knock him out of his stride. While he carded five birdies on the final nine holes, the Frenchman hit two bogeys.“I have been coming to this event since I was five years old. To go on and win the trophy is very special and it is a dream come true,” said Hatton after winning the biggest title of his career to date.Patrick Reed narrowly failed to emulate Arnold Palmer in 1975 and claim a second American victory at the European Tour’s flagship event. Despite this, the 2018 Masters Champion did successfully defend his lead in the Race to Dubai, the European Tour’s season-long standings, which he could become the first American ever to win. Reed finished tied in third place with Andy Sullivan, who fought back strongly with the best round of the day on Sunday was tenth. An opening round of 73 prevented the 35-year-old from achieving a better result, but the German did recover well to confirm his return to form.David Howell hit the shot of the tournament in the second round. The 45-year-old Englishman, who won the European Tour’s flagship event in 2006, saw his tee shot on the 14th hole bounce once before disappearing into the cup.

Marco Wittmann (GER \/ Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA \/ Shell BMW M4 DTM) also finished in the points. Sunday began with a successful qualifying for the BMW teams. Glock set the fastest time on a drying track to secure pole position. Van der Linde joined him on the front row of the grid and started Sunday’s race from second place, completing the best BMW qualifying result of the season so far. However, the race was packed with drama from the word go. Glock spun into a gravel bed after contact in the opening corners and dropped to the back of the field. The race then changed completely when a crash involving Robin Frijns (NED \/ Audi) was followed by a safety car period. The beneficiaries of that were the drivers who had already been in for their mandatory pit stop and were then able to gain positions. Those included Auer and Glock; Auer found himself on course for a podium finish, and eventually crossed the finish line in third place, followed by Glock in fourth. Van der Linde had led the field during the safety car period, but still had to come in for his mandatory pit stop. The same went for Wittmann, who also led for several laps after the safety car period. Ultimately, Wittmann finished eighth and van der Linde tenth. Jonathan Aberdein (RSA \/ CATL BMW M4 DTM) and Philipp Eng (AUT \/ ZF BMW M4 DTM) were eleventh and 14th. The eighth round of the season, with races 15 and 16, will take place at Zolder again next weekend. Reactions to the 14th DTM race of the 2020 season at Zolder. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“This weekend’s second race at Zolder was a real emotional rollercoaster. We had a great qualifying. Congratulations to Timo Glock and Sheldon van der Linde on the first all-BMW front row of the season. Unfortunately, the start did not run smoothly. We need to take a closer look at why our starts were not so good this weekend. The first lap was a bit chaotic, and Timo found himself way behind at the back of the field after a collision. The safety car then promoted our two cars that had come in early because they were well down the field. Towards the end, they obviously really struggled on older tyres which is why they were unable to attack the cars in front anymore. However, third place for Lucas Auer and fourth for Timo was a well-deserved result. After the safety car, the field was split in two. Marco Wittmann was able to hold his ground in the end, and managed to stay ahead of Nico Müller. We probably could have done better, but the conditions were the same for everyone. I think we gained valuable experience this weekend and laid a good foundation for Zolder II. The qualifying performance can stay as it was, but we are obviously hoping for a better start and a race without an appearance from the safety car. We will push hard again.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 10th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 90 points):“In a crazy race, which was mainly influenced by the safety car, I was basically the best-placed car that had not stopped previously so I can be really happy with my race and our pace. For me personally, the safety car was a bit unlucky. After that, there was not a lot more I could have done.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 1st, Race: 4th, Driver’s standings: 5th, 102 points):“It was fantastic to get pole position this morning. We timed it perfectly in difficult conditions. Unfortunately, my start was not ideal and I simply braked too late in turn one. I lost the car, hit Ferdinand Habsburg, and spun. In the end, I had a lot of luck with the safety car period, which allowed me to finish fourth. We can be happy with that, as the car was pretty damaged. On the whole, I think we laid a good foundation for next weekend.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 12th, Race: 3rd, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 51 points):“I am really happy for my guys and me. We are all trying our hardest and have had some fantastic highs this season, but we have also had some lows. I am delighted to pick up another trophy. The start was super, and I got away really well. Our pit stop strategy was the right one, and we obviously benefitted from the safety car. It all kicked off again at the restart, but fortunately it all turned out well. I am happy with the way we finished the race.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 15th, Race: 14th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 45 points):“That was a day to forget. Starting from 15th, I was under no illusion that we could achieve anything big. Our car was good, but the safety car came at an unlucky time for us. I was then given a drive-through penalty for an infringement at the restart. After that, the race was all but over for me. We must now move on from that and turn things around as quickly as possible here at Zolder next weekend.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 9th, Race: 11th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 33 points):“It was a very tough race again. I had a good start and was running in P6 but unfortunately we were unlucky with the timing of the safety car and that put us back to 11th place for the rest of the race. I think we definitely deserved more today but we take it on the chin, analyse and improve for next weekend.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 2nd, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 99 points):“Race two is done and it was very disappointing. The start was quite good and also the pace was strong. I was in P3, lost the position to Robin Frijns and was in P4 for a bit but I felt comfortable in the car. Unfortunately, the safety car came out which had major influence on my race as I lost a lot of lap time so it was very disappointing for me. I think there was a lot more points potential in it. But anyway, we’ve been scoring the last eight or nine races. We need to keep that up for the next weekend, feeling confident.” \n"}

Sheldon van der Linde (RSA \/ Shell BMW M4 DTM) and Philipp Eng (AUT \/ ZF BMW M4 DTM) also picked up more points. In a thrilling qualifying session on Saturday morning, Glock secured second place on the front row of the grid in damp conditions. The newly asphalted track was mostly dry by the time the race started. After position changes, Glock pulled off courageous overtaking manoeuvres once again, and was on course to finish on the podium up until lap 30 of 42. At that point he lost a position and dropped down into fourth, which he defended down to the wire. Van der Linde initially dropped from sixth on the grid to P13, but then started working his way up the field into sixth place. The result saw the South African maintain fourth place in the DTM driver’s standings. Eng in ninth also finished in the points.

We were very well-positioned with second, fourth, sixth and ninth on the grid, and improved our performance in qualifying considerably. The actual race wasn’t all that easy for us. You could see that we lost a bit of race pace and weren’t able to keep up with it for the whole stint. It’s a real shame that we only just missed out on the podium. Timo was so close, but his tyres just weren’t good enough anymore at the end. I feel really sorry for Marco Wittmann that he was unable to finish the race due to a gearbox problem. We need to look at things in more detail again for tomorrow to see if the strategies were right overall and then try to get everything out of qualifying while also maintain the pace in the race.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 4th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 8th, 86 points):“It was a disappointing day for me in the end. You can’t ever be pleased after a DNF. Recent weekends have shown that the cars are extremely stable which makes it all the more disappointing that we were unable to get any more out of today due to the technical defect. The transmission was stuck in fifth gear and I couldn’t change it which is why I had to return to the pit. While we weren’t able to be up there fighting for the podium, we would have been good points for P5 or P6. Now we are focussing fully on tomorrow.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 2nd, Race: 4th, Driver’s standings: 7th, 87 points):“For sure, I would have been happy to be on the podium but it was clear to me that the Audis would have strong race pace. You could see that already yesterday in free practice. But in general I’m happy with P4; we’ve scored some good points but against the top three we are not strong enough at the moment. They are very good in terms of tyre management and that is where we are still struggling and need to improve. Tomorrow, we need the car to be again in the top three in qualifying because here it’s very important to be upfront as overtaking is difficult. That needs to be the target for tomorrow.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 9th, Race: 12th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 36 points):“My qualifying was okay with ninth on the grid. In the race itself we pitted too late, which meant we were undercut a bit. To be honest, our pace wasn’t quite enough to get any more out of the race. We need to work on that and see that we make progress for tomorrow.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 11th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 45 points):“My race was exciting. I had a good start and a good first lap. We changed the car in a way that suited me much better than yesterday. Unfortunately, all the duels in the race meant I lost a lot of time. After I was overtaken off-track I got stuck behind Jamie Green for a few laps. Obviously that didn’t help us. Despite that I am pleased with the progress and hope that we will be able to build on it tomorrow.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 14th, Race: 11th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 33 points):“It was a really tricky race. It started already in qualifying when we qualified in P14 so we gambled on a safety car which I think was the best option from where we started but obviously it didn’t materialise so it was all about saving the tyres to the end. We will now try to analyse and make smart decisions for tomorrow.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 6th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 4th, 96 points):“It was an eventful first race for me. I made a really good start and gained some positions but was stuck in the middle into turn one. That was very tricky and I just tried to stay out of trouble but in turn two I was pushed off into the gravel so I lost many positions as I almost completely spun the car. From then onwards we changed our strategy on the go and we had really good pace in the second stint. I drove all the way up to P6 in the end so I am very, very happy with this recovery, for sure, but still a bit disappointed as it could have been much more today because we were really competitive in the race. We are trying to keep the momentum going for tomorrow.”\n"}

Those seeking variety and wishing to relocate every day can travel spontaneously and in style with a MINI Design-inspired sleeping area mounted on the roof of the 5-door all-rounder. Munich. Though the Mediterranean is still a long way off, there is certainly no shortage of cool waters in the northern Italian Lombardy region. Whether it’s the sophisticated Lake Como, or Lake Garda, a favourite with German visitors for decades: everywhere tourists are enticed by clear waters, light winds and the mountain panorama of the Alpine foothills. Lake Iseo is particularly popular with camping lovers. Here the sheer abundance of camping pitches located right on the lake makes it hard to choose the perfect place to spend the night. This is why tourists, wishing to explore in a short time as much as possible of the picturesque scenery and the scenic villages with little ports, pretty promenades and quaint restaurants, tour around in a camper van. Or in the new MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 . It offers considerably more driving pleasure on the narrow lakeside roads, is agile even on unsurfaced terrain and transports two comfortable places to sleep to locations which are out of reach for conventional camping vehicles.This is made possible by a roof tent specially designed for the MINI Countryman by the Italian manufacturer AUTOHOME. As a result, spontaneous relocations on Lake Iseo are a pure delight. The mobile shelter is the product of a cooperation with the MINI Design Team and is available in black or white, the same contrasting paintwork colours available for the roof and mirror caps of the 5-door all-rounder. Its special attachment system makes it easy to secure on the roof of the largest model of the British premium brand, on the optional roof rails and the roof rail carrier available in the Original MINI Accessories range. The solid fibre-glass housing of the roof tent resembles a roof box when closed, with its flat aerodynamically optimised shape reducing drag and wind noise en route to Lombardy.The new MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 effortlessly assumes the role of a camper van. Folding down the rear seat with its standard 40 : 20 : 40 split increases its luggage compartment capacity from 450 to up to 1,390 litres. This means that, besides the holiday luggage and sleeping bags, one or the other indispensable piece of equipment for stylish alfresco holidays can still be packed: whether it’s the camping barbecue for preparing a freshly-caught char from the lake or the espresso machine with connection to the 12-volt socket in the luggage compartment. Thanks to a maximum permissible additional load of 560 kilograms, it takes quite a while to reach the transport limits of the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4.Anyone looking at Lake Iseo on the map will notice an elongated \"S\" not unlike the letters affixed on the side scuttles and the radiator grille of the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4. And its agile drivability is also well suited to the landscape. On Lombardy’s winding country roads the premium compact model immediately demonstrates its sporty character, even with more generous vehicle loads. Its 131 kW\/178 hp 4-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo Technology, standard 8-speed Steptronic transmission and optional adaptive suspension guarantee a blend of camping anticipation and unmistakeable driving pleasure.You can drive right round Lake Iseo, situated between Bergamo in the east and Brescia in the west, on lakeside roads. Spectacular views of the water and mountains invite you to stop off along the roadside, whereas access to particularly idyllic bathing spots and camping areas is sometimes via unsurfaced roads. This is where the ALL4 all-wheel drive comes in handy. The instantaneous reactions of its electronically controlled system ensure the needs-based distribution of driving power between the front and rear wheels at all times in all road surface and weather conditions. Thus even heading for a place to spend the night that is somewhat off the beaten track but especially secluded is unproblematic.On arrival there, the advantages of the roof tent literally unfold in a few easy moves. Once the safety clasps on the housing are released, the tent is automatically raised by means of four gas pressure springs. Then, on entering the mobile accommodation, it is clear that the brand’s hallmark principle of clever use of space also applies on a MINI camping holiday. The equipment range of the roof tent includes a foldable aluminium ladder to climb up onto the top floor of the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4. Inside, the space measuring 2.10 meters in length and 1.30 metres in width provides a comfortable sleeping area for two on a high-density mattress with cotton cover. The LED interior light, doors and windows with zips and mosquito nets, storage nets and pockets clinch this top location overlooking Lake Iseo. And so camping becomes an individual holiday in typical MINI style.\n"}

The winning run of the BMW M6 GT3 continues. Just one week after its first victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER), a BMW M Customer Racing car won the 8 Hours of Indianapolis (USA). Walkenhorst Motorsport claimed a one-two in the second of four races that make up this season’s Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC). Nürburgring winner Nick Catsburg (NED) triumphed in the #34 BMW M6 GT3 alongside Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). David Pittard (GBR), Martin Tomczyk (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) came home second in the #35 car. The BMW M6 GT3 had already made a clear statement of intent in qualifying, with pole position for Catsburg, De Phillippi and Farfus, and third place on the grid for their team-mates. The race saw flawless performances from all the drivers, despite rain and some difficult conditions in the first few hours, and they soon established themselves at the front of the field. Changing track conditions made tyre selection tricky, but the team made all the right decisions. The fact that the opposition were struggling with issues meant that both BMW M6 GT3s were able to control the race in the closing stages and secure a memorable one-two. This was Walkenhorst Motorsport’s maiden victory in the team’s second full season in the IGTC. For Catsburg, who tasted success at the Nürburgring with ROWE Racing last weekend, this was a second win in a week. After failing to finish the season-opener at Bathurst (AUS) back in February, this victory puts regular drivers Catsburg and Farfus right back in the title race, along with team-mates Pittard and Tomczyk, who did not start at Bathurst. The highlight of the IGTC season – the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) – takes place in just a few weeks. The title will then be decided at the season finale at Kyalami (RSA) in December. BMW M Customer Racing teams also triumphed in the GT4 category. Bill Auberlen, James Clay and Chandler Hull (all USA) took victory in the #82 BimmerWorld Racing BMW M4 GT4. That rounded off a perfect weekend for Clay, who had previously wrapped up the Driver title in TC America with the BMW M240i Racing on Saturday. Second place in the GT4 class at the 8 Hours of Indianapolis went to the #438 BMW M4 GT4 of ST Racing, with drivers Jon Miller (USA), Samantha Tan and Nick Wittmer (both CAN). Quotes after the race: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director): “To have won a prestigious endurance race with the BMW M6 GT3 for the second time in just a week is awesome. Congratulations to Walkenhorst Motorsport on a commanding and flawless performance at Indianapolis. It was a pleasure to see the team and drivers do such a perfect job. Looking at the overall standings in the Intercontinental GT Challenge, this success was hugely important. I can now hardly wait to see the two Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M6 GT3s in action again at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps in just three weeks’ time. The Indianapolis success was perfectly rounded off by the 1-2 result for the BMW M4 GT4 in the GT4 class. Congratulations also to BimmerWorld Racing and ST Racing.” Niclas Königbauer (Team Manager Walkenhorst Motorsport): “We are overjoyed. It was a sensational team effort to claim a one-two here at Indianapolis after the 24-hour race. We obviously always dreamed of this, but to actually achieve it in this manner was really excellent. We did not make any mistakes, were strategically very well prepared, and the drivers and whole team did a mega job. I believe we fully deserved to finish first and second. We are pleased that BMW put their faith in us and that we have been able to pay them back with this success. I am now really looking forward to the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps and many more challenges.” Nick Catsburg (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “That was a very special week for me. To celebrate back-to-back victories at the Nürburgring and Indianapolis is simply fantastic. Thank you very much to Walkenhorst Motorsport and my fellow drivers. They did a perfect job. Augusto Farfus was magnificent in the rain at the start. He and Connor De Phillippi made my life relatively easy. I just had to bring the car home and secure the win.” Connor De Phillippi (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “The guys at Walkenhorst Motorsport are Nürburgring specialists, and they proved that emphatically today. After all, we had Nürburgring conditions here at Indianapolis. One moment it was wet, the next it was dry again. Tyre selection and tyre strategy were key, and the team did a virtually perfect job when some stages of the race were pretty eventful. Unfortunately, the safety car periods did not always play into our hands, and the Acura in third place was able to close in on us. When the track dried out, the BMW M6 GT3 got faster and faster and, when our rivals had their issues, we were able to control the race.” Augusto Farfus (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “That was a fantastic day. To win at an iconic venue like Indianapolis, just one week after the podium at the Nürburgring, is remarkable. We did not make any mistakes today, and so laid the foundation for this win. I can hardly wait to travel to Spa-Francorchamps for the highlight of the season.” David Pittard (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “I think our set-up gave us a slight advantage over the other Walkenhorst car on a wet track. You could see that, particularly at the start of the race, when Martin Tomczyk did a fantastic job in difficult conditions and handed the car over to Nick Yelloly in the lead. The drier it became, the more the balance of power shifted towards the #34 car. It is fantastic for the team to be able to split the strategy that way. It ultimately worked in favour of our team-mates, but on the whole it was a fantastic result for Walkenhorst Motorsport.” Martin Tomczyk (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “That was an exciting weekend. Congratulations on the victory to Walkenhorst Motorsport and our other car, with Nick, Connor and Augusto. The two cars were at almost the same level all weekend. In the race, however, the way the conditions developed tended to suit the other car a little more. Be that as it may, the one-two is a fantastic result for Walkenhorst Motorsport and BMW. We are one big team and will all celebrate together. We did that a week ago at the Nürburgring, and we will obviously do so again here.” Nick Yelloly (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “It was another great race and a great event. It was great fun to drive at Indianapolis. That is something I have always wanted to do. And then to claim a one-two for BMW, after Nick and I won on the Nordschleife last week – that is simply a dream week. In the end, we were not quite able to match the other Walkenhorst car, as we took different approaches in terms of the set-up. We were quicker at the start, but they really upped their pace when the track dried out. I am overjoyed. That is my second podium with Walkenhorst Motorsport and quite simply a superb performance from the whole team.” \n"}

After successfully qualifying in Superpole with the first 1-2 qualifying for BMW Motorrad on Saturday, the rest of the rainy race weekend at Magny-Cours (FRA) didn’t go according to plan for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. The seventh and penultimate round of the FIM Superbike World Championship 2020 (WorldSBK) drew to a close with warm-up, Superpole race and race two on Sunday. In the morning sprint race, both BMW riders struggled to get the tyres working properly in the right window; in the afternoon, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Eugene Laverty (IRL) finished in the points in tenth and 14th. The team worked long and hard to make the two BMW S 1000 RRs ready to race again after the accident at the start in Saturday’s race. Laverty started the Superpole race from pole position in the morning, with Sykes next to him in second on the grid. Both riders got off to a really good start, but then dropped down the field. Sykes was forced to return to the pits after lap seven, while Laverty crossed the finish line in 15th place. For the second race in the afternoon, Laverty started in tenth and Sykes in eleventh. On the first lap, Sykes moved up into ninth place and then into eighth place shortly after that, where he stayed until halfway through the race. In the second half of the race, with a drying track, Sykes was in ninth place, before he crossed the finish line in tenth place after 21 laps. Laverty initially dropped down the field, but regained positions as the race went on to finish in the points as well in 14th place. The WorldSBK 2020 season finale will be held at Estoril, Portugal in two weeks . Quotes after race two at Magny-Cours. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “After we started the weekend strongly, unfortunately the yield was low. The crash in the first race put a spoke in our wheel for Sunday as well. The mechanics did a fantastic job and worked late into the night to pretty much build two new bikes. It was a close call for the warm-up, but we were able to compete. In terms of performance, however, we were clearly lacking the race data from Saturday. The Superpole race was a far cry from where we wanted to be for both riders, who were visibly battered after yesterday. We discovered that both bikes were extremely sensitive in the areas of tyre pressure and temperature, which put us at a distinct disadvantage in the Superpole race. We made changes to the chassis geometry of both bikes for race two to counteract the problems. The changes had a positive effect for Tom, but tenth place after our results on Friday and Saturday was disappointing. Eugene battled, but could only do enough to finish in 14th. This was another weekend to forget. The positives to take from the weekend are what we have learned, and the first qualifying 1-2 for BMW Motorrad in the WorldSBK.” Tom Sykes: “We came into the weekend well and honestly, the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team have been working very well. When we started in the first wet sessions, I was really comfortable with how the bike was working and the chassis of the BMW S 1000 RR. From there we just kept making steps forward, feeling really comfortable. We got ourselves a nice qualifying position for the race and then one thing led to another. After Saturday’s main race, the guys did an incredible job, I think they finished around 2:00 o’clock in the morning on both sides of the garage to prepare the bikes. So hats off to those boys. It was just unfortunate with that lack of information that would have certainly made today a lot easier for the big race. But we’ve learned a lot in the second main race. And like I said, with yesterday’s information we would have certainly done something different today. It has just been one thing after the other which is a shame because after Friday we were very confident for a strong result. But we will just stay positive.” Eugene Laverty: “After such a good feeling with the bike all weekend, on Friday and Saturday, in the wet conditions, today was a major let-down. The bike never felt the same. Right from the first lap of the morning’s warm-up, I’ve been having issues, particularly on corner entry and mainly in the right corners so we have to investigate, check that there isn’t something out of line after the huge crash yesterday. So let’s investigate, make sure that the bike’s correct for Estoril and try to finish the season on a high.” \n"}

The two BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team riders were initially in the midfield, before really cutting loose towards the end of qualification. Team celebrations were big when Laverty secured his first pole position on the BMW S 1000 RR and his team-mate Sykes rounded off the success by claiming second place. The team was correspondingly optimistic ahead of the first race in the afternoon. It had started to rain around an hour before the start, but the RR had proved to be extremely competitive with the wet-weather setup. However, hopes of claiming top results were soon dashed as Laverty and Sykes fell victim to an unfortunate sequence of events in turn one. There was contact between Garrett Gerloff (USA) and Sykes, who then began to slide and clipped Laverty’s rear wheel. Both BMW riders crashed and the race was over for Sykes and Laverty. Thankfully, neither rider was injured. Quotes after race one at Magny-Cours. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “What a day. It showed just how close together the ups and downs are in motorsport. Both Tom and Eugene had given great performances in the changeable, but consistently wet conditions since the first practice session. Everything was going perfectly. Tom had coped well with his fall in yesterday’s practice and the team had done a good job to prepare the motorbike perfectly for today. The Superpole session was a thriller but we knew that we could finish really high up. To finish with P1 and P2, the first qualifying 1-2 for BMW Motorrad in WorldSBK, is just fantastic! But the race was just as disappointing as the 1-2 was wonderful. The race finished for both of them in turn one. Gerloff had come from a long way back and went into T1 too hot. He then had to correct and hit Tom on his elbow, which made him fall. Unfortunately, Tom’s bike then clipped the rear wheel of Eugene’s bike, which then saw him come off with a highsider. We find it a bit difficult to understand that Gerloff got away without an official warning or a penalty, but the decision made by the race direction is fixed and we have to accept it. Both of our riders took a bit of a battering, but they are OK. Both of the bikes are badly damaged. We now have a long day ahead of us to put both motorbikes back together. We are looking ahead to tomorrow and we will be ready to go when the riders and bikes are both OK.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Qualifying was fantastic for the team to get a 1-2 in wet conditions. Both Tom and Eugene stayed out as long as possible to build their confidence up and they got what they deserved by starting P1 and P2 for race one. I must thank the whole team for their hard work, especially after the recent disappointments. Going into the race it was just cruel luck. Both riders got off the line comfortably with Jonathan Rea taking the lead. Garrett Gerloff came tight up the inside of Tom, however Tom already had the racing line, which meant he collided with him. That caused Tom to crash and ultimately take out his teammate Eugene at T1. As a team we are very disappointed in the race direction’s decision not to penalise Garrett for causing the crash. We feel he should have been penalised for his unsafe and out of control actions that led to this big consequence for our team. This does not help our cause moving forward, but we will fix our bikes tonight and come out fighting again tomorrow.” Eugene Laverty: “After the fantastic qualifying we had pole position and I was feeling optimistic ahead of race one. My aim was to bide my time and see where we ended up. Our bike has been working fantastic in these wet conditions, so I knew we had a good chance today. Our aim after the great qualifying session was to get that podium, so starting from P1 gave us the perfect chance to do that. Unfortunately, that was not the case after getting taken out in a crash caused by Garrett Gerloff. I am really angry about this crash because in a wet race like this to go in at the angle he did at T1 is not really the smart thing to do. It’s lucky that nobody got seriously hurt. However, tomorrow is another day, we will get another chance to showcase our potential, I will push hard from the off and get stuck in.” Tom Sykes: “It was definitely a good showing from the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team today. The BMW S 1000 RR has been working well all weekend and I had a great feeling on the bike from FP1. We have just been making small changes on the bike throughout the weekend getting used to the conditions. For the team to get a 1-2 in qualifying was great. I think the pace we had for the race was looking very strong but unfortunately that was not meant to be. It is a shame that both the BMWs got taken out in the way they did, only a couple of hundred yards from the start line. It was a thoughtless and reckless move from Garret, and it has left our boys a lot of work to do on both sides of the garage overnight. Unfortunately, we have had our fair share of bad luck this year and today is one of those days. Tomorrow we will come back stronger and get the results that the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team deserve.” \n"}

For the fourth consecutive year BMW and Frieze continue their long-term partnership with the major art initiative BMW Open Work by Frieze. Drawing inspiration from BMW engineering this commission brings together art, technology and design in a pioneering multi-platform format. The artist selected by the curator Attilia Fattori Franchini to create the fourth edition of BMW Open Work by Frieze is the New York-based Madeline Hollander, who will present the commission in two phases, as an interactive digital platform and livery intervention during Frieze Week in London 2020, and as a live, site-specific installation at Frieze Los Angeles in 2021. This year Frieze London and Frieze Masters introduce a hybrid format of online and offline activity, with Frieze Viewing Room taking place alongside an expanded program of Frieze Week (October 5-11) activity across London. For this edition of BMW Open Work by Frieze the artist and experimental choreographer Madeline Hollander has been commissioned. Curated by Attilia Fattori Franchini, BMW Open Work gives artists a platform to push the boundaries of their artistic work, starting the project with a creative dialogue between arts, technology, engineering and design to pursue their practice in innovative new directions.Working with performance, film and installation, Hollander explores how the human body in motion negotiates its limits within everyday systems of technology and engineering, industrial apparatus, intellectual property and daily rituals. Her performances and installations present perpetually looping events that intervene within spatial, psychological and temporal landscapes, and engage with novel modes of viewership. In her artistic practice, the artist positions numerous systems and devices of industrial modernity alongside sequences of human motion and behaviour in order to visualize the ways in which society and its urban environment have informed one another over time. Hollander presents her new commission for BMW Open Work in two phases at Frieze Week London 2020 with an interactive digital platform and livery intervention on BMW i3 electric vehicles, and as a live, site-specific installation at Frieze Los Angeles 2021.Madeline Hollander said of her commission: “‘Sunrise\/Sunset’ presents an immersive networked spectacle choreographed by sunsets and sunrises across the globe in real time. The piece, composed of hundreds of recycled BMW headlights, transforms an automatic adaptive system already embedded within vehicles, where headlights turn on\/off and adjust accordingly in response to light sensors, into a live twinkling global map.” Attilia Fattori Franchini added: “Now in its fourth year, BMW Open Work has established itself as a unique moment of exchange between industrial knowledge, technology and artistic talent. Working with a thrilling artist such as Madeline Hollander, pushing the possibilities of movement to depict invisible systems or processes, brings the program into a new and exciting direction. I can’t wait for ‘Sunrise\/Sunset’ to unfold across different platforms revealing Hollander’s investigation into perpetual loops, energy cycles and renewable power.”Titled “Sunrise\/Sunset” her project continues the artist's recent research into traffic patterns and working without human actors to depict unseen systems or processes. Emerging from an intense dialogue with BMW sustainability department and investigation into the automatic adaptive system of BMW headlights, Hollander creates for Frieze Los Angeles 2021 a site-specific, and self-sufficient, live installation composed of hundreds of recycled BMW LED headlights from the BMW Group Recycling and Dismantling Centre. Thus, the artist developed an energetic loop, a networked map choreographed by the sunsets and sunrises across the globe. Fascinated by the responsive nature of headlights technology which reacts to a number of factors such as movement, light and weather conditions, the artist syncs each headlight to different time zones thus creating a live ceaseless clock. As headlights are automatically switching to a “bright” setting at sunset in California, headlights are switching to fog settings as the sun rises in London.With her site-specific installation for BMW Open Work during Frieze Los Angeles 2021, Madeline Hollander invites the viewer to observe the ready-made choreographies that define our surroundings, invisible and ubiquitous factors such as geographical location, light levels or time of the day and their strong influence on our perceptions and behaviours. In Hollander’s work our apparently erratic individual actions and everyday technologies synchronically align becoming a collective, and in this case cascading-dance.The web-platform www.sunrise-sunset.com will be launched on October 7 during Frieze Week London 2020 and functions as preview and compendium to the site-specific installation, deepening and hyper-connecting part of the project research. Viewers will be invited to zoom in and out of a global map composed of headlights, each also observable in its microparts, sections and connections, lightening and darkening in response to their locations’ different times of the day. When exploring major cities on the map, users will also be peering into live-traffic cams streaming images from intersections from Berlin, New York, Rome, Los Angeles, a third eye on to the world mirroring the street traffic in a nonstop, 24\/7 cycle.Accompanying guests during Frieze Week in London, a fleet of unique BMW i3 electric vehicles will present the looping text “TOMORROW WILL BE NOTHING LIKE TODAY WILL BE NOTHING LIKE TOMORROW” a poetic advice conceived by the artist in conjunction with the project. The phrase, returning across different works by Hollander, crystallizes several conceptual and formal aspects of the artist's practice. Visible only on BMW i3 electric vehicles travelling across London, the intervention employs urban mobility to reiterate “Sunrise\/Sunset”’s investigation of perpetual loops, energy cycles and renewable power. BMW Open Work by FriezeBMW Open Work by Frieze is a major artistic initiative bringing together art, design and technology in pioneering multi-platform formats. For its premier in 2017, artist Olivia Erlanger integrated a motion-sensitive sculpture, audio and immersive fog in her work “Body Electric”; in 2018, Sam Lewitt engaged with BMW intellectual property and engine production to conceptually and physically explore the production cycle of a BMW engine in “CORE (the ‘Work’)”; in 2019, Camille Blatrix collaborated with BMW Individual to explore the primal and emotional relationships to labor and materiality, raising questions about functionality and desire in the installation “Sirens”.Frieze MusicFollowing four successful collaborations, BMW has partnered with Frieze Music once again to present Lianne La Havas for Frieze London and Frieze Masters 2020.

When Nick Catsburg (NED) crossed the finish line in the #99 BMW M6 GT3 shortly after 15:30 on Sunday afternoon, the celebrations knew no bounds. Together with ROWE Racing and his team-mates Alexander Sims and Nick Yelloly (both GBR), Catsburg had just won another thrilling Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER) on the Nordschleife. This was the first victory for ROWE Racing at the 24-hour race. And it was also a very special success for record winner BMW: the manufacturer’s 20th overall victory came on the 50th anniversary of the endurance classic. That was all a few days ago now, but the emotions are still just as strong. 1970 – 2010 – 2020: BMW was the overall winner of the inaugural 24-hour race in 1970. The 19th and most recent overall victory came courtesy of BMW Team Schnitzer in 2010. Since then, BMW had endured a long wait for its 20th overall win, although BMW teams had finished the race second on the podium on four occasions in recent years. It was almost as though the racing gods had come up with a special plan: overall victory number 20 was to come in 2020, at the 50th anniversary of the 24-hour race, 50 years after the first win and ten years after the latest success. “The moment the car crossed the finish line is one we will remember for a very long time,” says BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “We have waited ten years for this victory, although the BMW teams have missed out by incredibly small margins in recent years, and have finished runner-up on four occasions. The fact that we made it onto the top step of the podium on the 50th anniversary makes the win even more special. ROWE Racing took full advantage of the potential of the BMW M6 GT3 in extremely difficult conditions, with a flawless race and the right strategic decisions at the right time. It was an outstanding performance and team effort, which was rewarded with that long-awaited victory.” This success is also of particular importance to ROWE Racing team principal, Hans-Peter Naundorf. In 2017, the team missed out on overall victory by just 29.418 seconds after a dramatic climax. The 2018 and 2019 races did not go to plan, but the team’s fortunes changed this year. “With all the factors that made this race so special, the history of BMW, the yearning desire of all of us to finally win this race, and all the joint efforts, this success is something very, very special,” says Naundorf. “Throughout all the years, we have always invested the most energy and placed our biggest hopes in this race, and we have experienced some bitter disappointments with early exits, particularly in the last two years. It is very satisfying to have achieved this success – particularly as this year’s was the toughest 24-hour race in recent history. In the end, we were simply tougher than the rest.” It was the ROWE Racing team that claimed the very first 24-hour victory for the BMW M6 GT3 at Spa-Francorchamps in 2016. However, Naundorf believes there is no comparison between the two successes: “Our success in Spa in 2016 surprised everyone. At the Nürburgring, we had been one of the favourites for years, and we knew that we could do it. As such, after all the preparations and intensive years, this is a far bigger breakthrough. In Spa, we claimed an unexpected victory with a totally new car. Now, after five years, the BMW M6 GT3 is a stalwart and everything is sorted. In this situation, every little screw has to fit perfectly into place, you have to have the right drivers in the car, and then the weather gods have to give you these conditions, in which only the very best can come through without making any mistakes. Conquering the Nordschleife is the toughest thing I have done in my 25 years in motor racing.” Naundorf believes that the BMW M6 GT3 has benefitted from its maturity and the many kilometres it has completed on the Nordschleife: “The car is incredibly stable when you know how to use it properly. There are no longer any areas in need of improvement, all BMW cars ran like clockwork.” The strength of the BMW M6 GT3 on the Nordschleife this year is underlined, not only by the fact that it not only took overall victory, but also that four of the five BMW M6 GT3 finished the race without any incidents – including three cars in the top four. The third spot on the podium went to BMW Team Schnitzer, with the #98 ROWE Racing car in fourth place. \n"}

With the BMW G 310 GS, BMW Motorrad is creating a new experience in the displacement segment below 500 ccm since 2016. Extremely compact, robust and highly versatile in design, it immediately established itself as a genuine BMW GS - especially for newcomers. Four years after its début, BMW Motorrad now presents the new BMW G 310 GS. Versatile, safer and more dynamic – whether in everyday traffic, during pleasure rides on country roads or off-road in easy terrain.Single-cylinder engine according to EU-5 homologation with automatic idle boost and electromotive throttle controller.The heart of the new BMW G 310 GS is still the reliable 313 ccm liquid-cooled single-cylinder engine with four valves, two overhead camshafts and electronic fuel injection. The cylinder inclination to the rear and the cylinder head rotated by 180 degrees with intake at the front and exhaust at the rear remain the design characteristics. This arrangement follows the logic of optimal combustion air ducting and results in a particularly compact vehicle architecture. With an output of 25 kW and now offers an even more sensitive throttle response. Automatic idle speed increase when starting also prevents a possible sudden stalling of the engine. The self-boosting anti-hopping clutch is also new. It reduces engine drag torque and provides a significant increase in driving safety - particularly during braking manoeuvres involving simultaneous downshifting. It also offers significantly reduced operating forces at the clutch lever.New LED headlight and LED flashing turn indicators – seeing and being seen optimally.Whereas the BMW G 310 GS was already equipped with brake lights in LED technology, the new BMW G 310 GS now has a full-LED headlight for even better visibility at night and LED flashing turn indicators for increased visibility in traffic. The new LED headlight not only ensures particularly bright and homogeneous illumination of the road. Due to the modified connection, distracting vibrations of the light cone are a thing of the past. The three light functions high beam, low beam and, depending on the country, daytime driving light can be conveniently operated using the left handlebar controls.Hand lever adjustable in four stages for brake and clutch.Both, the clutch lever and the handbrake lever are now adjustable in four stages. It thus now provides ergonomic benefits – particularly for people with small hands. Stage 3 of the brake lever adjustment corresponds to the grip width until now. In the 1st position the brake lever is 6 mm closer to the handlebar.Gently revised design with an attractive basic colour and two exclusive style variants.GS is a promise at BMW Motorrad. It stands for absolute functionality, reliability and robustness. Accordingly, the new BMW G 310 GS can be recognised at first glance as a genuine BMW GS. With its characteristic windscreen, high front fender, striking flyline and short, high rear end, it has the main elements of the large BMW R 1250 GS models – and has an even more aggressive and dynamic appearance from the front thanks to the new LED headlight.Its colour concept also reflects that it is part of the BMW GS family. What all three colour variants of the BMW G 310 GS have in common are the engine housing covers for the alternator, clutch and water pump, now painted in metallic titanium grey.In addition to the typical GS colours in white with the basic colour plain polar white and tank side panels in grey, the new BMW G 310 GS has a very sporty appearance in Rallye style. The frame painted red and Kyanit blue metallic for the tank centre cover and front emphasise the off-road talents and give the motorcycle an extremely dynamic appearance. As the \"40 Years GS\" edition, however, the BMW G 310 GS is based on a famous historical model from the BMW GS history - the R 100 GS. Accordingly, it is in black and yellow - with the basic colour cosmic black and yellow graphics on the tank side panels. Just in time for the anniversary, BMW Motorrad is also presenting a new rider equipment collection.All new features of the BMW G 310 GS at a glance:• Single-cylinder engine according to EU-5 homologation with electromotive throttle controller and automatic idle speed increase.• Self-boosting anti-hopping clutch.• New LED headlight and LED flashing turn indicators.• Hand lever adjustable in four stages for brake and clutch.• Engine housing covers of alternator, clutch and water pump painted titanium grey metallic.• Gently revised design with an attractive basic colour and two exclusive style variants. Technical data are available in the PDF file. Press material on the BMW motorcycles and BMW Motorrad rider's equipment is available in the BMW Group PressClub at www.press.bmwgroup.com.\n"}

Learn, keep driving, don’t make any mistakes were the objectives of the BMW Junior Team as they made their debut in the 24 Hours Nürburgring (GER) last weekend. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) not only ended up meeting these objectives, they also brought home a class win in an impressive manner and, finishing 19th in the overall rankings, were the best non-GT3 team in the whole field. Thus, the BMW Junior Team mastered the highlight of their first year of training with flying colours. When the BMW Junior Team moved into their shared house within easy reach of the Nürburgring in June 2020, the mission was clear. Prepare as well as possible in terms of driving, physically and mentally to survive the 24 Hours Nürburgring, possibly the most difficult circuit race there is. Countless hours later in the simulator, in the gym and above all in different BMW racing cars, one thing is clear, Dan Harper, Max Hesse and Neil Verhagen lived up to everything that those responsible for reviving the legendary BMW Junior Team of 1977 promised they would. Jochen Neerpasch, who founded the first BMW Junior Team in 1977, especially is on hand to assist and advise the new generation as a mentor. It goes without saying that he was at the track this past weekend – and was visibly impressed by the performances of his protégés: “The BMW Junior Team really did experience the most difficult conditions you could imagine on their debut at the 24 Hours Nürburgring. But they mastered this extreme challenge with flying colours. That was their masterpiece of the first year of their training together.” And the young drivers were happy themselves at the end of the turbulent race, which had to be interrupted Saturday night due to heavy rain and posed a challenge for all drivers – even the most experienced in the field – with the constantly changing track and weather conditions. “That was an awesome race. Many thanks to the team, to Dan and Neil,” said Hesse. “We had very challenging conditions for our first-ever 24-hour race. So, to finish a race like that with a class win and a top-20 finish in the overall rankings is incredible.” Harper said: “It feels fantastic to have finished the first 24-hour race as class winner and best non-GT3. Many thanks to the Walkenhorst Motorsport team and to BMW Motorsport for giving us the opportunity to contest this race. And huge thanks to my team-mates and to Jochen Neerpasch, who together with BMW Motorsport selected us to be the BMW Junior Team.” Verhagen was the closing driver for the BMW Junior Team and brought the Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M4 GT4 safely across the finish line, despite a moment of horror after a spin. After 78 race laps, Verhagen had a lead of almost nine minutes over the second-placed car in the SP8T class and finished 19th overall. Only cars in the top classes of SP9 and SP-X finished ahead of him. “Being allowed to be the one to cross the finish line at the end was a very special moment,” said Verhagen. “I can’t thank BMW Motorsport and the Walkenhorst team enough, both for the fantastic car that we were allowed to driver here in the 24-hour race, and for the opportunity to even be part of this BMW Junior Team.” The 24 Hours Nürburgring 2020 was the highlight of the BMW Junior Team’s first year of training. They completed their first races at the Nordschleife in the BMW M240i Racing, to get their permit for the racetrack. In this entry-level car, Harper and Verhagen took a class win in the third race of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) season. Then, in the fourth NLS race, they upgraded to the BMW M4 GT4, with which the team will contest the rest of the Nordschleife season after the 24-hour race. In their second year of training in 2021, they will then switch to the GT3 car. “I’m already really excited to see how they will do next time in the GT3 car,” said Neerpasch. “That is when the goal will be to be involved in the battle for the top spots.”\n"}

Nick Catsburg (NED), Alexander Sims (GBR) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) won the 24 Hours Nürburgring (GER) in the ROWE Racing #99 BMW M6 GT3 last weekend, securing their places in the annals of BMW Motorsport. There were two milestones to celebrate: 50 years after the first BMW overall win at the first ever edition of the 24-hour race, a BMW team topped the podium again, and it was also the brand’s 20th victory at the ‘Green Hell’. In an interview, the trio talk about the turbulent race, an emotional roller coaster ride and the importance of the win in their careers. First question for you: How long did the party go on? Nick Catsburg: “It wasn’t all that spectacular. I was back in my room shortly after 2 a.m.” Alexander Sims: “It wasn’t a wild party. It was just nice to sit at the bar and have a few drinks with the team and enjoy the success.” Nick Yelloly: “At least we were well enough the next morning to have breakfast together.” Sims: “Really? I can’t remember that…” (laughs) Hopefully you can remember the race! How important is the win at the 24h Nürburgring in your careers? Catsburg: “Extremely important. It is my favourite event and my favourite track. I’d rank the win at the same level as my win at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps in 2015.” Sims: “Along with my Spa win in 2016, this is definitely the biggest win of my career.” Yelloly: “It was my first big win as a BMW works driver – and the first time that I crossed the finish line at the 24 Hours Nürburgring. To then get to celebrate the huge victory at the same time is right at the top of my list of triumphs.” Were you aware of the historic aspect of the win for BMW – 50 years after the first win, 20th overall win and ten years since the last win? Yelloly (laughs): “Absolutely. After all, we saw in the reporting often enough that this win would be very significant for BMW which makes the honour of having brought home this important win for BMW all the greater. I think that we will all only be aware of the full implications in the coming days.” Alexander, Nicky, both of you were very close to winning with ROWE Racing in 2017, and ended up finishing second. Was that on your mind? Catsburg: “I have actually finished second twice and said to the lads: ‘I definitely don’t want to finish in second again.’ And to be honest, when I kept hearing how quickly our opponents were catching up from behind on the radio in the closing stage, I thought: ‘Darn, please don’t let it happen again!’ Fortunately things went differently this time around.” Alexander, how nervous were you having to sit back and watch Nicky in the extremely tense closing stage? Sims (laughs): “As Nicky was in the car I was extremely nervous! Seriously though, it is a strange feeling when you are on the outside and don’t have any control over what’s happening. I had full confidence in Nicky’s capabilities, but we saw during the race that the BMW M6 GT3 worked well to varying degrees in different conditions. You can’t really do a lot as a driver in that situation.” Nicky, we have to talk about the braking mistake in turn 1, when you passed the Audi that was in the pit… Catsburg (laughs): “I was just so happy that I was at the front! The truth is that the track conditions changed rapidly on these final laps. I simply overestimated the grip slightly at that moment and made a minor braking mistake. Fortunately it isn’t a huge problem there.” Honestly, how much pressure were you under having to bring home the win as the closing driver? Catsburg: “There is pressure in every racing situation. The driver is also under great pressure in the top qualifying or at the start. But I was a little bit nervous all the same, I have to admit. Obviously, the stress increases when you keep being told over the radio that your rivals are catching up so you need to push. You’re already at the limit and constantly have to weigh up how much to risk. On the other hand, it goes without saying that it is cool to be the one to cross the finish line at the end. I had goose bumps throughout the final lap. It was funny, because I had to keep telling myself that I just had to finish that lap.” In which conditions did the car perform best? Yelloly: “I think that our rivals had a clear advantage when it was really wet, but when it dried up, we were able to turn the balance of power in our favour, particularly with the ‘drying wet’ tyres. On a drying track we were clearly faster than our opponents. Fortunately, the conditions at the end suited us. I even had a full stint on slicks. They also felt really good.” Did you feel honoured to be given the drive in top qualifying and at the start? Yelloly: “It was definitely an honour. I knew fairly early on that I would be allowed to drive in qualifying. We only decided the starting driver shortly before the race. It’s great to have had that trust placed in me alongside drivers like Alexander and Nicky, who have both already enjoyed great successes for BMW.” Alexander, you were in the car when the race was abandoned on Saturday evening. Was the red flag the right decision? Sims: “It was the only decision to make. I was relatively fast compared to our rivals at that point, but it was honestly only a matter of time before there was a serious accident. There were sections of the track, Pflanzgarten, for example, where you could only guess where you were driving. You couldn’t see a thing. Race control did a really good job at that stage, because it was really dangerous out there.” How was the restart for you on Saturday morning? Sims: “It was an emotional roller coaster. My first stint in the wet was really difficult. I had the feeling that I was throwing away our chance of winning because I was so slow. I felt really helpless at that point. We simply didn’t have the pace and kept dropping down the field. Then, in the second stint it was the complete reverse. The track dried off, the tyres worked and suddenly we were the fastest in the field. I overtook one car after another and had a good feeling again. But I didn’t know if we would really be driving for the win again yet at that point.” Nick, when did you first think: ‘Okay, this is for the win?’ Yelloly: “After Alexander started moving up the field and handed the car over to me, I knew that we were in a good position. Then, about halfway through my double stint I had the leader in sight and knew that if I could keep up with it, we would have a chance.” How much help with the win was it that the BMW M6 GT3 has already done so many race kilometres on the Nordschleife and that you are already very familiar with it? Catsburg: “That really helped not only us as drivers, but also the team. The car had no issues and we as a team didn’t make a single mistake either.” Sims: “I think knowing the car so well helped us particularly in the changing conditions. In situations like that, as a driver you don’t want to be sitting in a car where you don’t quite know how it will react. We all have so much experience in the BMW M6 GT3 that we always knew how close to the limit we could push it.” Nicky and Nick, you’re both in action again this weekend, aren’t you? Catsburg: “That’s right. I’m at the airport again already because I’m contesting the 8 Hours of Indianapolis for Walkenhorst Motorsport in the BMW M6 GT3 at the weekend, as part of the Intercontinental GT Challenge. So, I’m hoping for the next win – but only for me, not for Nick!” (laughs) Yelloly (laughs): “Obviously, because I will be in the sister car we’ll be rivals this time, so it goes without saying that I can’t stand Nicky one bit this coming weekend. In all seriousness: I’m flying this afternoon and am really looking forward to racing at Indianapolis for the first time in my life.” Sims: “Okay. While you’ll be racing again already, I’ll be relaxing at home and enjoying my victory at the Nürburgring.” (laughs)\n"}

The season ends in the FIM Superbike World Championship 2020 this weekend . The 4.411-kilometre track is a technical challenge with various narrow turns, three slow hairpin bends and a long straight.

Magny-Cours proved to be a good circuit for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team last year when Sykes finished on the podium in third with his RR in the race Saturday. Quotes ahead of the race weekend at Magny-Cours. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We’re looking forward to, according to the currently forecast, a typical Magny-Cours – with cold and wet weather. We’re already at the penultimate race weekend of this unusual season. For the first time, a limited number of fans will be allowed in, and I am confident that the conditions won’t deter the French fans – we look forward to their passion. In terms of our performance, we will try to keep in the same direction for Magny-Cours after the upward trend in Barcelona. Even though the track and conditions are totally different to those from two weeks ago, we are confident that we will be able to do well here. Even if it does nothing but rain, we are still well-positioned with the BMW S 1000 RR and our two riders. Magny-Cours gave us our final podium of the season last year; our goal is to head in this direction again.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The team is really looking forward to Magny-Cours. Last season, we were very competitive there on the first year for the BMW S 1000 RR. Now we are coming from the last race at Barcelona where we were very happy with the performance of Tom and Eugene and the team. To finish the second race in fifth and seventh really shows what our expectations are so we would like to continue that progress into Magny-Cours this weekend. We are confident that we can achieve similar positive results. The expectations could be affected by the weather; it does not look like the weather will be very kind with rain on most days. The temperatures will also be quite low and we will see how we can adapt the BMW S 1000 RR to these conditions but nevertheless, we go as a team with a lot of optimism and we aim to continue the good form from Barcelona.” Tom Sykes: “I am very much looking forward to the French round of the Superbike World Championship. I like Magny-Cours; I enjoy the layout of the track to be honest. Last year, we had a podium there with the BMW S 1000 RR so we are certainly hoping to pick up on the results that we had there last year. This weekend certainly looks interesting in terms of the weather forecast. The target will be to try and capitalise on the handling of the bike in these tricky conditions and hopefully we can aim to get some podium finishes before the end of the season. Apart from that all ready, prepared and looking forward to start the race weekend. I’m also looking forward to having fans in the grandstands again. We’ve missed them and it’s great that they can be back.” Eugene Laverty: “It’ll be great to have the fans back at Magny-Cours. Phillip Island was a long time ago when we last had fans trackside and since then we’ve only had tumbleweeds in the grandstands! It’s still a little too early to look at the detailed weather forecast for the weekend but we are expecting some wet weather in any case. I had the opportunity to try the BMW S 1000 RR in wet conditions during practice at Catalunya and my impressions were good. Rain or shine – my aim is to continue our forward progress of recent rounds towards that top five.” \n"}

{"prompt":"At the end of September 2000, the modern MINI enjoyed its world premiere at the Paris Motor Show. The successful relaunch of the traditional British heritage brand introduced a completely new category of vehicle and laid the foundation stone for continuous development and diversity in the model range. A tour in an early MINI Cooper recalls memories of two decades packed with driving fun.   ->","completion":" Munich. An original celebrates a landmark anniversary. 20 years ago, the MINI was presented for the first time ever in a public arena at the Mondial de l’Automobile in Paris. A unique success story in the automobile sector commenced with the relaunch of the traditional British heritage brand under the umbrella of the BMW Group and the presentation of the models MINI One and MINI Cooper. As the successor to the classic Mini, which ceased to be produced just a few days later after 41 years, the second generation provided all the enablers for another revolution in the small car segment. The MINI was the first premium vehicle in this class. Its modern concept has promoted continuous advanced development to the present day, encompassing driving fun, efficiency, comfort, safety, connectivity and not least model diversity.A journey through time with an early example of the MINI Cooper provides an ideal opportunity to get on the track of the pioneering character exhibited by the second generation. The ambassador from the initial phase of the British original for the 21st century rolled off the assembly line in October 2001, six months after production had been launched at the MINI plant in Oxford. Three previous owners already experienced loads of driving fun as they powered along some 175,000 kilometres. And like every MINI, it was given a name. This model was dubbed “Sunny”, inspired by the paint finish for the body in Liquid Yellow, which transformed it into a rarity. In the first year of sales for the modern MINI in Germany, only one in every fifteen vehicles was supplied in this colour. The combination with a roof and door mirror caps in Black was even rarer.The starting signal for the development of the second generation of the MINI was already given in July 1994. Alongside styling details like the short overhangs, round headlamps and hexagonal radiator grille, a top priority for the designers was to transfer the fundamental idea from the initial years of the classic Mini to the modern era of the automobile. The modern MINI similarly needed to be unique, offer space for four people and their luggage, provide an efficient travelling experience and generate enthusiasm with driving characteristics not achieved by any other model in its class. Contemporary aspirations for comfort and maximum safety standards were also taken into account. Once again, a revolutionary new small car was created – geared to the requirements of its era in all criteria, and this time developed and manufactured to comply with all the quality benchmarks of a premium brand into the bargain.In autumn of 1997, selected journalists were permitted to take their first look at the MINI 2000 study. This generated the MINI fever. The relaunch of the brand and the imminent presentation of the series vehicle were the subjects of intense debate particularly online. In parallel to the world premiere in Paris, national and international MINI websites were launched and more than 100,000 prospective customers interested in the MINI had soon already registered.The sale of the MINI in the United Kingdom started on 7 July 2001 and the market launch in Germany was celebrated two months later. Already at this point, a weekend shift was introduced at the MINI plant in Oxford for the first time, so as to be in a position to meet the massive demand. And yet the global triumph had only just begun. In Japan – where the classic Mini had a huge fan community – the second generation also encountered enormous interest. The sales launch there was scheduled for 2 March 2002 because this date is pronounced “MI-NI” in Japanese. At last, the turn of US fans finally came on 22 March 2002. The dealers there had already booked orders for 20,000 cars.The MINI of the second generation enthralled drivers around the world with its agile handling. Right up to the present day, “Sunny” leaves absolutely no doubt that the MINI has been designed for athletic driving and extreme cornering. The 85 kW\/115 hp engine powering the MINI Cooper also provides impressive acceleration capacity. Some 20 years ago, this also impressed John Cooper – the ingenious sports-car designer who had previously paved the way for the classic Mini to take race tracks by storm. “The MINI Cooper puts a smile on your face,” he commented after his first test drive in the eponymous model once more named after him. The elementary design principles from the first generation had been taken over in the new edition with front-wheel drive and the transversely mounted four-cylinder engine at the front. However, the contemporary driving fun unrivalled in the competitive environment was now delivered by a MacPherson front axle with axle shafts of the same length, the multi-link rear axle that is unique in this segment, disk brakes on all four wheels and the series antilock braking system including cornering brake control and electronic brake force distribution.Right from the start, wide-ranging options were provided for individualising a key component of the typical MINI style. Diversity and premium look within the interior were created by a wide range of features including seats and upholstery, interior trims and steering wheels in many versions, alongside modern equipment options such as automatic climate control, heated seats, panorama sunroof and navigation. The original MINI accessories programme included auxiliary headlamps, white taillights, an aerodynamic package, a range of roof trims as well as additional instruments and even a car phone.As early as 2003, a diesel engine was rolled out in the second generation of the MINI, and the convertible MINI Cabrio followed in the next year. The model diversity was even greater for the third generation launched in 2006. MINI Clubman, MINI Coupé and MINI Roadster joined the range. Not long after this, the brand succeeded in breaking into the premium compact segment where today the MINI Countryman and the new MINI Clubman create that go-kart feeling in a further dimension. Additional target groups were conquered in what is now the fourth model generation of the small car with the MINI 5-Door.The interior also demonstrates that reinterpretation of design features in the second generation of the MINI already formed the platform for technological advance. Here “Sunny” expresses its individual style most notably with the large speedometer in the centre of the instrument panel. In the first-generation MINI, the centrally positioned instrument had been replaced by new displays behind the steering wheel when the type MK V Mini was introduced in 1985. And in the latest fourth-generation MINI, speed, engine speed and other driver-related information are shown in a modern instrument cluster on the steering column – also in digital display depending on the model. Nevertheless, the central instrument continues to be an important design and control element to this day. It serves as a control display for navigation, infotainment, telephone and vehicle functions.Over the period of 20 years, the MINI has become noticeably more mature but its character still remains inimitable. And the fresh colour shade that suits “Sunny” so perfectly is now acting as a very special beacon for the future. Yellow colour accents characterise the MINI Cooper SE , which marks the next evolutionary stage of the original as the first all-electric powered model of the brand. \n"}

One year ago, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team started its debut season in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) at the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet (FRA). This weekend, the team’s first season drew to a close with the ‘12 Hours of Estoril’ in Portugal. The #37 BMW S 1000 RR, with riders Markus Reiterberger (GER), Kenny Foray (FRA) and Peter Hickman (GBR) in the saddle, was once again one of the fastest bikes in the world championship at the fourth and final round of the season. However, luck was not on the team’s side in the race, and the #37 had to settle for seventh place after twelve hours of racing. The BMW S 1000 RR demonstrated its speed already in qualifying. Reiterberger set the fastest time across all the qualifying sessions with a new lap record. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team lined up in third place on the grid for the 12-hour race, with grid positions determined by the average time of each of the three riders’ fastest laps. The race started at 08:00 local time on Saturday morning. Sunny weather meant track conditions were dry and good. Start rider Reiterberger had climbed into second place soon, and it was not long before the #37 BMW S 1000 RR was leading the race. He then set about pulling clear of the chasing pack. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team spent over an hour at the head of the field, before things took a turn for the worse. Hickman skidded and crashed in a left-hander. He was able to continue, but the relatively minor crash caused such severe damage to the bike that it required a long stop for repairs. That saw the #37 bike drop back to 19th place, eight laps behind the leaders. As the race progressed, the trio of Reiterberger, Foray and Hickman set about gradually working their way back through the field. After 12 hours, the #37 crossed the finish line in seventh place. The second BMW S 1000 RR, Team LRP Poland’s #90 bike, finished ninth. The 2019\/20 season, which started one year ago at Le Castellet, was reduced to four races as a result of the coronavirus. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team claimed its first podium against the top-class world championship field with third place at the opening round. The next podium came in the second race in mid-December at Sepang (MAS), courtesy of another third place. After a break, the season resumed at Le Mans (FRA) at the end of August. Shortly before the finish, the team crashed out whilst running fifth. Seventh place at the finale in Estoril means the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team ends its debut season in sixth place overall. Quotes after the ‘12 Hours of Estoril’. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It is obviously disappointing at first, when you suffer such a set-back whilst leading the race. We had our sights set on a top finish and saw that we had the potential to achieve that. However, these things happen in racing. Neither the team nor the riders buried their heads in the sand after that incident. Instead, they battled and gave it their all right through to the finish. Although we did not get the result we were after at the finale, you have to look at the big picture. It was our first season in FIM EWC, with its very strong field, and we had little preparation time before our first outing at the Bol d’Or one year ago. We have twice finished on the podium in this season’s four races, and were extremely competitive at the other two events. In addition, we were able to prove the reliability of our RR at the Le Mans 24-hour race as well as at the 12-hour race at Estoril, even if we lost strong positions there due to riding mistakes. That is overall not a bad record for us as ‘rookies’. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team and the BMW S 1000 RR have established themselves among the best in the world at the first attempt. I would like to say a big thank you to Werner Daemen, Steven Casaer and the entire team for the hard and highly-professional work they have put in this season. We achieved a very high standard in our first year, which gives us an outstanding basis for our second season in FIM EWC. Congratulations to our tyre partner Dunlop who won the title with SERT. We will start a new attempt to fight for the title in the coming season.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “In the end it was seventh place and we are not really happy because I think that we could have won the race without the problems we had. ‘Hicky’s crash was of course a big problem and we lost many laps as we had to repair the bike including a change of the swing arm. When you see the gap we had at the chequered flag I think that the win would have been possible. Markus did a tremendous job, as did all riders and the entire team over the whole week. Only the crash was a pity. After Le Mans, it was the second time we lost many points due to a crash. But it was our first year in the FIM EWC and we have seen that without crashes we can fight for the world championship – this is really not bad for the first year. So overall I am a happy person but a little bit disappointed from the result today.” Markus Reiterberger: “I had the honour to do the start and it went very well – I was a fast runner and then I came off pretty fast. Other than the two guys in front of me, I had decent grip pretty early and I passed them. I then built a gap over my stint which was very good and important. ‘Hicky’ initially stepped up on this but then unfortunately crashed. I feel sorry for him as he just made a small riding mistake. It was a pity for the entire team but you can hardly reproach him for that. It was a normal racing crash that can happen to everyone. The team did a superb job and repaired the bike extremely quick. After that, we rode super stints, at top-three level, even though we still had the one or two issues related to the crash. We worked our way up to finish seventh. Of course we had hoped for a podium or the win and that definitely would have been possible. But this is Endurance. It was a great event on a fantastic track and I only can say ‘thank you’ to the team and to my team-mates. All gave their very best and the day will come for us to be rewarded again for our work.” Kenny Foray: “The race is over and the championship season is over and for sure it is not the result that we had expected. But this is racing and I think that we can learn a lot from the last two races. For me personally, the final race at Estoril was not easy because after the crash the bike was not easy to ride so we needed to adapt our riding style. But that is endurance; you need to be able to adapt to everything. And we were able to push and to work our way back to seventh place. This result is not so bad but I think that we were able to make a podium today. But it’s like it is. We learn and come back next season.” Peter Hickman: “I really want to say sorry to the team because we had the pace to actually win this race and my mistake was what caused all the problems which is a big shame. But it was good to show that we had the pace and the team worked really, really well in getting the bike back on track. I think that overall, we have shown the potential of the bike and the riders but it is just disappointing not to have won the race. Sorry again to the entire team.” \n"}

BMW teams secured promising starting positions with the BMW M6 GT3 in Friday’s Top Qualifying on the eve of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER). Nick Yelloly (GBR) and Augusto Farfus (BRA) qualified fifth and sixth for ROWE Racing and BMW Team Schnitzer, meaning they start the race from row three. With some stretches of the circuit wet and some dry, qualifying became something of a tyre lottery. Marco Wittmann (GER, ROWE Racing) and Christian Krognes (NOR, Walkenhorst Motorsport) finished eighth and ninth to claim their places in the top ten. Henry Walkenhorst (GER) was 16th in the AM car run by Walkenhorst Motorsport. Augusto Farfus (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer, 6th place): “I gambled on the cut slick tyre, which could have worked but did not unfortunately. I had to come into the pits and switch back to wets, so it was very difficult for me to pull a lap with only one shot while the track was improving. People were faster on their second lap. Overall it’s okay.” Marco Wittmann (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 8th place): “My two qualifying laps were really good when you consider how tough the conditions were. Up to that point, we had only had a few wet laps. It is obviously the same for everyone, but was definitely a small advantage for those who had already qualified in Top Qualifying 1. However, eighth place is a good starting position for the race. Our second car is in fifth place, so we are really happy.” Nick Yelloly (#99 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 5th place): “It was very tricky out there. I haven’t driven in those conditions very often. It was a really difficult lap in drying conditions on wets. Some parts of the track were really, really slippery and other parts were quite dry, so it was about judging it right. I had the out lap to have a look and sort of make sure that I get my reference a little bit. I had the feeling it would only be the first lap that would count as in the first qualifying session it was also only the first lap so I just went for it. I am pretty happy. It was actually my first shoot-out qualifying here, so I have relatively little experience. As such, I am satisfied with the result.” Henry Walkenhorst (#100 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, 16th place): “Qualifying was obviously a bit difficult. I went out on wet tyres – safety first – as I just wanted to enjoy this wonderful lap, even if there were unfortunately no fans. On the first lap, I had thought it was definitely not right for slicks or cut tyres however it was exactly the opposite on my second lap. It was all about the experience and, to a certain degree, that is what makes the ‘Green Hell’ so special. It is simply a dream to be out there by yourself on the most beautiful racetrack in the world.” Christian Krognes (#101 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, 9th place): “It was a big challenge. We knew that it would be very difficult with the weather. Some parts of the track were completely dry, but mostly it was actually very wet and I was a bit surprised to see how wet it was. We went on cut slicks and I honestly thought that it would be a bit dryer; that would definitely have played into our hands. I spent the out lap and the first lap just to find out where the dry lines were and from that point on I just tried to maximise it on the second lap. It wasn’t easy but it’s a lot of fun as well when you get through. The car is fine, all the BMWs are fine, so I am happy about that.”\n"}

Ahead of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER), two generations of the BMW Junior Team and their BMW race cars met in the Eifel Mountains.

Marc Surer (SUI), a member of the legendary BMW Junior Team from 1977, took his place at the wheel of the modern-day BMW M4 GT4. Jochen Neerpasch, founder of the first BMW Junior Team and mentor to the current crop of drivers, was also there to witness the car exchange in person. Video: Marc Surer and the BMW Junior Team test vintage and modern-day race cars: https:\/\/b.mw\/Born_to_Race. A handful of legendary cars awaited the drivers in the Nürburgring paddock. Hesse took the wheel of the BMW 320 Group 5, with which the 1977 BMW Junior Team – consisting of Surer, Eddie Cheever (USA) and Manfred Winkelhock (GER) – caused such a stir in the German Production Car Championship. Harper and Verhagen drove the BMW Formula 2 cars from 1978 and 1979, which Surer and Bruno Giacomelli (ITA) used to race. Surer, who had previously put all the historic cars through a performance test, took his place at the wheel of the modern BMW M4 GT4, with which the current BMW Junior Team will contest its first 24-hour race this weekend. “For me, it is always like déjà vu when I get back in the old cars,” said Surer. “It only takes a couple of laps before you feel as though you have never been away. You feel at home and everything comes automatically to you. It is all saved away on your hard drive.” For Harper, Hesse and Verhagen, the adjustment was somewhat larger. “At times, they had to operate the clutch, double clutch, and shift gear in a race car for the first time in their lives,” explained Surer. “For me, it was simpler with all the modern driver aids. The car was a pleasure to drive.” The current BMW Junior Team was impressed by their test drives in the vintage cars. “It was unbelievable. The sound alone stirs up emotions that you no longer experience very often in modern-day cars,” said Verhagen. “I’d like to say thank you very much to everyone who made this cool experience possible.” Harper said: “It was a great privilege to drive that car here at the Nürburgring. I found it astounding how much the technology has progressed between my 1978 car and Neil’s car from 1979.” Hesse also enjoyed his experience in the BMW 320 Group 5: “Awesome. The sound, the handling. You could feel straight away how light the car is. I only did a few flying laps, and take my hat off to the guys who used to go racing in these cars in the 1970s. At first it was a bit strange. You open the door and see a steering wheel without any buttons. There is just a switch to start the car – and then the gearstick for the manual transmission. It was incredibly enjoyable.” Surer not only enjoyed the driving, but also meeting his successors. “The new BMW Junior Team is a similar mix of personalities and nationalities as we had back then,” said Surer. “The concept was very familiar to me – to select drivers because they are good and have been successful in their classes, not because they have a lot of money. It is great to see that a system that launched my career and those of my colleagues back then is still in place today.” Back in the 1970s, Jochen Neerpasch was responsible for the concept of the BMW Junior Team. Nowadays, he still plays an important role in the training programme, as a mentor to Harper, Hesse and Verhagen. His summary of the meeting of the two generations: “It was wonderful to see these historic cars back in action. And being able to drive cars like those was like a second Christmas for our BMW Junior Team. Seeing Marc Surer together with the new generation of Juniors was also interesting. Our principle, that talented youngsters learn faster as a team, worked back then – and I am sure it will work this time too.”\n"}

He has spent almost his entire career driving BMWs on the Nordschleife. In 1996 and 1997, he won the 24-hour race in the legendary ‘Eifelblitz’ BMW M3. Scheid called time on his career before the start of the 2020 season. On the 50th anniversary of the 24-hour race and the first overall victory for BMW, Scheid looks back on his two triumphs and his experiences over the course of 50 years on the Nordschleife. Mr. Scheid, you have witnessed almost the entire history of the Nürburgring 24 Hours. What was the best time? Johannes Scheid: “It is always nicest when you win. As such, the 1990s, when I twice took overall victory, were obviously the best for me. However, the other times were also very nice. In total, I claimed about ten class victories in the 24-hour race. From a driver’s point of view, the best time was with the BMW M3 E30, when there was just two of us alternating at the wheel, as that meant you got to do a lot of driving. The time flew by. I didn’t sleep during that time anyway, as I also had to muck in as a mechanic if anything happened to the car. The most we used to get was a massage.” Did you always drive BMW cars? Scheid: “I started with a BMW 1800. From time to time I drove smaller cars, but since I started driving the BMW M3 E30, I always raced in a BMW and finished in the top five of the overall standings on several occasions.” Your glory days came in 1996 and 1997, with two overall victories. That was when the legend of the ‘Eifelblitz’ was born, wasn’t it? Scheid: “Correct. That was our first victory in 1996. Our BMW M3 E36 was mainly white and, in my opinion, looked pretty naked. Sabine Schmitz – still Sabine Reck at the time – was driving the car with us and was a talented artist. I said to her: ‘Come up with something.’ She painted the castle that overlooks the Nürburgring on the side, and the name ‘Eifelblitz’ was born.” Which of the two victories was the most special? Scheid: “Definitely the second one in 1977, because of the circumstances. We had almost completely written the car off after the first few practice laps. We brought the wreck back to our garage and completely dismantled everything except the engine. The garage resembled a battlefield. We then built it back together with new parts, but left off the whole of the front. It then went to a colleague on the straightening bench, where we completed the reassembly. By the second practice session, we were back out on the track. I drove a test lap and heard something rattling. It turned out that it was a part of the wishbone. Peter Zakowski was driving at the time and happened to have a turning shop, so we dragged one of his colleagues out of the disco that night, and got him to make a copy of the part. Unfortunately, we could not determine exactly what the material was, so we ended up just using the production part, which was made of rubber. That worked too. We were able to start the race, but the VWs were actually better than us – especially as our ABS also failed. However, we had the upper hand when it came to tyre selection in the rain, and had to make fewer pit stops. That is how we won.” You drove your last 24-hour race in 2009. However, you have remained a true great at the Nürburgring outside of the cockpit. Scheid: “As well as driving and my role as team principal, I was also involved in founding the endurance cup and pretty much introduced organised racing at the Nürburgring. We first met at my house for breakfast, then later again in Cologne, where we decided to form an endurance series. I am also still a member of the presidium at the Deutscher Sportfahrer Kreis DSK. We played an important role in allowing the Nürburgring Endurance Series to be the first series to stage races again after the first phase of the pandemic.” As team principal, you recently competed with the BMW M240i Racing. What do you like best, the old cars or the modern ones? Scheid: “The modern cars at the end were great. You obviously had far less work to do on them than in the cars that I built myself. Particularly ‘Dicke’, our BMW M3 GTS – actually a BMW M3 GTR, but I could not call it that because of the works car of the same name. That was a nice time too, but the modern BMW M240i Racing was always very reliable and we always had very nice battles in our Cup class.” Ahead of this season, you sold your BMW M240i Racing and brought an end to your career as team principal. Why was that? Scheid: “First and foremost it was simply becoming harder and harder to cover the costs as a small team with just one car. I would actually have liked to continue driving in the 2020 season, but then along came the pandemic and I said to myself: ‘It’s time to call it a day’.” How will you follow the 24-hour race this weekend? Scheid: “I think I will be there.

A human-robot performance”, developed by the team of the art and technology studio H3, debuted in the selection of Ars Electronica, the most important art and technology festival in the world. BMW 4 Series Coupé, one of the most sophisticated and emotionally charged models of the brand, made its presence felt in a special installation during the event, more than a month before the official debut on the market, on October 24.The debut of “Who Am I” was presented in the multidisciplinary project, H3 Garden simultaneously with the exhibition of interactive lighting installations and the series of live concerts Kaustik Nights. The event also marked or parted: the \"Silk Industry\" industrial space from the communist period, located in the heart of Bucharest and regained for cultural projects, is to be demolished to make way for new commercial and residential areas. Until now, Popa Nan 82 has been the space for the creation, production and presentation of art installations created by the H3 team. “Who Am I? A human-robot performance” is a unique show-installation that combines in contemporary, theater and lighting installations with a unique protagonist – Kuka – an industrial robot that weighs a ton and a half and was previously used in production process at the BMW plant in Regensburg (Germany). The project speaks through spectacular visual constructions about the connection between creator and creation, about the search for identity, about how objects can acquire identity and life. The myth of Pygamlion is one of the main points of inspiration. At the center is Kuka, in an incredible transformation of the industrial robot into an emotional performer with choreographer Andrea Gavriliu, offering a strong contrast between mechanical and organic. The 400 m2 H3 Gardens industrial hall, with the performance designed only for 35 spectators, added to the show intensity, providing the basis for a personal and imersive experience.In this context, the new BMW 4 Series Coupé was presented in a lighting installation located next to the Kaustik Nights concert stage. The installation only hinted at the shapes of the new model, it was an invitation to discovery. “We are a German brand built on technology, engineering and performance. With a slogan that celebrates 45 years and speaks of joy – “The sheer driving pleasure” – we are also a brand built on emotions and experiences. The BMW 4 Series Coupé illustrates very well this combination of technological excellence and the driving pleasure. Ars Electronica, with a dialogue between art and technology, and “Who Am I? A human-robot performance”, with a robot that has become a performance artist, we have an excellent setting that allows us to show the two facets of our brand. We are very happy that we were able to be part of this project, especially since in the foreground is a former BMW employee”, explains Dr Josef Reiter, Managing Director of BMW Group Romania.The new BMW 4 Series Coupé is a model defined by a bold design, dominated by a new front grille and a language of shapes with precisely contoured lines, but also harmoniously defined shape, almost organic. The unique design gives the new model a clear position in the BMW range, with a distinct identity. At the same time, the middle-class coupé has always been dedicated to driving pleasure, and the BMW 4 Series Coupé is perfectly prepared for this by specific proportions, perfect center of mass distribution, chassis rigidity, sophisticated TwinPower Turbo engine technology. But performance comes with respect for the environment: respecting the brand's sustainable development philosophy, power is delivered efficiently - all engines, except the top of the range petrol, the availability of 48V mild-hybrid technology and compliance with Euro 6d emissions standards.The collaboration of BMW and “Who Am I? A human-robot performance” continues with the preparation of a short film about the meeting between creator and creation – this time with the Kuka robot in the position of creator, and BMW 4 Series Coupé as the object of creation. The project aims to explore the spectacular design of the new model in the emotionally charged space of “Who Am I? A human-robot performance” performance art, building on the double identity of the Kuka robot – from a production tool in a BMW factory to an artist.Project Credits \/ AcknowledgementsConcept - H3 & Adrian Damian \/ Director and writer - Alexandru Berceanu \/ Scenography - Adrian Damian \/ Coreography - Andrea Gavrilu \/ Motion design - Andrei Mitișor, Sebastian Comănescu \/ Video design - Dilmana Yordanova, Ovidiu Eftimie \/ Light design - Cristian Șimon, Răzvan Pascu \/ Music & Sound Design featuring the voice of the artist - Kinga Ötvös \/ Costumes - Luiza Enescu \/ Performers: Andrea Gavrilu, Mădălina Ciotea, Vlad Bîrzanu, Anda Saltelechi, Meda Victor, Eduard Trifa \/ Video engineer - Silviu Bratosin, Luca Achim \/ Stage manager - Dan Iosif \/ Project coordinator - Cristina Tudor \/ Scenography Assistant - Andrei Șova \/ Videographers - Adi Bulboacă, Sorin Florea \/ Video editor - Florina Titz \/ Making-of - Marius Beșu \/ Producers - Florin Niculae, Ana Țecu, Ana Ciobanu, Anita Nițulescu \/ Production manager - Roxana Cozma \/ Communication manager - Sînziana Boaru Gîrjob \/ PR & Media relations - Bianca CenușeAlexandru SeremetBMW Group RomaniaCorporate Communication ManagerTelephone: +40-726-266-224About BMW Group Cultural EngagementFor almost 50 years now, the BMW Group has initiated and engaged in over 100 cultural cooperations worldwide.

{"prompt":"Exclusive special model in honour of the victorious driver commemorates the first triumph of the classic Mini at the legendary Monte Carlo Rally in 1964 – Edition available from October 2020 onwards in selected markets as MINI Cooper S 3-door, MINI Cooper S 5-door and MINI John Cooper Works. ->","completion":" Munich. 56 years have passed, but memories of the great triumph achieved by the small car with the starting number 37 have hardly faded. In 1964, the classic Mini Cooper S clinched the first of three overall victories at the legendary Monte Carlo Rally. At the wheel: the then 30-year-old Northern Irish rally driver Patrick “Paddy” Hopkirk. In his honour, MINI now presents an edition model with exclusive design and equipment features to mark one of the most spectacular achievements in the history of international motor racing. One unmistakable reminder of Hopkirk’s coup in the classic Mini is the winning car’s start number 37, which is featured in stylised form on the driver and passenger doors of the edition model.The MINI Paddy Hopkirk Edition is available in selected automobile markets from October 2020 as the MINI Cooper S 3-door , the MINI Cooper S 5 door and the MINI John Cooper Works . Like the famous starting number and the powerful engine, the body finish in Chili Red and the white roof of the edition model are inspired by the historical model.Hopkirk’s victorious run in the Mini Cooper S was frenetically celebrated by spectators on site and motor racing fans in the UK. Driving the small British car with his English co-pilot Henry Liddon, Hopkirk overcame the odds against competitors with significantly greater engine power. The handicap formula in force at the time meant that differences in weight and output within the starting field were compensated to a certain extent. But the crucial factors in the challenging chase over country roads and mountain passes, through ice snow, round tight corners and down steep slopes were the agility and reliability of the Mini Cooper S and Hopkirk’s driving skills.The surprise win in Monte Carlo made Paddy Hopkirk the UK’s most famous rally driver overnight. At the same time, the classic Mini advanced from outsider and crowd pleaser to being a motor racing legend. This status was underpinned in the years that followed when the Mini Cooper S dominated the Monte Carlo Rally. Hopkirk’s Finnish team mates Timo Mäkinen and Rauno Aaltonen added two more outright victories to the title collection in 1965 and 1967. The winning streak at the Monte Carlo Rally continues to inspire MINI fans all over the world to this day. With the MINI Paddy Hopkirk Edition, they now have the opportunity to express their passion for racing in a particularly authentic way.The edition model combines its exterior paintwork in the style of the historic rally winner in a market-specific manner with 17-inch John Cooper Works light-alloy wheels in Track Spoke Black design or 18-inch John Cooper Works light-alloy forged wheels in Cross Spoke Jet Black matt design and numerous other accentuations in dark colours. The frame and horizontal brace of the radiator grille are finished in high-gloss black, as are the inserts for the lower air intakes, the opening in the bonnet, the door handles, the fuel filler flap, the tailgate handle, the MINI logos at the front and rear as well as the surrounds for the headlights and rear lights.The start number 37 also appears on the side indicator elements known as side scuttles. Other unmistakable features on the exterior are the LED headlights and the rear lights in Union Jack design, stickers with the inscription “Paddy Hopkirk Monte Carlo” and a single white bonnet stripe on the driver’s side, which like the tailgate of the edition model bears the signature of the 1964 “Monte” winner. In addition, the famous number and letter combination 33 EJB of the number plate of the 1964 Monte Carlo winning car is shown on the bonnet strip using 3D effect graphics.Hopkirk’s signature also appears on the decorative trim strip on the passenger side, which forms part of the Piano Black high-gloss interior surfaces. Another exclusive design feature is the MINI LED entry sills bearing the name “Paddy Hopkirk”. The MINI Excitement Package and Comfort Access are also included in the MINI Paddy Hopkirk Edition. A market-specific configuration also includes auxiliary headlights in Piano Black, a key cap with the start number 37 and the Waistline Finisher in Piano Black for the trim strips between the body and the greenhouse. In addition, the edition model can be tailored to the driver‘s personal style so as to create an entirely unique specimen. To optimise driving pleasure, comfort and individual style, almost all items are available from the range of optional extras for the MINI 3-door and MINI 5-door. \n"}

The tide has turned with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team successfully completing the first ever FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) weekend at Barcelona (ESP) with a strong performance in the second race. In race two on Sunday afternoon, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Eugene Laverty (IRL) finished in fifth and seventh positions with their BMW S 1000 RRs. This represented the best result in a main race this season for both riders. Sykes started the Superpole race on Sunday morning from third place before falling back to cross the finish line in ninth. His team-mate Laverty finished eleventh, missing out on the top ten by just four-thousandths of a second. The results saw them starting the second main race in the afternoon from ninth and twelfth places. When the lights went out at 15:00 local time, both BMW riders immediately moved up a few positions; Sykes moved into seventh place, with Laverty right behind him in eighth. Sykes remained in seventh until the penultimate lap, when he moved up to sixth place after the retirement of Michael Ruben Rinaldi (ITA). Sykes continued to apply pressure during the final lap, passing Scott Redding (GBR) to claim fifth position. Laverty was involved in a dauntless battle with Alex Lowes (GBR) and Leon Haslam (GBR) for long periods of the race before making a great overtaking manoeuvre to pass him on the 16th lap. In the closing stage, Laverty was able to pull away from the riders behind him and was never in danger of surrendering his seventh place. WorldSBK now moves on to France where the seventh and penultimate race weekend of the season will take place at Magny-Cours in two weeks . Quotes after race two at Barcelona. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “That was a great relief after our weekend at Barcelona got off to a difficult start. After the reliability issues on Saturday, it was good to finish the Sunday with our best race results of the season. We have been striving for results like this for a long time and it is great to have achieved that - even if it does not yet open up the path to the top. We performed well in warm-up but Tom’s pace in Superpole was too slow at the beginning, which resulted in a slightly disappointing ninth place. However, both Tom and Eugene made a good start to the second race and both of them made it through the turmoil in the first corners. Tom was able to pull away a bit with the leading group and Eugene was involved in a great battle with Lowes and Haslam before coming out on top by finishing seventh. Tom lost contact with the top six around the halfway point of the race but was able to maintain his pace through to the finish and was able to move up to fifth on the final lap, ahead of Redding and Eugene. Now is not the time to relax but we will take this positive development with us to Magny-Cours and we hope that we can repeat our performance there.” Tom Sykes: “It’s been a refreshing change today. We managed to get some good consistent laps under our belts this afternoon on the BMW S 1000 RR. We didn’t have the pace at the beginning of the race, we couldn’t get the mechanical grip compared to what the other guys had but, what we were able to do was play with the electronics and my riding style throughout the race and keep a consistent pace, which is what we did well. Unfortunately, we were not able to get the result we wanted in yesterday’s race, but we certainly learned from that so to get fifth today is a step in the right direction. I’m really looking forwards to Magny-Cours in a few weeks’ time. This morning in warm-up with a cooler track temperature, the performance from me and the bike was much easier so hopefully heading to France will accommodate me and the BMW S 1000 RR.” Eugene Laverty: “I made a good start from P12 on the grid in race two and found myself in P8 at the end of lap one. That made my life a lot easier, but it was a tough old race as I was having vibrations coming from both front a rear tyre, so that made it difficult which is disappointing in that aspect as I know the potential could have been much more. Barcelona has suited the BMW S 1000 RR, even in race one yesterday again our potential was so much more but losing that much time in the opening laps was difficult to bridge the gap to guys ahead. Magny-Cours in France will be an unknown for me as I have not ridden a bike like the BMW S 1000 RR around there before. But that is expected; this year was always going to be a learning curve for both me and the bike.” \n"}

Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM) crossed the finish line in twelfth position, just ahead of 13th-placed Lucas Auer (AUT) in the BMW Bank M4 DTM. Having started the race from sixth on the grid, van der Linde lost two places at the start but was able to reclaim them in the opening stages of the race. The South African driver continued to gain ground after his pit stop on lap 13, passing Ferdinand Habsburg (AUT, Audi) and Wittmann to move into fourth place. Victory in the twelfth DTM race of 2020 went to Nico Müller (SUI, Audi). In the drivers’ standings, van der Linde has climbed to fourth position and remains the best-placed BMW driver with 88 points.

We have to recognise that Nico Müller, Robin Frijns and René Rast represent the benchmark this year. Nonetheless, Sheldon van der Linde and Marco Wittmann gave good performances in fourth and fifth positions. Congratulations to Nico Müller on the race win and to Audi on winning the manufacturers’ title. We will now concentrate on producing a few highlights over the course of the upcoming race weekends.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 5th, Race: 5th, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 86 points):“I had a good start and a good opening stage, in which I was able to overtake Ferdinand Habsburg. I was actually pretty happy to be driving behind the front three. Unfortunately, we lost the race a bit due to the pit stop strategy when Sheldon overtook us with his undercut. It is a bit disappointing to give your all during the first stint and then lose a place during the pit stop. Third place yesterday, fifth today - all in all, that’s OK.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 8th, Race: 8th, Driver’s standings: 8th, 73 points):“The balance was pretty OK but I just didn’t have the top speed on the straights. We have had this problem for the last three races and we are a bit trapped. It means that we always have to use the DRS very early in the race to keep up. In the end, we couldn’t have done much better than eighth place.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 9th, Race: 13th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 36 points):“I was in tenth place and came out right at the back of the field after the pit stop. The pit stop went well but I think that we will have to analyse the strategy again. Many of our competitors used the undercut to overtake us. We know that it is difficult to overtake the Audis. If you lose a lot of positions, of course that makes it very difficult. But qualifying was a lot better today, at least.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 10th, Race: 12th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 43 points):“Yesterday’s race was great and today it was really bad. My weapons were blunt today and I could not put up a fight. I had no balance, the car was very restless and, all in all, it was much worse than yesterday.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 13th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 33 points):“Of course, you can’t be satisfied with tenth place. It is some consolation that we did at least manage to move up from 13th place to finish in the points. We had great racing pace yesterday but that seemed to disappear a bit today. We will continue to battle away nonetheless.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 6th, Race: 4th, Drivers’ standings: 4th, 88 points):“I am very pleased with today’s race. Finishing sixth in qualifying was very important for the race. I didn’t make a good start and lost some positions, but I was able to reclaim them. The car drove really well today and the pace was very good. The strategy was also really good. We pitted early and the undercut worked out. That meant that we had a very long second stint but the car felt great all the way to the finish.”\n"}

The twelfth DTM race of the 2020 season will take place on Sunday. Reactions to the eleventh DTM race of the 2020 season. Rudolf Dittrich (General Manager BMW Motorsport Vehicle Development):“That was a great team performance with the podium for Marco Wittmann, fourth place for Philipp Eng and a total of five BMW M4 DTMs in the top-ten. Congratulations to everyone on this excellent Saturday of racing. I am not just pleased with the result itself, but with the fact that our speed in qualifying was much more competitive and we were able to battle the Audis on an even footing throughout the whole race. That shows that our work since last week has paid off. The race was very eventful and there were some unnecessarily hard manoeuvres. I am looking forward to tomorrow’s race, where we want to build on today’s performance. Congratulations to Robin Frijns on the win.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 6th, Race: 3rd, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 76 points):“Of course, that was a very positive day. I started from sixth place and finished third. I had a good start. The clutch problems from last week seem to have been dealt with. It was an exciting race with three safety car periods. We were able to benefit from two of those to move up a few places but then the final safety car probably cost us the second place. It looked like being in second place at the restart put us at a disadvantage. Exactly the same thing happened to René with the preceding safety car so it’s a bit of a shame but third place is absolutely OK. Reaching the podium from our starting position is a success.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 10th, Race: 10th, Driver’s standings: 8th, 69 points):“My race was actually pretty much over on lap one after I was hit from behind on the right by Loïc Duval. That meant that we didn't have the right balance any more. We were also unlucky with the pit stop, when I had to wait and then fell back to the end of the field with Lucas. After that, I tried to battle my way forward and score one point at least. Of course, I am delighted for the BMW Team RMG and Marco on the podium finish.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 15th, Race: 12th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 36 points):“The first stint was OK. However, I fell back a bit due to the pit stop. After that, I had contact with another driver and that damaged my car pretty badly. Unfortunately, we just can’t get the point where I feel 100% at ease. That makes it difficult, of course.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 4th, Race: 4th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 43 points):“The car was really great. It was a bit unlucky with the safety car. It would have worked out perfectly for us if the safety car had appeared one lap earlier but it is how it is. That meant that I lost one place due to the pit stop, which prevented me from reaching the podium.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 5th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 32 points):“All in all, I think that was a really strong race for BMW with Marco in third place, Philipp in fourth and me in sixth position. We definitely closed the gap that had been there last weekend. That is very pleasing. Personally, I didn't make a good start and I also lost another place on the second restart. However, our overall pace was great. I am looking forward to tomorrow.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 11th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 76 points):“What a race. Three safety cars - some of them went in my favour, but the final one did not. Some of the guys just don't show enough respect out on the track. That is a bit annoying as it cost us the sixth place. After starting from eleventh on the grid, things did look very promising for a while but at the end we did unfortunately lose a few positions and points.”\n"}

Shortly afterwards, he was forced to head for the pits due to a technical problem and then retire from the race. His team-mate Laverty finished Superpole in twelfth position. Laverty was able to move up at the start but then lost some positions to fall back to 16th for a while.

We are struggling with problems that occur sporadically and we have not yet been able to get the bottom of these issues or to fully understand them. We will be changing the complete system for tomorrow. Eugene also had a small technical problem with the tank ventilation at the start of the race, which meant that he could not match the pace to start with. However, he was able to catch up in the closing stage and at least he managed to reach eleventh place. In summary: from their speed, both riders could have achieved much more but some unacceptable defects prevented this. We will do everything to discover the reasons for this and avoid further disappointments.” Eugene Laverty: “It was a disappointing day. After the rain before Superpole, the track was incredibly slippery in the dry conditions, so we could not find any grip and qualified down in P12. During the opening lap of the race I found myself in tenth, which was okay, but unfortunately we had a technical problem as every time on the straight I was getting covered in fuel spray from the ventilation of the full tank so I couldn’t see properly. As a result, I was losing half a second per lap, but I didn’t want to give up. It takes a lot for me to throw the towel in and I wanted to keep going. Fortunately, whenever the fuel load came down, the fuel pressure issue went away so I was able to manage the issue until the end of the race and grab 11th.” Tom Sykes: “Unfortunately, it’s been a bit of a challenging day. We had an issue at the beginning of Superpole which was far from ideal, and as the track had been wet earlier in the session and was drying out, we needed the track time to understand the limitations of the circuit before putting the qualifying tyre on. Luckily, we were able to salvage a decent lap time on the BMW S 1000 RR even after a few mistakes and were able to start in fourth position. In yesterday’s free practice, we did a lot of work towards the race, so we felt well prepared in the dry and wet conditions. So I was looking forward to the race. Unfortunately, on the sighting lap we suffered again with another electrical issue. Obviously I tried riding the first few laps to see if I could slot into a position but the bike was unmanageable with no traction control and there was a bit of inconsistency on engine braking. By that point I had lost that many places it was pointless staying out so I decided to come in to try fix the issue so that at least we could collect some data along the way. That was not to be. There’s work to be done but we will keep focused and try gather some momentum going into tomorrow’s two races.” \n"}

It’s also the 50th anniversary of the first of 19 BMW overall wins in total at the Nordschleife. For this very special race, BMW M Motorsport and the BMW M customer racing teams will be represented by a squad that is as strong as it is diverse – from the battle for the overall win with the BMW M6 GT3, through to the BMW Junior Team in the BMW M4 GT4 and the BMW M2 CS Racing media car, to the numerous customer teams that will take on the ‘Green Hell’ challenge in a wide range of BMW racing cars. “The history of the 24-hour race is inextricably linked with the history of BMW at the Nordschleife. Even though we are celebrating our joint anniversary in the challenging context of the pandemic, the incredibly great importance that this track and this event has for us is clear once again this year,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “I am proud that we represent more than one quarter of the entire starting grid with a total of 27 BMW racing cars registered. And the variety of our entry is particularly remarkable. We are battling for our 20th overall win with the BMW M6 GT3, see the BMW Junior Team and some BMW M customer racing teams in the BMW M4 GT4, are using the new BMW M2 CS Racing as the media car and can also look forward to seeing numerous other BMW racing car models in action in the hands of our customers. I’m really excited for the racing that we will see there, and I’d like to thank all the track marshals in advance who are making this event possible through volunteering. It’s a real shame that we are unable to celebrate this anniversary in the usual way with hundreds of thousands of fans around the Nordschleife.” BMW M6 GT3: Tom Blomqvist makes comeback for ROWE Racing.As announced a few weeks ago, five BMW M6 GT3s will contest the highest class, SP9, four of which will be battling for the overall win in the PRO category. BMW Team Schnitzer, ROWE Racing and Walkenhorst Motorsport are deploying top-class drivers, including numerous BMW works drivers. Tom Blomqvist (GBR) has joined the ROWE Racing squad. He represented the team from St. Ingbert (GER) last year. Now the opportunity has arisen to make use of his speed and experience once again. Blomqvist shares the cockpit of the #98 BMW M6 GT3 with the three BMW DTM drivers Lucas Auer (AUT), Philipp Eng (AUT) and Marco Wittmann (GER). Eng will also be in action in the #99 sister car alongside Nick Catsburg (NED), Alexander Sims (GBR) and Nick Yelloly (GBR). BMW Team Schnitzer will be represented by Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jens Klingmann (GER), Martin Tomczyk (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA). In Walkenhorst Motorsport’s pro car, Mikkel Jensen (DEN), Christian Krognes (NOR), Jordan Pepper (RSA) and David Pittard (GBR) will take it in turns at the wheel. Martin Tomczyk (BMW Team Schnitzer): “First off, we are happy that we are even able to have the race in the context of the pandemic. Many thanks to the organisers and helpers for this! We have a great team and great drivers at Schnitzer. I think we are well-prepared, and our goal is definitely the overall win. The last BMW success was ten years ago now. It would be nice to be able to repeat this on this anniversary. Unfortunately last year’s painful experience showed us just how long 24 hours can be, which is why our approach for this year is to not make any mistakes, keep driving and then see where we are in the closing phase. This race is a major challenge every year, but I am confident that we will master it.” Sheldon van der Linde (BMW Team Schnitzer): “I think we have a fantastic squad with BMW Team Schnitzer and my three driver colleagues. Like some of the other BMW DTM drivers I will be competing at the Nürburgring three weekends in a row, which will no doubt be demanding. But I have never won the 24-hour race. That is definitely high up on my bucket list so I’m looking forward to the race.” Philipp Eng (ROWE Racing): “I’m really looking forward to the 24-hour race and would like to thank BMW for placing their trust in me to drive in two cars. It will be my first time. On one hand it means more work and driving time, but on the other hand it means double the chance of a good result. I think that we’re well-prepared. Now it will be all about coming through well and not making any mistakes.” Marco Wittmann (ROWE Racing): “For us as DTM drivers, naturally September is demanding with four race weekends in a row. Personally, I always try to use the Mondays and Tuesdays to try and recharge my batteries a bit. That works quite well for me, and as a racing driver your favourite place to be is behind the wheel anyway. I’m really looking forward to the upcoming DTM weekend first and then the 24-hour race.” Lucas Auer (ROWE Racing): “I’m incredibly excited about my first 24-hour race at the Nordschleife but I’m also a little bit nervous if I’m being honest. The track is absolutely legendary. I can’t wait to get started.” Tom Blomqvist (ROWE Racing): “I’m delighted that the opportunity arose to represent BMW M Motorsport at the 24 Hours Nürburgring again. I’ve been involved in this fantastic race a few times already, I know the BMW M6 GT3 and the team so I think that I have enough experience to be able to help the team. We have a very strong team with which we will hopefully be able to get a good result.” Mikkel Jensen (Walkenhorst Motorsport): “We have high expectations for the 24-hour race. We have an incredibly strong package for a customer team and have shown good performances in the races in the Nürburgring Endurance Series season to date. I myself and Jordan Pepper as the new driver in the team might be lacking a bit of experience, but we should still be well-positioned. I’m looking forward to my first real 24-hour race at the Nordschleife after I didn’t get to drive much last year.” BMW Junior Team: Debut at wheel of the BMW M4 GT4.For the BMW Junior Team newly formed in 2020, the 24-hour race is the first major highlight of their training at the Nordschleife. Since the pandemic situation has allowed, Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) having been living together in a shared house right at the Nürburgring and have been taking part in every race in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS). They completed the first three races in the BMW M240i Racing to get their Nordschleife licence. Harper and Verhagen celebrated a class win. Since the fourth round of the NLS, they have been in action in the Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M4 GT4, in which they will also contest the 24-hour race. Max Hesse: “We are preparing intensively for our first 24-hour race and can’t wait for it to get started. We’re currently in the simulator and practising driving at night, for example. We’re also being coached on when and what is best to eat during the race. Lots will be new to us, and the main thing will be to make optimum use of the training in the days leading up to the race and then try to get through the 24 hours without making any mistakes or coming into contact with any of the other cars.” Dan Harper: “All three of us have our first 24-hour race ahead of us and are incredibly excited. I think that there is no better place for a 24-hour debut than the Nürburgring. We are aware of the huge challenge ahead of us. Just the 6-hour race a few weeks ago was a big step for us. Now to drive 24 hours non-stop will be an incredible experience. We have prepared ourselves as well as we could. But for me personally the biggest challenge will be driving at night for the first time in my role as a racing driver. I’ll have to get used to it very quickly.” Neil Verhagen: “It will also be my first time driving at night. I’m super excited because I’ve heard from many other drivers that it’s very special. As part of our preparation we are planning a twelve-hour test in our simulator at home. Each of us will drive stints in the night and we will test what it’s like adjusting our sleep patterns. During our training sessions, in addition to fitness we also worked on our concentration and vision in the dark. Now I hope that we’ll be able to make use of it all in the race.” BMW M2 CS Racing: First outing as media car.The BMW M2 CS Racing is the latest car in the BMW M customer racing range and makes its debut at the 24-hour race as the media car with a very special anniversary design. The cockpit will be shared by BMW works driver Dirk Adorf (GER), racing driver Tom Coronel (NED) and the two journalists Christian Gebhardt (GER) and Niki Schelle (GER). The design evokes memories of every past BMW victory. The blue and white livery pays homage to the first winning car in 1970 and is complemented by present-day BMW M Motorsport design elements on the bonnet. The media car is in action for Pixum CFN Team Adrenalin Motorsport. BMW M customer racing teams make for a diverse starting field.A total of 27 BMW racing cars have registered for the 24-hour race. Of the current BMW M customer racing cars, the BMW M6 GT3 will contest the SP9 PRO and SP9 AM classes. The BMW M4 GT4 will race in the SP10 and SP8T classes, the BMW M2 CS Racing in its own BMW M2 class and the BMW M240i Racing in the CUP5 category. There are also other BMW racing cars such as the BMW 325i in the V4 and SP4 classes and the BMW 330i in the V2T class.\n"}

BMW i Motorsport has its own exhibition area, in which exhibits include the BMW iFE.20 and a BMW i drivetrain from the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. Visitors to the Greentech Festival have the opportunity to take a close look at both the car, with which BMW i Andretti Motorsport won three races in the last Formula E season, and the highly-efficient BMW i drivetrain – Racing eDrive02. Within the BMW Group, the BMW i FE.20 serves as a tech lab for future generations of electrified and electric vehicles. The technology transfer between motor racing and production development is a central pillar of BMW i Motorsport’s involvement in Formula E. Within a technological cycle, the BMW i engineers developing future production drivetrains benefit hugely from the technical knowledge acquired through the extreme application of this technology in Formula E. For those visitors to the Greentech Festival who are not just interested in the theory behind these future technologies, the state-of-the-art Fanatec racing simulators at the exhibition site are another major attraction. Here, you can have an incredibly realistic experience of how it feels to be at the steering wheel of the BMW iFE.20 fully-electric race car. The simulation on the virtual Formula E racetrack at Berlin-Tempelhof is so realistic that Formula E drivers used it to go head to head in the ‘ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge’ when the coronavirus pandemic forced a break in racing. The closeness to reality, as well as the future-oriented technologies and concepts, are among the reasons why BMW Motorsport SIM Racing has become a central pillar of the BMW Motorsport programme, along with real racing series. Another highlight of the exhibition area is the BMW i3 Urban Suite. With this car, the BMW Group is presenting a mobility experience completely tailored to the individual needs of its passengers. To make this possible, a production BMW i3 has been completely redesigned, with the exception of the driver’s seat and dashboard, giving the interior a similar relaxed atmosphere to that of a boutique hotel.\n"}

The maiden season of the newly established sim racing series V10 R-League is underway. On the first two match days BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Team delivered one win and one defeat. Three of the four team members are in action on each match day and do battle for the win against some of the biggest names in sim racing in three different race formats. For BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Team, Team Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO), Cem Bölükbasi (TUR) of BS+COMPETITION and Coque Lopéz (ESP) of Williams Esports contested the first two events. These are made up of three race formats: Head-to-Head, Relay Race and Team Race using a virtual single-seater car developed specially for the race series. At the opener, BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Team was defeated by the Porsche24 Redline team while on match day two a clear 3-0 victory over JAESA Team Suzuki followed. Siggy’s wealth of experience of the sim racing platform Assetto Corsa saw him secure the BMW victory and nominated ‘Driver of the Day’ among the drivers of all eight teams on match day two. In an interview, Siggy talks about his return to the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing family and the special challenges of the V10 R-League. Kevin, after winning the ‘ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge’ in the virtual BMW iFE.20, welcome back to the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing family!Kevin Siggy: “Thank you very much! I feel honoured that those in charge at BMW Motorsport SIM Racing selected me as a driver for the V10 R-League after the ‘Race at Home Challenge’. It’s an important step in my career as a sim racer.” How have your first experiences with your colleagues at BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Team been?Siggy: “We have a lot of fun together. It’s cool training with them and chatting during the sessions and races. It’s important in the V10 R-League to work as well together as possible as a team, which we’re working on.” What does that work look like?Siggy: “I am the one in the team with the most experience on Assetto Corsa, so I coach my team-mates and give them tips wherever I can. Personally, I mainly drive on the rFactor 2 platform. The transition from there to Assetto Corsa is relatively easy, as long as you have driven on the platform before. For the others, for whom Assetto Corsa is totally new, it is much harder to learn all the tricks for being fast. It’s particularly difficult to adapt to the totally different driving physics if you are coming from iRacing.” What was your highlight at the team’s first win on match day two?Siggy: “Definitely the Team Race. My team-mates consistently kept the car in the top four, and I only had to observe to keep up with the Suzuki driver leading on the track. We knew that he would be awarded a penalty for ignoring the track limits multiple times, which he was, and we won. I also drove my fastest time in that race, which made me ‘Driver of the Day’. How is it driving the car developed specially for the V10 R-League?Siggy: “I’m not a huge fan of single-seater cars generally, but I was pleasantly surprised by the handling of this car. I really enjoyed racing in it. The preconfigured set-up in particular makes it easy to drive. The V10 engine is also pretty cool. The only problem is the tyres at times, which overheat quickly.” How is your sim racing career going otherwise at the moment?Siggy: “It’s going very well. I’m still under contract at Team Redline, and we already have a few plans for the future.Also I am still driving for BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Team in the V10 R-League. We’ll see how things progress. I definitely really enjoy racing for BMW.”\n"}

After several minor modifications, the track is now 4.655 kilometres long. It is primarily known as a Formula 1 racetrack, but MotoGP and national motorcycle series also race there. WorldSBK is now set to make its debut there this year. Quotes ahead of the race weekend at Barcelona. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We are very excited about the WorldSBK debut in Barcelona. ‘Circuit de Catalunya’ is definitely a great addition to the calendar. At the test in July, we were able to familiarise ourselves with the characteristics of the circuit, which so far only had been on the schedule for the GP guys, together with Tom and Eugene. We gained valuable data which will help us regarding the base set up for our BMW S 1000 RR this weekend. The circuit is demanding, has a high proportion of full throttle and is hard on the brakes. It won’t be an easy task for the BMW S 1000 RR and the team, but Tom and Eugene both felt comfortable on the track at the test. Now we are looking forward to racing at Barcelona for the first time.” Tom Sykes: “I am definitely looking forward to the Barcelona race. The venue is fantastic; it’s a circuit that I always wanted to ride on. I then got the chance at the recent test there which in itself proved to be very, very useful. We were able to do quite a lot of testing there with our BMW S 1000 RR to get a lot of information plus it has also given us good track knowledge for the upcoming race weekend so I am very motivated to go there and carry on where we left off. I enjoy the track layout and I could see from the test that the bike was working really well in some sectors. The weather forecast itself is not looking too pleasant but given the fact of our previous results last year in wet conditions hopefully we can use that to our advantage if that’s the case.” Eugene Laverty: “I feel very confident and optimistic ahead of the Barcelona race weekend for two reasons. First off we had a great test at the Catalunya circuit in July and on top of that I feel that we made huge strides forward in the understanding of the BMW S 1000 RR last time out at Aragón. This year my focus has always been aimed towards 20 laps rather than one and finally I’m beginning to reap the fruits of my labour. We are now very close to finding that final piece of the puzzle to propel us up the order.” \n"}

In the tenth race of the DTM season, four BMW DTM works drivers made it into the top ten on the Nürburgring Grand Prix circuit (GER). However, they were unable to build on Saturday’s performance, when Marco Wittmann (GER, Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM) reached the podium. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) was the best-placed BMW driver, finishing in sixth place. Jonathan Aberdein (RSA, CATL BMW M4 DTM), Wittmann and Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM) crossed the finish line in positions eight, nine and ten. The qualifying session had already shown that it would be difficult to achieve another podium finish on the longer variant of the Nürburgring track. During the race, van der Linde used an early pit stop to move up to sixth position. Lucas Auer (AUT, BMW Bank M4 DTM) and Timo Glock (GER, iQOO BMW M4 DTM) finished in eleventh and 14th positions. Robert Kubica (POL), from the BMW customer team ART Grand Prix, secured ninth place on the grid in qualifying and finished the race in twelfth. Victory went to Robin Frijns (NED, Audi). Next weekend, the eleventh and twelfth races of the season will take place on the shorter Nürburgring sprint track. Reactions to the tenth DTM race of the 2020 season at the Nürburgring. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“That was a tough race after a difficult qualifying session. We had to work really hard after starting from those grid positions. We had to try a few things out with the strategy. Sheldon van der Linde did that really well and got close to the Audis, but there is a difference between getting there and actually being able to overtake. When you are chasing, the tyres deteriorate really quickly. Jonathan Aberdein also gave a strong race performance behind Sheldon. It's a shame that he dropped down another place in the duel with Jamie Green at the end. Marco Wittmann and Philipp Eng also finished in the points but unfortunately they didn’t have good grid positions. We don't want to be battling for fifth to tenth places, we want to be fighting for a podium, and to do that we really have to close the gap in qualifying. All the BMW drivers were close together but the gap to Audi was larger than it was on Saturday. We have to understand the reason for that. It is the grid position that determines how you get going in the race. The race pace is pretty good, but the lap speed is not. We will have to take a look at that. Congratulations to Robin Frijns on the win.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 10th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings: 8th, 61 points):“It is a bit disappointing, as we had problems with the clutch throughout the weekend. We didn't replace it between yesterday and today, which led to identical problems at the start. In general, it is difficult to regain three positions if you lose them right at the start. In the end, we were able to battle back pretty well but we could have done more if we’d started better, as our pace was generally OK.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 12th, Race: 14th, Driver’s standings: 7th, 68 points):“In general, that was a tough race for us. I don’t know exactly what caused that. Just like yesterday, I got stuck behind Philipp Eng for a few laps and then overtook him. He then managed to get back past me a bit later. I don't know why the tyres deteriorated so badly. We will have to take a look at the reasons for that and what we can do to improve.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 13th, Race: 11th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 36 points):“That was not a good weekend for us. I attempted to cover a potential safety car period. Tyre management was good but that strategy just doesn't work without a safety car appearing. In general, there is a lot we can improve on and that’s why I think next week should be OK.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 11th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 31 points):“Today’s race was a bit more difficult than yesterday’s. In general, we had more understeer with the car. The pace was not so good but our implementation was OK.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 8th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 24 points):“From my point of view, the race was actually OK. I started from eighth place and held on to that position. My strategy worked well but we were just lacking a bit of pace.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 7th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 72 points):“Personally speaking, I am very pleased. I think that today was a perfect race from a tactical point of view, and my pace. My start was not so good as I lost two positions but I got those back right away at the end of the lap. I am happy with the points that I scored for finishing sixth today, as the best BMW driver. Thanks to my team. Nonetheless, it hurts to see three Audis on the podium. We must make sure that we close the gap as I want to get back to the podium soon.”\n"}

He followed up a good qualifying session by driving a really good race, albeit with a little luck. Nico Müller was just different class today, but finishing with five BMWs in the top ten is a good result for us. We are slowly getting closer. Nonetheless, we have to make more progress and take another look at our pace management. All in all, we have continued to improve but it is not quite enough yet so we will be on the attack again tomorrow.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 4th, Race: 3rd, Drivers’ standings: 8th, 59 points):“It has been a good weekend for us so far. We were able to reach fourth place in the race and we also had a bit of luck that helped us reach the podium. Nonetheless, it is definitely satisfying to be able to stand on the podium again and to have scored some good championship points. Of course, we will be giving our all again on Sunday.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 12th, Race: 7th, Driver’s standings: 5th, 68 points):“The start went well. Things were really tight in turn one, which prevented me from moving up too many places. I had a relatively good first lap nonetheless and overall, the speed was spot on. I then finished the race behind Philipp. That was a bit of a shame, as I thought our speed was a little better. But overall, we can be really pleased with that.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 10th, Race: 12th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 36 points):“We had a few issues in qualifying and started the race from tenth on the grid. We then worked on the strategy and that gave us a real advantage with the tyres but we weren’t able to make the most of that. Now we have to analyse what happened but I am confident about Sunday’s race.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 9th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 30 points):“It was an interesting race and a lot of fun. I made a good start and had a good first lap. I think that was decisive in terms of the result. Then we were a bit unlucky that Robin Frijns spun out as I would probably have been able to overtake Mike Rockenfeller otherwise. But the car felt great and the result was good.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 16th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 20 points):“It was a tough race. After I went off the circuit during qualifying and broke something on the car, we had to start from the back of the grid. The first stint went very well and I made it up to twelfth place. We decided on an offensive strategy to move up further and in the end we did manage to score one point.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 6th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 64 points):“The race was OK. I didn't make the best start and then I lost a few places on the first three laps. Our strategy was not quite ideal. We still have some room for improvement there but we are confident about Sunday. Finishing eighth did at least mean that we scored some points. I am certainly happy with that.”\n"}

BMW M Motorsport and the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER) are celebrating a joint anniversary this year. 2020 marks 50 years since both the inaugural staging of the endurance classic and the first overall victory for BMW in the ‘Green Hell’. As no major anniversary event is possible in the current situation, BMW M Motorsport is recognising its Nordschleife history with a BMW M2 CS Racing media car, featuring a special livery. It will bear the names of all those drivers who were involved in BMW’s 19 overall victories. History and the future meet in the media car for the 50th anniversary of the Nürburgring 24 Hours. The design evokes memories of every past BMW victory. The blue and white livery pays homage to the first winning car in 1970 and is complemented by present-day BMW M Motorsport design elements on the bonnet. The BMW M2 CS Racing is one of the BMW M Customer Racing cars that are set to become synonymous with the future of BMW’s activities on the Nordschleife, together with the BMW M4 GT3, which is currently in its test phase, and the BMW M4 GT4. At the wheel of the BMW M2 CS Racing media car will be BMW works driver Dirk Adorf (GER) and fellow racing driver Tom Coronel (NED). They will share the cockpit with journalists Christian Gebhardt (GER) and Niki Schelle (GER). “The fact that we are celebrating the anniversary of both the 24-hour race and the first BMW victory, and that the 19 overall wins are listed on our Media Car, shows that BMW is the brand that has shaped this event more than any other over the decades,” said Adorf. “I am happy and proud that we will compete in the BMW M2 CS Racing with a high-quality quartet, which has all the skills required to make it through the race distance in good shape. We would all much prefer for the race to be held in front of our fans, but unfortunately that is not possible this year. Hopefully, this means there will be even greater media interest, which we will take into account with our BMW M2 CS Racing media car.” Stuck has claimed BMW victories across different eras.The design of the media car tells the story of the 19 overall victories for BMW, from the first success at the inaugural event in 1970 to the latest win in 2010. Legendary racing driver Hans-Joachim Stuck (GER) has played a major role in this story. He has won the 24-hour race three times with BMW. He won the inaugural race in 1970 alongside Clemens Schickentanz (GER) in the BMW 2002 TI. In 1998, he was part of the crew that claimed the first overall victory on the Nordschleife by a diesel car, with the BMW 320d. In 2004, he was joined on the top step of the podium by Dirk Müller, Jörg Müller (both GER) and Pedro Lamy (POR) after their success in the BMW M3 GTR. “I think it is fantastic that I have been able to experience several different eras of the 24-hour race together with BMW over the course of my career – from my first win in the BMW 2002 TI to a car like the BMW M3 GTR, which was state-of-the-art at the time,” said Stuck. “We were pioneers with the BMW 2002 TI. That was pure driving, without any form of driver aid. For me personally, this was my first big win and an important milestone in my career, which I rank very highly. When BMW told me in 1998 that they wanted to win the 24-hour race with a diesel, I said ‘Are you joking?’ However, the fuel consumption actually meant we were able to defeat the opposition. We were not the fastest, but we had to make far fewer pit stops. The most fun I had was in 2004 with the BMW M3 GTR. Driving that car on the Nordschleife – with its speed, all the technical driver aids and its reliability – was sensational. In my opinion, that was the best car I have ever driven at this circuit.” Farfus: Back for another crack, ten years after winning in the BMW M3 GT2.One of the drivers in BMW’s most recent victory, with the BMW M3 GT2 in 2010, was Augusto Farfus (BRA). Ten years later, the BMW works driver races in the BMW M6 GT3, as he looks to claim a 20th overall win for BMW. “I am very happy to have been involved in the victory with the BMW M3 GT2,” said Farfus. “Ten years later, it is about time we added another win to the list. Back then, the BMW M3 GT2 was the newest car in the field, and the car with the fewest test kilometres under its belt. Nowadays, our BMW M6 GT3 has done more kilometres of testing on the Nordschleife than all the other GT3 cars. The car and BMW Team Schnitzer have been through every conceivable situation and are really well prepared. We will do everything we can to claim the 20th victory for BMW.” BMW’s 19 overall victories at a glance: 1970: Hans-Joachim Stuck, Clemens Schickentanz, BMW 2002 TI Koepchen1971: Ferfried Prinz von Hohenzollern, Gerold Pankl, BMW 2002 Alpina1972: Helmut Kelleners, Gerold Pankl, BMW 2800 CS Alpina1973: Niki Lauda, Hans-Peter Joisten, BMW 3.0 CSL Alpina1984: Axel Felder, Franz-Josef Bröhling, Peter Oberndorfer, BMW 635 CSi1985: Axel Felder, Jürgen Hamelmann, Robert Walterscheid-Müller, BMW 635 CSi1986: Markus Oestreich, Otto Rensing, Winfried Vogt, BMW 325i1989: Emanuele Pirro, Roberto Ravaglia, Fabien Giroix, BMW M31990: Altfrid Heger, Joachim Winkelhock, Frank Schmickler, BMW M31991: Kris Nissen, Joachim Winkelhock, Armin Hahne, BMW M31992: Johnny Cecotto, Christian Danner, Jean-Michel Martin, Marc Duez, BMW M31994: Karl-Heinz Wlazik, Frank Katthöfer, Fred Rosterg, BMW M31995: Roberto Ravaglia, Marc Duez, Alexander Burgstaller, BMW 320i1996: Johannes Scheid, Sabine Reck, Hans Widmann, BMW M31997: Johannes Scheid, Sabine Reck, Hans-Jürgen Tiemann, Peter Zakowski, BMW M31998: Marc Duez, Andreas Bovensiepen, Christian Menzel, Hans-Joachim Stuck, BMW 320d2004: Pedro Lamy, Dirk Müller, Jörg Müller, Hans-Joachim Stuck, BMW M3 GTR2005: Boris Said, Duncan Huisman, Andy Priaulx, Pedro Lamy, BMW M3 GTR2010: Jörg Müller, Augusto Farfus, Uwe Alzen, Pedro Lamy, BMW M3 GT2 \n"}
{"prompt":"His tour-de-force at the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964 transformed the racing driver from Northern Ireland into the United Kingdom’s most illustrious rally driver and propelled the classic Mini to the status of motor-sport icon. Driving fun typical of the brand is still the passion of the racing driver, now 87 years old. And he continues to relish the challenge of winding country roads.  ->","completion":" Munich. The Ford Falcon was powered by eight cylinders and had a lead of 17 seconds. Paddy Hopkirk had stowed a can of caviar in the toolbox of his Mini Cooper S and he had just mastered the “Night of the Long Knives” in a rumbustious drive. In 1964, the Monte Carlo Rally was still a genuine adventure for all the competing racing drivers and the spectacle was broadcast live on television. This was the era when automobile manufacturers all over the world discovered rally sport as the perfect stage for presenting their models. And consequently, vehicles from different weight and performance classes competed against each other with a handicap formula providing appropriate compensation when allocating points. When Hopkirk, now 87 years old, talks about his tour-de-force driving the classic Mini with start number 37, the fascination of classic motor sport immediately comes alive.Today, Hopkirk can still get excited about the driving characteristics of the classic Mini. “The Mini was a very advanced motor car. Its front-wheel drive and the transversely mounted engine at the front presented significant advantages, just like the fact that the car was small given that the roads had lots of bends and were narrow,” explained the rally driver from Northern Ireland as he recalled his greatest triumph. When we met up at the foot of the Col de Turini, he slid in nimbly behind the steering wheel of a classic Mini. This time, the little car was styled in a livery of British Racing Green, there was no snow on the carriageway, and time was available to enjoy the magnificent landscape and the view of Monte Carlo nestling in the valley. But Hopkirk still finds the ideal line from the start and steers the classic Mini out of the bend with a broad smile and forceful pedal-to-metal acceleration. Driving fun comes back immediately, along with the memories of the event 56 years ago.Incidentally, the caviar originated from Minsk. In the winter of 1964, Hopkirk and his English co-pilot Harry Liddon started out from Minsk in the Monte Carlo Rally, which at that time commenced as a star rally from nine different European cities. The six Mini works cars and the other vehicles in the starter field only met up in Rheims, France. At that time, Patrick or “Paddy” Hopkirk was already able to look back on an impressive career in which he had won hillclimb races and come out victorious five times in the Circuit of Ireland. Hopkirk had also attracted attention in the Tulip Rally staged in the Netherlands, the Austrian Alpine Rally and the Safari Rally. In 1962, he crossed the finishing line driving a Sunbeam Rapier in third place in the overall placings of the Monte Carlo Rally. And because he had such a taste for adventure and had never driven on Soviet roads, Hopkirk registered voluntarily to start the race in Minsk in 1964.He started off successfully, and along the country roads in France a duel quickly developed between Hopkirk driving the Mini Cooper S and Swedish driver Bo Ljungfeldt in the Ford Falcon. The showdown came on the Col de Turini and this was destined to presage the ultimate outcome for the race. On the day before, there had been a big snowfall and this significantly slowed down powerful and heavy vehicles steered by competing drivers. However, this wasn’t the case for the little challenger. According to Hopkirk: “The Mini performed particularly well going downhill, and the tests had all been uphill and down dale so that we were able make good anything we lost going uphill when we were driving downhill.”Everything else was dealt with by the handicap formula. Ljungfeldt made up 17 seconds during the “Night of the Long Knives” and gained a lead of half a minute in the final circuit race on the Monte Carlo Grand Prix track, but this was not enough to displace Paddy Hopkirk from his position as number one in the overall placings. At the finishing line, it took some time before all the times had been compared and all the points had been totted up. However, ultimately the first overall victory achieved by the classic Mini in the Monte Carlo Rally was established.The surprising coup won acclaim worldwide, and feverish celebrations followed in the United Kingdom. The classic MINI became a motor-sport legend and Paddy Hopkirk shot to fame as the United Kingdom’s most illustrious rally driver overnight. After the winner’s podium ceremony, driver and vehicle were repatriated to the United Kingdom where they starred in the immensely popular TV show of the time, “Sunday Night at the London Palladium”. Fans, celebrities and even the British Government sent telegrams to convey their congratulations. Hopkirk’s most treasured memorabilia include an autograph card from the Beatles with the message: “Now you are one of us, Paddy!”The MINI Cooper S continued to dominate the Monte Carlo Rally in subsequent years. Hopkirk’s Finnish teammates Timo Mäkinen and Rauno Aaltonen, who had taken places four and seven in 1964, succeeded in driving the Mini Cooper S to second and third place in the overall standings in 1965 and 1967 respectively. Rally fans named the trio “The Three Musketeers”. In 2010, they were all welcomed as the first members of the Finnish “Rally Hall of Fame”.In 1967, Hopkirk took sixth place in the overall standings and in the following year he crossed the finishing line of the “Monte” in fifth place. However, it was inevitable that the golden era of this diminutive adventurous runabout was coming to an end, particularly since the competition had been busily working on developments. Hopkirk changed to other models and won a number of races including the Acropolis Rally. In 1968, Paddy Hopkirk highlighted his reputation as a fair sportsman and gentleman in the London-Sydney Marathon when he and his co-pilot Tony Nash stopped their Austin, which was in the lead, in order to rescue a team from their burning car that had been involved in a serious accident.At the beginning of the 1970s, Paddy Hopkirk retired from professional rallying and built up a career importing automobiles to his homeland of Northern Ireland and the sale of accessory products sold under the brand named after him. He was also involved in the relaunch of the MINI brand as a consultant to the BMW Group. The veteran rally driver still engages in a wealth of honorary activities to this day. During his active driving career, Hopkirk supported a large number of road safety campaigns and he is still involved today as an ambassador for the charity organisation IAM RoadSmart. His commitments also include working on the Board of Management of the British Racing Drivers’ Club and supporting WheelPower, an association dedicated to promoting wheelchair sport. In 2016, Paddy Hopkirk received the award of Member of the Order of the British Empire from Princess Anne. \n"}

On Sunday, BMW and Staatsoper Unter den Linden jointly invited to this year’s edition of “State Opera for All”. This was not only to celebrate the 250th birthday of Ludwig van Beethoven but also the 450th anniversary of the Staatskapelle Berlin. With 2,000 guests, “State Opera for All” 2020 was intended to thank everyone who contributed significantly and helped ensure vital services during the crisis.Following the protective guidelines for events, this year’s “State Opera for All” offered a reduced number of seats for a total of 2,000 spectators. The open-air concert was an important sign for the return of the culture. Additionally, it was meant as a token of appreciation offered to all those that provided indispensable support working in sectors crucial to the society such as healthcare services, retail and logistics. A share of the tickets was reserved for people working in any one of these sectors. All tickets available had been out of stock within minutes. Thanks to BMW Berlin, admission to the concert was offered again free of charge.The patronage of “State Opera for All” had been taken over by Berlin’s governing mayor Michael Müller. Furthermore, high-ranking representatives from the worlds of politics and business as well as virologist Prof. Dr Christian Drosten, actress Iris Berben and author Katja Eichinger took part as special guests. This year’s concert was moderated by ZDFkultur presenter Lisa Ruhfus.From 8.00 PM and on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven’s birth, the Staatskapelle Berlin performed two romances for violin with Anne-Sophie Mutter as soloist, the “Egmont” Overture and the Symphony No. 9, the “Ode to Joy”, with Julia Kleiter, Waltraud Meier, Andreas Schager and René Pape presenting the solo parts as well as the Staatsopernchor. The concert was available online via live stream. It will be broadcasted on the German TV channel ZDF on September 13, 2020 at 10.15 pm.“What an amazing feeling to perform at Bebelplatz in front of 2,000 people and to finally feel the audience’s energy again! Being part of this open-air concert that was first and foremost dedicated to all those whose efforts contributed significantly to our society over the previous months was particularly important to me”, said Anne-Sophie Mutter.Matthias Schulz, Director of the Staatsoper Unter den Linden: “We are back – and how! It was paramount for all of us at Staatsoper Unter den Linden to mark the return of great symphonic music, and above all to present a performance that included vocals and the Staatsopernchor. I am deeply grateful to our partners BMW and ZDF, together with whom we continued to believe in our initiative even when faced with the most difficult of circumstances. At Staatsoper Unter den Linden and in all of Berlin and its surroundings, we are all in need of such highly emotive symbols of solidarity and the shared experiences of cultural events”.“Staatsoper Unter den Linden and BMW started the series of open-air concerts, ‘State Opera for All’, in the historical center of Germany’s capital in 2007. Since then, we were able to welcome over half a million visitors to this great event at Bebelplatz. There were visibly less guests in front of this impressive setting, yesterday, as there were only 2,000 visitors allowed on the ground due to Covid-19. Therefore, we are even more delighted that this year’s concert could take place that way at all. During these uncertain times it is music that vigorously reminds us of the power humanity is capable of. I hope that ‘State Opera for All’ with Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’ has been an inspiring symbol during these challenging times. It was a special honor to welcome lots of people working in sectors crucial to the society and who helped with their social engagement. We are thankful for their tireless commitment”, said Sebastian Mackensen, BMW Group Senior Vice President Market Germany.In 2020, Staatskapelle Berlin celebrates its 450th anniversary and marks this special occasion over the course of the seasons 2019\/2020 and 2020\/2012. With a tradition reaching back to 1570, the Staatskapelle Berlin is one of the oldest orchestras in the world. Daniel Barenboim was appointed general music director of the Staatskapelle in 1992.For almost 50 years, BMW Group has supported hundreds of cultural institutions worldwide. The cooperation with Staatsoper Unter den Linden is an integral part of a broad range of partnerships of BMW Group and various concert halls and ensembles from all over the world ranging from South Africa to China. The partnerships include a series of open-air concerts held in Munich and at London’s Trafalgar Square and, since 2018, in Moscow.#SOFA2020#BMWOperaNext #StaatsoperUnterDenLinden#BMWGroupCulture \n"}

The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK team ended the double-header at MotorLand Aragón (ESP) with the Superpole race and race two on Sunday. The racetrack near Alcañiz hosted the fourth and fifth events of the FIM Superbike World Championship season. In the Superpole race, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Eugene Laverty (IRL) finished in P9 and P14 on their BMW S 1000 RRs. In the second main race, Laverty finished in eleventh. For Sykes, a minor technical issue had a major impact and he was unable to compete. Sykes started the sprint race on Sunday morning from fourth on the grid but lost positions over the ten laps and crossed the finish line in ninth place. Laverty, who started from 16th on the grid, made up two places and was in 14th at the chequered flag. For the second main race in the afternoon, that meant ninth on the grid for Sykes and 16th for Laverty. When the field completed the warm-up lap from the starting grid, Sykes’ quickshifter failed. Instead of being able to return to the grid, he had to head for the pit and his race was over before it could really get started. From 16th on the grid, Laverty put pressure on the riders in front of him as he had done on Saturday, and got embroiled in several duels. That saw him pick up further points for finishing eleventh after 20 laps. Quotes after race two at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Despite the disappointing results today, we were able to gain additional knowledge this weekend and find a set-up to be better prepared for these conditions despite our known deficits. That’s the positive thing that we will take with us into the next races. Eugene had a solid race again, especially in the afternoon. Unfortunately, Tom had bad luck with the quickshifter. He had to go back to the pits, and as that stop lasted longer than the first lap of the race, we were no longer allowed to start according to the regulations. I hope that we have now had our share of bad luck. We look ahead and keep working hard.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The Superpole Race was not so bad for Tom. I was quite happy with the way he rode, we cured the issue of the lap time dropping in latter stages and he rode a very consistent race, in the end he consolidated his ninth and got himself ninth on the grid for race two. Eugene started to come through at the end of the sprint race and maybe given a few a more laps could have been on for another top eight. The final race of the weekend was a disaster for Tom. Unfortunately, he was forced out the race with a quickshifter issue which we cannot quite understand yet. That will be investigated in due course. For Eugene, he went out with the X tyre in the race, again a similar outcome in the fact that with a few more laps he quite possibly could have got another top eight, but it’s another day of what could have been. We will go away, investigate, and come back stronger for Barcelona.” Eugene Laverty: “This morning’s short race was not going to suit me today as I came strong in the latter stage of yesterday’s race one, so it was always going to be a challenge to get myself further up the field. For the final race of the weekend I was optimistic, but unfortunately it seemed that others were able to maintain their pace better. We need to find a way to use the rear tyre in the same way our competition does, but while it may not look it on paper, we have made huge progress in these last six days at Motorland Aragón. The bike is starting to work really well; there is just one final piece of the puzzle which is to really extract everything from the rear tyre, which I’m sure we can get to in Barcelona.” Tom Sykes: “Credit to the boys, we made a lot of small adjustments from yesterday and I have to say I was very comfortable with the bike. In the sprint race, it was clear to see where our disadvantage was but given the nature of the track, I was impressed with how the chassis was working. I really feel that we understood our limitations well, and for that I am happy. We certainly gave away some straight-line performance which was difficult to manage, but our lap times stayed very consistent which again was a positive. Going into race two it was time we made the choice to go with the softer tyre which gives us a great performance. I was very interested to see where we would have been after nine or ten laps because in the sprint race we were keeping very consistent and other riders started to drop. So, for me I was very optimistic but unfortunately, we had a technical issue when we left the grid. I came in to see if it could be fixed but we missed the start which was disappointing. It was frustrating because looking at the lap times in the race they were not running a massively fast pace and the guys I’ve been battling with ended up fourth in that race so, we had a possible good result. These things happen in racing. The main thing is we will learn from this and try at the next one.” \n"}

Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) took the first DTM win of his career and the first DTM victory for a South African in Sunday’s race at Assen (NED). The BMW Team RBM driver made perfect use of the rain and the difficult track conditions and, thanks to a flawless drive and a perfect team strategy, moved up from 14th on the grid to P1. Timo Glock (GER, iQOO BMW M4 DTM), Marco Wittmann (GER, Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM), Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM) and Lucas Auer (AUT, BMW Bank M4 DTM) also did well in the conditions and finished in the top ten. After a dry qualifying session, heavy rain set in shortly before the race got underway. The rain eased off gradually in the first half of the race and Glock in particular set off on an extraordinary race to gain positions with strong overtaking manoeuvres in that initial stage which saw him move up into second place. Van der Linde made his compulsory pit stop early and afterwards had a clear run which saw him move up into the lead after his rivals made later pit stops. An accident and heavy rain setting in again interrupted the race temporarily. On the restart, van der Linde held on to his top-spot commandingly and brought the win home. Jonathan Aberdein (RSA, CATL BMW M4 DTM) was the highest qualifying BMW driver in sixth, but was unable to keep up with the pace at the front in the rain and ended up finishing in 13th place. The fifth race weekend of the DTM season is this coming weekend, at the Nürburgring (GER). Reactions to the eighth DTM race of the 2020 season in Assen. Rudolf Dittrich (General Manager BMW Motorsport Vehicle Development):“What a fantastic win for Sheldon van der Linde! Congratulations to him and BMW Team RBM on a brilliant performance in these difficult conditions. The early pit stop combined with Sheldon’s flawless drive paid off perfectly. He had a free run so was able to make up a lot of time and positions. He also mastered the restart extremely well as the leader and more than deserved the first victory in his DTM career. Timo Glock also had a fantastic race. Watching him as he ploughed through the field in the rain was a real pleasure. Generally, our cars, teams and drivers did well in today’s conditions and made use of them almost flawlessly. All in all, it was great to drive in front of fans again at Assen, with whom we will celebrate this win briefly before heading straight on to next weekend.” Bart Mampaey (Team Principal BMW Team RBM):“First, I’d like to thank the whole team for their hard work. We were close at the Lausitzring and now it really was enough for the very top. We opted for an alternative strategy, but with something in mind. We expected the whole race to be wet. Then it dried up during the race, but we saw that the bad weather would make a comeback. We were way down the grid with two of our cars. They had the pace but couldn’t move up the field. Then, after his early tyre change, Sheldon van der Linde drove fast laps and overtook the others who didn’t react to our strategy. Then the rain came back, and it was very tense again at the restart. I think we did a really good job. The stops were good, the tyre pressure too, and Sheldon was fantastic. I’m really pleased.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 11th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 9th, 44 points):“The conditions today were difficult. We had to fight a bit in the first stint, the second was much better. Then the safety car was deployed and we ended up in eighth place. Obviously, that isn’t quite what we had hoped for, since we thought we might have moved further up the field in the changeable conditions, but ultimately I was lacking a little pace and performance this weekend. Now we need to make sure we do better at the Nürburgring next week. Congratulations to Sheldon on his first win. Everything went well for him today. He had great pace in the second stint and definitely deserved to win.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 8th, Race: 6th, Driver’s standings: 5th, 62 points):“Things went really well in the rain. I had a good feeling for the car and only had to wait a little bit for the tyres to get to the right temperature. Then I was able to race at a really good speed and move up into second place. Up until the red flag I was really happy. I didn’t really know what was going on around me and who had already pitted. Perhaps we can discuss whether we should have stopped at a different point but we didn’t really know what the weather was going to do so I understand why we split the strategy. At the restart I had the problem that there was too much water on the track and I had too much spray. I lost a few places in that phase. Congratulations to Sheldon. I’m really happy that we were able to bring home the win for BMW.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 16th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 36 points):“Qualifying wasn’t ideal. The changes that we made between yesterday and today didn’t pay off. We need to look at that in more detail but it’s definitely not bad to come away with another point. We need to look at what we could have done better. It was a difficult race overall, and we can be really pleased with the result.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 13th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 22 points):“First of all, it was so much fun being in the car on the track in these conditions. We were a little bit unlucky because we stopped relatively late. It was an alternative strategy because we thought it might have dried up even more. Then things would have been very different. Then the rain came on again, which didn’t help us. Despite that, I’m really happy for Sheldon, for BMW Team RBM and for BMW. It was an important win today.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 6th, Race: 13th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 19 points):“We had a good starting position with sixth on the grid. It was very clear that I didn’t have the pace in the first stint. I’m not sure why that was. Then there was the red flag and I wasn’t really able to make up any ground after that. It was a tough race overall. But I’m over the moon for my fellow South African Sheldon, who celebrated his first DTM victory today.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 14th, Race: 1st, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 60 points):“It’s incredible. We started from 14th on the grid and moved up into P1. To be honest, a dream came true today. We never would have expected it at the start. This shows that anything really can happen. The weather was really strange the whole weekend. We were able to get the maximum out of the race and my team had a fantastic strategy today. The car was amazing in the wet. I’m just really happy to have got my first DTM win. I think everyone at BMW more than deserves this. My team worked so hard for this. Thanks to everyone for this.”\n"}

Team-mate Eugene Laverty (IRL) sparkled in the first race with a strong recovery to move up into eighth place, claiming his best race result so far with BMW. Sykes also crossed the finish line in the top ten, in tenth place. The racetrack near Alcañiz is hosting the WorldSBK for the second time in the space of just a few days with the fifth round of the 2020 season being held there this weekend. In Superpole on Saturday morning Sykes set the fourth-fastest time, which saw him qualifying for the second row of the grid. Laverty finished qualifying in 16th place. In the race on Saturday afternoon, initially Sykes held his ground in the top five, but lost positions as the race went on, finishing in tenth. Meanwhile, Laverty set off on his journey up the field from 16th on the grid. On lap 14 of 20 he had reached the top ten, then on lap 16 he moved up into eighth place where he remained to the finish line. Quotes after race one at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “I’m happy with both riders finishing in the top ten. Congratulations to Eugene, who battled his way up the field well in the race with the potential to finish in P6. It wasn’t easy to roll up the field from behind; it was a good performance, but a 24 second deficit to the winner shows that we are still a long way away from where we want to be. It was good, however, to see that Eugene has gained more confidence in his motorbike and is able to battle for positions. We hope that this positive trend continues on Sunday. Tom had a good start from fourth on the grid after a very strong lap in Superpole. Looking at the first race weekend here at Aragón, this made up a lot. However, Tom lost a few positions over the first half of the race. We knew that we wouldn’t be able to keep up with the pace of the best-placed riders on this track but our goal tomorrow is to pick up as many points as possible in Superpole and then in the race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a good Superpole from Tom, while Eugene could not make anything out of his qualifying tyre and obviously his grid position reflected that. In the race, we got away reasonably well. Tom got a good run, made a mistake and lost three places, dropped down in a group that was kind of from six to 12th. Eugene, on the other hand, made good use of his race pace and his tyre and came through the pack, while Tom went the other way. I am happy for Eugene to get a good top-ten result. Tom on the other hand did not live up really to his expectations, got dropped back and didn’t had anything to fight with. We are going to be happy with eight and tenth, going to work overnight, trying to find some mechanical grip that we can use in the race tomorrow to make up that straight-line deficit.” Eugene Laverty: “Actually, it has been our best race so far this year. Starting from 16th is still difficult but unfortunately at the moment we can’t go faster with the bike, but at least we can keep a good rhythm in the race. It’s tough from down there but I managed to come forward in the second half of the race and I used a bit of my experience to manage the bike well in the end when the tyres were slimy and the others suffered and were making mistakes while I kept smooth and came forward. It was a good race and I think we have definitely done something. For tomorrow’s Superpole race I’ve given myself a task because it’s going to be tough from P16 but I will be aiming for the top nine because that gives you a top nine grid position for race two. That is going to be my only goal for the Superpole race. And in the final race – no matter where I will be starting from – I’ve got to go forwards. We are trying to improve the bike further and to finish the weekend on a real high.” Tom Sykes: “It’s a shame today as we are still riding around some limitations. In Superpole, it’s very easy to manage the BMW S 1000 RR, I feel very relaxed on the bike and where I need to be. In the races we certainly have some strong points, but we are still missing out quite big in some areas so that is difficult. For the race we had a good start, but ran into trouble with braking as I was overriding the bike, which ultimately had a knock-on effect in the remaining 12 laps. It’s tricky but we are always learning. I’d rather have a difficult year this year, build up the knowledge and come back next year stronger, but for now it’s hard to take. On paper and the way things feel, I know I am so much better than this. For sure, like I said, there are some really strong points on the package, just at the moment we are not able to see the full potential of the BMW S 1000 RR. There is good spirit from the boys, the whole of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team are trying new things and working hard so we will come back tomorrow and give it our all.”\n"}

At the opener of the fourth race weekend of the DTM season, Jonathan Aberdein (RSA) in the CATL BMW M4 DTM finished in sixth place as the best BMW driver.  ->","completion":" Assen. The BMW DTM drivers experienced a difficult sporting Saturday at Assen (NED). At the opener of the fourth race weekend of the DTM season, Jonathan Aberdein (RSA) in the CATL BMW M4 DTM finished in sixth place as the best BMW driver. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) and Timo Glock (GER, iQOO BMW M4 DTM) also picked up points for finishing seventh and ninth in a race that was all about tyre management. Robert Kubica (POL) crossed the finish line in tenth place for the privateer BMW customer team ART Grand Prix to secure the first top-ten result of his DTM career. Lucas Auer (AUT, BMW Bank M4 DTM), who won Sunday’s race at the Lausitzring (GER), narrowly missed out on the points in eleventh place. Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM) in 13th finished ahead of Marco Wittmann (GER, Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM). His hopes of a good result came to nothing early on when the rear of his car was hit by a rival, causing him to spin. After three race weekends without spectators, fans were allowed back into the stands for the first time this season at Assen, creating something of the usual DTM atmosphere. Reactions to the seventh DTM race of the 2020 season in Assen. Rudolf Dittrich (General Manager BMW Motorsport Vehicle Development):“First off, it was fantastic to finally contest a race weekend together with the DTM fans. They are the heart and soul of the DTM which is why we are pleased that a little bit of normality returned here at Assen. Unfortunately, we were unable to build on our sporting performance from the Lausitzring. Even in qualifying we didn’t have the pace we expected. Then, in the race we were very careful with the tyres to start with after the experiences in the free practice sessions. Now we need to analyse whether we might have been too cautious. Unfortunately, unlike in the course of the season so far, we were unable to make considerable progress in the race. Looking ahead to tomorrow, we need to make sure that we are better in qualifying. Congratulations to Robert Kubica on his first top-ten result and to Robin Frijns on his win.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 10th, Race: 14th, Drivers’ standings: 8th, 40 points):“After spinning in the opening phase my race was over. My rear wing was damaged, and it was more like I was rolling around the track. It was very disappointing but in general there wasn’t a lot here for BMW today. Now we need to see what we can do better for tomorrow.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 14th, Race: 9th, Driver’s standings: 5th, 54 points):“When you start from that far down the grid it’s difficult to move up at all. The start was really, really good, then we had a duel in turn five, which damaged my car. My splitter at the front was damaged. I had a relatively large amount of understeer in the car. Initially, I was only driving behind, and in the second stint I noticed that the damage at the front was affecting the balance slightly. I tried to keep a bit of distance, protect my tyres and hope that with the high tyre wear that everyone would be having issues by the end. That happened to a few drivers, including some BMW colleagues so at least I was able to come away with two points, but it is disappointing to cross the finish line 30 seconds behind.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 7th, Race: 11th, Drivers’ standings: 9th, 35 points):“That was a hard day overall. Things went well in qualifying, but the race was unfortunately a non-event. Maybe we should have been less strict with the tyre management within BMW. It’s definitely a lesson for the race tomorrow.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 8th, Race: 13th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 20 points):“Qualifying was really good, and so were the start and the first stint. I feel that we stopped too early. In the second stint I had extreme blistering on the tyres from one lap to the next and just slipped down.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 9th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 19 points):“In sixth place I was the best BMW driver, and it was my best result of the year, but we can’t really be pleased with the result, particularly with our deficit to Audi. We need to put our heads together and work hard on closing the gap.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 11th, Race: 7th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 35 points):“It looked like a tyre management race. Patience really was the order of the day at the start. It was about protecting the tyres because I knew that we would get going towards the end. I was in P13 and P14 at the start. I made up a lot of places at the end and moved up into P7.”\n"}

The BMW M4 GT4 livery contest has a winner. Chan Wen Bin (MYS) fought off numerous competitors with his proposed design for the BMW M4 GT4 and can now look forward to a cash prize of 3,000 US dollars and his design being used on a real racing car. The 27-year-old graphic designer from Semenyih (MYS) not only won over the top-class jury comprising multimedia artist and BMW Art Car designer Cao Fei, Michael Scully (Global Automotive Director @Designworks) and BMW works driver Bruno Spengler (CAN), BMW Motorsport fans also had the chance to vote for their favourites on social media and influence the result. At the season finale of the DTM Trophy at Hockenheim (GER) on 7th\/8th November, the winning design will be on show in a real-world race. A BMW M4 GT4 will compete there in the look created by Wen Bin. The design will also be available soon on the iRacing sim racing platform. The BMW M4 GT4 has been racing on that platform in the virtual world since June, where it enjoys great popularity. “I’ve been a fan of BMW since my childhood and always dreamed of achieving something with BMW one day,” said Wen Bin. “This livery contest was a fantastic opportunity for me to show my passion for BMW and have my design used by BMW Motorsport. I’m over the moon and am delighted to have won this competition. I can’t wait to see the result in the real world. It’s one of my biggest successes in my career as a designer. Thank you so much BMW.” In addition to the pure aesthetic perspective, the jury also placed a great deal of importance on the link between virtual and real-world motorsport when making their decision. With the motto ‘THE FUSION OF REAL WORLD AND SIM RACING’, the entrants were faced with the task of creating a design whose elegance and beauty comes into full effect not only in the virtual world but also in the real world. “The black overall colour is always classic and elegant for a high-performance BMW coupe,” said Cao Fei, who designed the 18th BMW Art Car – a BMW M6 GT3, in which BMW works driver Augusto Farfus (BRA) competed at the FIA GT World Cup in Macau (CHN) in 2017. “The subtle blue and red parts scattered around the car is not only lively and chic, accentuating its sporty and exclusive aesthetics, but the colour combination also reflects the very essence of BMW M series, paying tribute to its history and legacy. This livery is truly timeless.” With his design, Wen Bin prevailed over numerous competitors who had the opportunity to send in their proposals since the design competition opened on 8th July 2020. In addition to the jury’s verdict, the votes from the BMW Motorsport community on social media also played a part in the decision. After Wen Bin, Juan Diego Sánchez (ESP) and Monholo Oumar (FRA) finished in second and third place with their suggestions. They look forward to a cash prize of 2,000 US dollars and 1,000 US dollars respectively. Rudolf Dittrich, head of BMW Motorsport vehicle development and initiator of the competition, said “Congratulations to Chan Wen Bin on winning the BMW M4 GT4 design competition. With his design he has perfectly expressed the fusion of real-world and virtual motorsport. I’m already looking forward to the season finale of the DTM Trophy at Hockenheim, when the livery will cause a real stir in a real-world race and will be just as much of a delight to see. But I’m equally looking forward to seeing the design in use in the virtual world. Many thanks to all the creative minds who took part in this competition. The range of submissions surprised us in part, inspired us and boosted our motivation to shape sim racing and real-world motorsport along with this fantastic community.”\n"}

{"prompt":"Leisure sport and sustainable energy generation morph into one along the Verdon River bordering the south-eastern edge of Provence. This is an ideal destination for a white-water rafting outing with the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4. It can transport kayaks to remote boating points along the river while at the same time embracing the opportunity to use electricity from renewable sources to power driving fun. ->","completion":" Munich. This gorge is one of the most spectacular natural landscapes between Brittany and the Côte d’Azur. Water-sports enthusiasts, hikers, and climbers call it “France’s Grand Canyon”: the Verdon Gorge located in the south east of the Département Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. Over a period of millions of years, the Verdon River has cut its way through the region’s limestone. The gorge is more than 20 kilometres long, with winding country roads wending their way through little villages and past popular panoramic viewing points. In summer, hosts of tourists with canoes and kayaks are on the lookout for somewhere to launch their boats and paddle along the turquoise-blue waters of the Verdon. The MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 proves to be an ideal vehicle for negotiating the dirt and gravel tracks leading to the banks of the river. After all, it has a hybrid-specific all-wheel drive that additionally creates a particularly sustainable form of driving fun.The plug-in hybrid system of the robust all-rounder comprises a three-cylinder petrol engine equipped with MINI TwinPower turbo technology. This transmits its power to the front wheels while an electric motor is driving the rear wheels. Together, they generate a system output of 162 kW\/220 hp. Furthermore, the intelligently controlled interaction between petrol engine and electric motor ensure demand-based power distribution to suit any driving situation. The high-voltage battery is located in a low-slung position beneath the rear seat bench of the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4. This also provides a baggage compartment in the plug-in hybrid version of the versatile five-door car with a volume of between 405 and 1275 litres – ample space for holiday baggage and sports equipment. Two white-water kayaks can easily be transported to the Verdon Gorge on the roof of the biggest model of the British premium brand with the assistance of the optional roof rails and the rack system available in the MINI original accessories range.Rafting fans will find perfect conditions for ambitious white-water paddling in the swirling waters of the river between Castellane and the artificial lake of Sainte-Croix. The level of difficulty depends significantly on the flow rate of the river, which is regulated by the upstream barrages. During the holiday season, the flow is increased twice a week. On these days, seasoned kayakers can ride the foaming rapids of the Verdon surging through the gorge towering up to 700 metres above.A total of five barrages were erected between the 1920s and the 1970s in order to harness the waters of the Verdon River, supply the surrounding regions with water and generate energy with the assistance of hydropower stations. The latest and simultaneously biggest of the reservoirs created in this way is the Lac de Sainte-Croix, which has developed into a popular getaway destination. The high fluorine content colours the waters turquoise blue and in summertime they warm up to reach pleasurable bathing temperatures. Water-sports fans who prefer a more leisurely approach are able to take a trip upstream from the lake into the Verdon Gorge and admire the steep, rocky walls soaring above from the vantage point of canoes and pedalos.Around 140 million kilowatt hours of electricity are generated each year by the hydropower station of the Lac de Sainte-Croix, which is located behind a concrete dam 95 metres high. The sustainably produced energy is fed into the distribution grid of the surrounding region. This means that the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 is able to recharge its lithium-ion battery with electricity generated from renewable sources during its evening stopover in Sainte Croix du Verdon. The high-voltage battery with gross energy capacity of 10.0 kWh can be plugged into a standard domestic power socket and fully charged in less than three and a quarter hours.The locally replenished energy reserves powered by nature make the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 ready for zero-emission mobility on trips into the countryside around Lac de Sainte-Croix. Pressing the eDrive toggle switch suffices to switch the drive system to all-electric driving fun. In the MAX eDrive operating mode, the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 can then reach a top speed of 135 km\/h powered solely by its electric motor. The storage capacity of its high-voltage battery gives the car a range of 55 to 61 kilometres on a leisurely drive through the picturesque landscape of southern Provence.Short trips to places like the historic mountain village Moustiers-Sainte-Marie, the Renaissance castle in Aiguines or the lavender fields in the northern part of the Verdon nature reserve can be undertaken without any CO2 emissions whatsoever. The supply of electricity is even sufficient for a trip right round the man-made lake. And if the stunning landscape entices the occupants to take a spontaneous diversion, the internal combustion engine automatically springs into action. \n"}

Daniel Barenboim was appointed general music director of the Staatskapelle in 1992.Staatsoper Unter den Linden and BMW are delighted that Anne-Sophie Mutter agreed to perform as solo artist at “State Opera for All”. The pianist Lang Lang had very much been looking forward to celebrate Beethoven’s 250. anniversary together with Daniel Barenboim, Staatskapelle Berlin and the German audience. However, as a result of rising numbers in infections linked to the coronavirus across the world international travel bears significant health risks. For this reason, Lang Lang decided with a heavy heart to cancel his Berlin performance. He wishes all participants and spectators a wonderful concert and hopes to be able to perform in Germany again very soon.The concert will be recorded by the German TV channel ZDF and aired on September 13, 2020 at 10.15 pm.

As we are marking the 450 year-long history of Staatskapelle Berlin, we are also celebrating the concert as a symbol of a new beginning in the wake of a culture of silence imposed by the coronavirus. This year, we saw the season interrupted in a way we have witnessed never before in the long history of Staatsoper Unter den Linden and its orchestra. Together with BMW, we would like to use ‘State Opera for All’ and this live event to give back and to thank all those that dutifully served our society over the previous months. In a crisis, we learn how important solid partnerships are and appreciate the trust placed in the power of culture, which is also why I would like to use this occasion to thank BMW as our main partner for our close collaboration of many years.” “I am delighted and honoured to conduct the concert as part of ‘State Opera for All’ on the occasion of the 450. anniversary of Staatskapelle Berlin and to once again perform at Bebelplatz.

{"prompt":"The MINI John Cooper Works is the epitome of extreme driving fun in the premium segment of small cars. The search for its sporting DNA takes us to the scene of the greatest triumph for the classic Mini and on a journey through time back to the golden years of the Monte Carlo Rally. ->","completion":" Munich. Formula 1 on the North Loop of the Nürburgring, the 24 Hour Race of Le Mans, the 500 Miles of Indianapolis or the Monte Carlo Rally. Each motor-sport discipline has its iconic venue. Anyone who has achieved victory there is assured of a fixed place in the annals of history for that particular competition. Drivers who were victorious there not once but three times attain legendary status in the hall of fame. The classic Mini conquered the hearts of motor-sport fans during the special tests in Provence, on the winding roads and hairpin bends of the Col de Turini and on the grand prix circuit through the city streets of Monaco. In each of the years 1964, 1965 and 1967, the pint-sized British car earned overall victory in the Monte Carlo Rally. Since then, this classic rally has been inseparably linked up with the heritage brand and the name John Cooper. On a trip down memory lane with the legitimate successor to the surprise winner in the 1960s, the MINI John Cooper Works , this intimate relationship is tangible over every kilometre.A 170 kW\/231 hp four-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology, a sports exhaust system and a model-based chassis with sports braking system and 17-inch John Cooper Works lightweight alloy wheels transform the MINI John Cooper Works into the apotheosis of extreme driving fun in the premium segment of small cars. The sprint from a standing start to a speed of 100 km\/h takes the little runabout just 6.3 seconds. In the intermediate sprint from 80 to 120 km\/h, a time of just 5.6 seconds even leaves blue-riband sports cars behind.This connects it with the classic Mini driven by Paddy Hopkirk to outstanding successes, always achieved against much bigger and more powerful opponents. This was an era when vehicles from different classes competed against each other in the Monte Carlo Rally. A handicap formula was used to provide appropriate compensation when allocating points to balance out the differences in weight, displacement and performance. This enabled the agility and reliability of the classic Mini combined with the rally skills of its drivers to tip the scales in the battle against the powerful and muscular projectiles of other manufacturers.Today, anyone setting a course for Monaco over the pass roads through the mountains of Southern France is following in the tracks of yesteryear’s rally legends. Even driving under summer conditions, by day and in the modern MINI John Cooper Works fitted with particularly powerful brakes, multifaceted driving stability systems and automatic air-conditioning, we can gain a good impression of the challenges to be mastered by the competitors, for example in the legendary “Night of the Long Knives” more than 50 years ago. The steep roads leading up to the Col de Turini pass, the icy road surfaces and pitch-black darkness provided a scenario that demanded a huge amount of courage and skill from the drivers.Spectacular landscapes dominate the picture in the French Maritime Alps. However, the perspective soon changes and the street canyons, waterside promenades and Port of Monaco come into view for the first time. The road runs in parallel with the coastline along the Avenue Agerbol and the Route de la Moyenne Corniche offering lots of opportunities to stop and enjoy the breath-taking panoramic view over the principality beside the sea.In the south of Monaco between the Port de Fontvieille and the football stadium of AS Monaco, the MINI John Cooper Works goes past the Roseraie Princesse Grace, a rose garden laid out to celebrate the memory of Princess Gracia Patricia. From there, it’s not far to the princely residence and the city centre of Monte Carlo. In the yachting marina and on the lookout for a parking space in front of Monte Carlo’s casino, the MINI John Cooper Works bustles along with a self-assuredness similar to the headstrong classic Mini of an earlier era on the authentic rally route through the phalanx of luxury saloons and super sports cars from Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom that dominate the roads of Monaco. The car signals sophisticated understatement with its standard John Cooper Works Aerodynamic Kit and the striking rear spoiler, and highlights the certainty of generating maximum driving fun on a minimalist footprint.Nowhere more intensely than in Monte Carlo does the MINI John Cooper Works demonstrate that genuine race feeling can also be experienced in urban everyday traffic. After all, this is a place where you can go on a city tour as you drive along a genuine grand prix circuit. But you need to make sure that you go around clockwise just like on race weekends. Ready, steady, go and off into the famous Sainte-Dévote right-hand corner and then uphill in the direction of the casino. Driving along the street circuit, you can see the trail of bronze statues depicting famous racing cars and their drivers. The MINI John Cooper Works is really in its element once it gets to the hairpin bend that has caused problems for genuine Formula 1 rockets for decades. Shortly afterwards, it shoots through the tunnel under the Fairmont Hotel with pizzazz, round the Piscine corner circumventing the swimming pool and then the equally famous Rascasse corner in front of the eponymous restaurant. The diminutive elite athlete fitted with a cockpit styled specifically for the model and the John Cooper Works sports seats transforms this drive into a unique experience constituting a perfectly melded union of motor-sport tradition and modern driving fun – even while still keeping to the speed limit. \n"}

The 70 best pros in the FedExCup ranking went head to head at the penultimate Playoff tournament on the PGA TOUR. The North Course at the Olympia Fields Country Club (Chicago, USA) required the pros to make the most of all their skills. When it came to the crunch, Jon Rahm (-4) produced an impressive performance on Sunday to record the best round of the entire week. The 2018 Ryder Cup winner rounded off his outstanding performance by sinking a 20-metre putt in a playoff to secure his fifth win on the PGA TOUR.After the first round, which the 25-year-old Spaniard ended on 5 over par, there was no sign of him heading for his fifth PGA TOUR win. However, Rahm gradually worked his way back up the leaderboard and produced a final-day performance that was more than worthy of a Playoff tournament winner. Rahm not only recorded the best round of the week as he carded 6 under par, but followed that by conjuring up a birdie putt across the width of the 18th green in his playoff against world no. 1 Dustin Johnson to lay claim to the prestigious title. The playoff between the two best players in the world rankings was the most spectacular way to round off the BMW Championship.“Congratulations to Jon Rahm on capturing the BMW Championship,” said Bernhard Kuhnt, president and CEO, BMW of North America. “On behalf of everyone at BMW, I’d like to thank the Western Golf Association, the PGA TOUR and the volunteers who helped out this week. A special thank you also to the great grounds crew at Olympia Fields who kept the course in exceptional condition, and to the members of the club for their continuing support of the Evans Scholars Foundation. The BMW Championship is so important because of what it gives back to so many young caddies, so we’re especially happy to host the event during this unique time.”BMW Championship winner from 2010 and 2016 Johnson has his own outstanding putt to thank for forcing a playoff contest. Trailing by one stroke as he approached the 72nd hole, the 36-year-old had to sink a putt from nearly 14 metres to claim the birdie he required. It is rare indeed to see two such outstanding putts under intense pressure in such a short space of time as during those decisive minutes at the BMW Championship 2020.Behind Rahm and Johnson, Joaquin Niemann from Chile and Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama (both -2) shared third place. Tony Finau (USA, -1) finished fifth. Rory McIlroy (NIR, +3), winner of the BMW Championship 2012, was in the lead after two rounds, but dropped down into tied twelfth place at the weekend. This week, the overall winner of the FedExCup will be revealed at the TOUR Championship at the East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta. Johnson leads the FedExCup standings, Rahm and Justin Thomas (USA) are in second and third.The BMW Championship 2021 will take place in the greater Baltimore area. The tournament will be held from 23rd to 29th August at the Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mills.\n"}

Three weekends, three events – that is what the BMW DTM teams can look forward to over the coming weeks. A triple-header – rounds four to six of the season – awaits them within the compact 2020 DTM schedule. First up for the BMW M4 DTM is Assen (NED), from 4th to 6th September. That is followed by two events at the Nürburgring (GER \/ 11th to 13th September and 18th to 20th September). The legendary “TT Circuit” in Assen hosted the DTM for the first time last year, with BMW DTM driver Marco Wittmann (GER) catching the eye. He took pole position and the race win on the Saturday, before producing an impressive fightback from the back of the grid to finish runner-up and claim a spot on the podium on the Sunday. The lap record for the 4.555-kilometre track is held by BMW DTM driver Philipp Eng (AUT), with a time of 1:27.860 minutes. In Assen, fans will have their first opportunity to watch the races live from the grandstands with 10,000 spectators being permitted at the circuit on each race day. Following the races in Assen, the BMW DTM teams travel straight to the Nürburgring where, as at the Lausitzring (GER) earlier in the season, they will race on two different layouts. Round five of the 2020 DTM season will be held on the 5.148-kilometre Grand Prix Circuit, with round six taking place one week later on the shorter 3.629-kilometre layout. Four of the BMW DTM drivers are immediately back in action after the DTM triple-header: The following week, Wittmann, Eng, Lucas Auer (AUT) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) will drive in the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife :“I think we had two very positive weekends at Lausitzring including my first DTM podium. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to translate our strong performance into results on the second weekend but that does not change my motivation. Now I am fully ready for Assen which is one of my favourite circuits on the calendar along with Spa. From a driving point of view I can’t wait to be back and I can’t wait to have the fans back as well. This is going to be super special and I think this will make us realize how much we missed them and how much they have a role to play in our success. I hope that I will be able to share a few podiums with them, that will be the goal for us. I am looking forward to getting more points, the car is competitive now and we are making progress. I hope that we can keep doing that and race to the podium.” \n"}

After a disappointing Saturday at MotorLand Aragón (ESP), BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team worked hard overnight which saw them make some improvements. Despite the difficult starting position in Sunday’s race, this progress enabled them to finish in the points. Tom Sykes (GBR) crossed the finish line in 12th, his team-mate Eugene Laverty (IRL) finished in 14th. Sykes and Laverty started the Superpole Race on Sunday morning from 14th and 18th on the grid. Sykes moved up into 11th place right at the start but was pushed aside in the turmoil entering Turn 8 and was forced to swerve through the gravel. Unfortunately, he collided with Leandro Mercado (ARG) as he returned to the track, who fell and unfortunately injured himself. Sykes finished the Superpole Race in 15th place, with Laverty right behind him in 16th. In the second main race on Sunday afternoon, the two riders finished in the points after starting near the back of the grid, Sykes in P12 and Laverty in P14. This coming weekend sees BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team in action again at the same track, with part two of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) double header at MotorLand Aragón. Quotes after race two at MotorLand Aragón. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “After yesterday’s disappointments the guys worked really hard overnight and I have to thank the whole team for that. The guys went out this morning in warm up and put in a solid session. The Superpole Race was always going to be a problem from that far back, we have not got a lot to fight with on the long straights as we know, and that carried into the race. I think Eugene did well to consolidate some results as his confidence was low after the issue yesterday, so I have to applaud him for his efforts. He buckled down and he can sleep on that and come back stronger next week. With Tom starting from so far back he was getting mixed up with guys that are stronger in other areas than him. I think when Tom had the clear track, and a gap, he could reel off those low 1’51 lap times. As soon as he got in the company of everyone else, he was in a battle with nothing to fight with so it was quite predictable where he would end up. He could maybe have squeezed into the top 10 but we just wanted to consolidate these results and concentrate on the race here next week.” Tom Sykes: “It was a shame in the Superpole Race. Chaz Davies made a miscalculation in one corner which pushed me out wide and left me nowhere to go. This is a shame as Tati Mercado got injured in the aftermath which is something you never want to see. Race two was frustrating, we had certainly had the pace to get away from the guys, but we had those limitations on the straights which undid all the hard work we did in the corners catching them up.” Eugene Laverty: “The weekend as a whole has been so tough, which I didn’t see coming. Starting down the grid made it difficult, but we just didn’t have the pace. However, finally today we found what we needed so we were able to make progress with the bike in the final race two. So that at least gives us some direction for next week in Aragón, but we have lost an entire weekend.” \n"}

The “24 Heures Motos” in Le Mans (FRA) came to a dramatic, unfortunate end for BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. After almost 24 hours of racing, the #37 BMW S 1000 RR retired 12 minutes before the finish. The trio of Kenny Foray (FRA), Markus Reiterberger (GER) and Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) were in fifth place at the time. The 2019\/20 season marks the debut season of the team in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC). Traditionally, the endurance classic in Le Mans is held in April, but this year it was postponed until the end of August due to the coronavirus. The weather, however, was very much like the typical weather in April. There were intermittent rain showers and the 24 hours were characterised by changeable conditions and falls, with the safety car having to be deployed several times. BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team started the racing marathon from second on the grid. The #37 BMW S 1000 RR took the lead in the opening phase. The first rain started after two hours, and made the surface very slippery. Foray’s rear wheel skidded and he fell in the gravel, but was able to continue the race. The team was now in fourth place, the #37 remaining in this position until the early hours before dropping down a place into fifth. It rained again in the final minutes of the race, and Mikhalchik fell shortly before the finish line. He was taken to the medical centre for treatment, but suffered only minor injuries. GERT56 by GS YUASA had reason to celebrate: The privateer BMW team celebrated victory in the Superstock class , will be held on Saturday 26th September. Quotes from the “24 Heures Motos” in Le Mans. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It’s a real shame that our Le Mans debut ended so dramatically. Overall, it was great that a race was finally able to be held for the scheduled duration but the weather made it a very difficult, chaotic race, and it wasn’t possible to make any strategic plans for much of the race. On top of that, compared with the Bol d’Or we were unlucky in terms of the timing of the rain and safety car phases. But it was the first test of endurance for the BMW S 1000 RR in the FIM EWC, and we came through pretty well until shortly before the end, despite Kenny’s minor fall after two hours. We were able to see that with regard to consumption we are the best in the field, and we were up there at the front in the pit stops as well. The only thing we are lacking is a bit of pace in certain conditions. Which is why we are so disappointed that our race came to an end so close to the finish when Ilya fell in the drizzle. But we win together and lose together. The most important thing is that Ilya wasn’t hurt more seriously. A huge thanks goes to the whole team and the riders for their hard work before and during the race. Now we will rally ourselves, leave the disappointment behind us and focus all our attention on preparing for Estoril. We want to finish our rookie season with a strong result there.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:“I feel very disappointed, not only for me but for the whole team and all those who were working hard for a good result. In the first two races we saw that we are podium candidates in this championship and I think that this weekend we showed once again that we can fight for the podium and that we are able to fight for victory – if everything goes right. But this weekend, Lady Luck was not on our side, but that is also racing. Now we will take the positives, go forward and prepare hard for Estoril.” Kenny Foray: “It was a good race, even if the result for sure is not what we expected because it is always difficult to finish like this. But I think that we need to look at the positives. The bike was incredible over the entire race distance, the pace of the riders was as well. For sure we need to improve in some areas, but I am pretty sure that this is possible because I believe in the team. And I think that we will have more luck in the next race.” Markus Reiterberger: “First of all, huge thanks to the whole team, who worked so hard after the very good test and made further improvements to everything for the event. And to the organisers who made it possible for the race to take place. In the race, Kenny’s fall in heavy rain saw us drop down the field slightly, but all of us then did a good job, focussed during our stints and I was able to get a few very fast lap times during the night. We gave it everything, but it was difficult to catch the guys in front of us again. Which is why we would have been very pleased with fifth place in the end. The familiar pitfalls of endurance races made their appearance over these 24 hours: freak weather, crashes, safety car phases. It really was a very, very difficult and long race. Unfortunately, we didn’t receive our reward in the end. It’s a real shame for the whole team who worked so hard. But we need to keep looking forward. We have seen what we are capable of and we will build on that.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “It was my mistake. I was too fast in my stint. The other guys slowed down but I kept going at my pace, made a small mistake, went too wide and there was a bump and I just lost the front. We were in P5 and I tried to give my best, as always. I want to say a big, big sorry to BMW and to my team who did a fantastic job over the entire weekend. The bike was really great and fast over the whole 24 hours and would even have been able to win the race. But the tricky weather conditions did not give us this chance. Sorry again to the whole team, to all the fans and everyone who supports us. Let’s not repeat this bad experience in the future.” \n"}

For me personally, the feeling got better session after session and I feel good on the bike even if I wasn’t able to go my pace so far. But I am convinced that it will be okay during the race. We have all the ingredients for a really good race. We riders are all fast and the team is strong so I expect the best. But 24 hours are 24 hours and I think that the weather will not be the best as we expect some rain, but we will see. I am sure that we can achieve a really, really good result.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “Overall, we have a strong package. All riders set fast lap times and have a strong pace and this is important in an endurance race. The bike also is really consistent and overall easy to ride, which is also good. So I am definitely looking forward to this long race. We will rest this night to be ready and fit tomorrow and then we try to enjoy these 24 hours of racing.” Markus Reiterberger: “We were a bit unlucky with the weather yesterday, but we were able to recover well in the better conditions today. Kenny improved his lap time, Ilya unfortunately crashed, and I had to switch to the reserve bike – but we still managed to set the fastest time of the day. Qualifying was suspended after that, because another rider crashed. Maybe I could have gone even faster, as I felt great on the bike. Whatever, we have a good starting position for the race. The pace is there and everyone is doing a superb job. We must now ensure that we get off to a good start, avoid any crashes or mistakes, and get through the 24 hours without any technical issues.” Peter Hickman: “It is great to be with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. The bike itself was new for me but it has been good and I really enjoyed it. I am happy. I am here as the reserve rider and it was about to get to know the bike as much as possible in case I am needed. The team is really strong and the three regular riders all set real strong lap times and all are comfortable on the bike. The team is strong for the race, all have a good pace. Who knows what happens when we get going but fingers crossed for tomorrow and Sunday.” \n"}

Under this year’s title “The Crack Begins Within” the 11th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art presents its final chapter from September 5 to November 1, 2020: an epilogue conceived to merge the activities from the past months. Since its inception in 1998, the Biennale has become one of the most important events of contemporary art worldwide and shows the latest relevant and challenging positions independent of the art market’s and collection’s interests. The BMW Group is long-term corporate partner of the Berlin Biennale.Since September 2019 and as a process over one year, the 11th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art has been unfolding in three different experiences – exp. 1, exp. 2 and exp. 3. With presentations, performances, workshops, and artist residencies they articulated diverse modes of solidarity, fragility and resistance. During the fourth and last part conceived as an epilogue, the curators María Berríos, Renata Cervetto, Lisette Lagnado and Agustín Pérez Rubio will bring these experiences and the issues they raise together in four locations. Due to Covid-19, the opening of the epilogue of the 11th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art has been postponed from June to September 2020.“The slow opening of the 11th Berlin Biennale began a year ago, and since then it has been exploring the many cracks we carry, the fissures that keep us apart and those that bring us together. Many of the invited artists and participants in the Biennale have been exploring and practicing this, each in their own artistic terms, in their own contexts and temporalities,” say the curators in their curatorial statement about the 11th Berlin Biennale.Furthermore, together with the Allianz Cultural Foundation, Goethe-Institut e. V. and Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen (ifa), BMW supports the Curatorial Workshop of the 11th Berlin Biennale for up-and-coming curators, educators and other practitioners (regardless of age), who are living in Berlin in the first or second generation. Under the topic “How now to gather” new protocols for gathering, for practicing solidarity and for enacting systemic change will be focused.“With the support of the 11th Berlin Biennale, we are continuing our successful partnership. This time, we are looking forward to the opportunity of exploring, debating and illustrating the diversity and dynamics of our time. The BMW Group operates in over 140 countries. For this reason, it is paramount to offer different perspectives on our multi-faceted society,” stressed Ilka Horstmeier, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Human Resources.Since its inception in 1998, the Berlin Biennale is shaped by the different concepts of curators appointed to enter into a dialogue with the city of Berlin, its public, with the people interested in arts as well as with the artists. The Berlin Biennale has become a magnet for art lovers from all over the world and is continually praised by an enthusiastic audience as an experimental context-specific exhibition.Besides the Berlin Biennale, the list of long-term commitments to the arts in Germany’s capital city includes the Gallery Weekend Berlin, the Preis der Nationalgalerie and the associated Förderpreis für Filmkunst. Beyond the extensive commitment to the arts and in the course of the digital partnership BMW OPERA NEXT, BMW cooperates with Staatsoper Unter den Linden and invites this year again to the long-standing open-air format “State Opera for All” on September 6, 2020.For further information about the 11th Berlin Biennale, please refer to: http:\/\/www.berlinbiennale.de EXHIBITION VENUES AND OPENING HOURSKW Institute for Contemporary ArtAuguststrasse 69, 10117 BerlinWed – Mon 11.00 AM – 7.00 PM, Thu 11.00 AM – 9.00 PM daadgalerie Oranienstrasse 161, 10969 BerlinWed – Mon 11.00 AM – 7.00 PM Gropius BauNiederkirchnerstrasse 7, 10963 BerlinWed – Mon 10.00 AM – 7.00 PM, Thu 10.00 AM – 9.00 PM 11th Berlin Biennale c\/o ExRotaprintBornemannstrasse 9, 13357 BerlinWed – Mon 11.00 AM – 7.00 PM All venues are closed on Tuesdays.

The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Tom Sykes (GBR) are set to continue working together in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in the 2021 season, when Sykes will line up on the BMW S 1000 RR for the third year in a row. His new team-mate will be Michael van der Mark (NED). 35-year-old Sykes has been part of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team from the word go. In the team’s debut season in 2019, he secured one pole position and four podium finishes with the BMW S 1000 RR. He has since added a further pole position at the opening round of the 2020 season on Phillip Island (AUS). “Tom has been part of our WorldSBK Team from the very start and is an important pillar of this project”, said Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director. “We are pleased to be able to continue along the common path in 2021, which we embarked upon with the first tests back in December 2018. This gives us continuity, which is very important for the successful development of a project. We have already achieved a lot together, and the goal is now to definitively close the gap to the front-runners. Tom’s extensive knowledge of the BMW S 1000 RR and his input will play a key role in achieving this.” \n"}

The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team will receive support from a big name in the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family at the “24 Heures Motos” in Le Mans (FRA).

He joins the team and its three regular riders Kenny Foray (FRA), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Markus Reiterberger (GER) at short notice. Hickman and BMW Motorrad Motorsport have enjoyed success together for many years. The 33-year-old has won four races at the Isle of Man TT on the BMW S 1000 RR and has also won the Macau Grand Prix on three occasions. Hickman has set multiple world records at the Ulster Grand Prix and is officially “The World’s Fastest Road Racer”. The Englishman has also enjoyed success on the racetrack with his regular team, Smiths Racing. In the British Superbike Championship (BSB), he has secured one of the six coveted places in the “Showdown” for the title in each of the past three years. He also rode for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team at Donington Park (GBR) in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in 2019. “We are delighted to have Peter Hickman, the best road racer – and one of the very best motorcycle racers in the world - , as the fourth rider in the team in Le Mans, joining our strong trio of regular drivers, Kenny, Ilya und Markus,” said Werner Daemen, Team Manager of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. “His success and lap records at all road races speak for themselves, as do the podiums in the British Superbike Championship. That is a very high standard, and I am confident he will be a great support for our team in Le Mans.” “I’m really excited to be part of the official BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team this weekend in Le Mans”, said Hickman. “The team is fighting for the world championship and I am privileged to have been asked to contribute to the team. I have raced at three Le Mans 24-hour races before and have also raced at Slovakia, Suzuka and Qatar. So I’m not new to endurance and have always enjoyed the experience. I can’t wait to get out on the bike!” The “24 Heures Motos” officially gets underway on Thursday 27th August with the first practice and qualifying sessions.

{"prompt":"Staycation or a holiday in a neighbouring country – this is the holiday trend for 2020. The environment is also benefiting from this – particularly if you happen to be exploring the most beautiful regions of Switzerland in the new MINI Cooper SE, which generates zero local emissions.   ->","completion":" Munich. Short awayday trips instead of travelling to far-flung places, babbling brooks and lakes rather than the sound of the sea – holidays in the summer of 2020 are very different to the vacations many people have been accustomed to in the past. This doesn’t necessarily have to be a disadvantage. The current travel restrictions are expanding our horizons for new vistas close to home. And there is undoubtedly a rich array of sights well worth seeing in a country like Switzerland, which attracts tourists from all over the world in “normal” times. And for good measure, a tour of discovery exploring nearby regions also has a significantly better environmental footprint than air travel. The outcome is particularly favourable in the new MINI Cooper SE . The car is transforming the virtually silent and zero local emission exploration of Switzerland’s mountain and lake landscape into the holiday trend of the year.In Switzerland, even residents of big cities do not have to travel very far in order to rest and relax in the midst of truly impressive natural surroundings. Outings between low-lying countryside and high mountain regions are therefore easily achievable with the MINI Cooper SE. After all, the range of this car with a fully charged battery extends to between 235 and 270 kilometres depending on the selected driving style. Schaffhausen, not far from the German border, is an ideal starting point. A message inscribed on the historic Swabian Gate exhorts people to be careful on the streets with the slogan “Lappi tue d’Augen uf” or “Fool, keep your eyes peeled”. The MINI Cooper SE signals its presence to pedestrians and cyclists in a significantly more friendly style. An artificial drive sound created especially for the MINI is transmitted to the outside world through speakers when it is driving slowly. It heralds the approach of the electric car that would otherwise be virtually silent.The neighbouring village of Neuhausen is located near the famous Rhine Fall. Visitors are taken for a close-up view of the roaring waterfalls in flat-bottomed boats where they can marvel at the power of the cascading waters. The MINI Electric uses its energy of motion for regeneration of electricity in the acceleration and deceleration phases. A toggle switch allows this recuperation to be adjusted in two stages. In power mode, the car can navigate its way through city traffic almost without touching the brake pedal. On the other hand, when coming down a mountain, the braking effect can be used to replenish the battery reserves at the same time.Conversely, reduced recuperation provides more comfort for the trip of some 50 kilometres to Zurich and also for the subsequent stages on the route to the Swiss mountains. Anybody leaving Switzerland’s biggest city across the Europe Bridge travelling in a southerly direction will soon be able to enjoy the panorama of Lake Zurich. When you are driving in GREEN mode activating an accelerator response based on efficiency, congestion and traffic lights are quickly forgotten. However, selection of the SPORT setting from the MINI Driving Modes is recommended in the Sihlwald forest nature reserve. The toggle switch activates more direct responses for steering and accelerator. The agile handling of the MINI Cooper SE is particularly effective on the winding stretch of road along the River Sihl. Alongside the electric motor generating 135 kW\/184 hp, the front-wheel drive and the chassis tuned to each specific model and actuator-operated wheel-slip limiter, the position of the high-voltage battery also contributes to the driving fun typical of the brand. The T-shaped battery is configured low down in the central tunnel and in the subfloor. This reduces the centre of gravity for the first all-electric MINI. Another effect of this location is that the storage volume of between 211 and 731 litres provides exactly the same space as the conventionally powered versions of the MINI 3-door.The roads along the banks of Lake Zug offer an opportunity for an initial break and an unrestricted view of the watery expanse on the eastern and the southerly shores. Then comes Lake Lucerne after a short sprint in a south-westerly direction. This is when the panorama is undoubtedly dominated by the undulations of the Alpine foothills. The road to Lucerne takes the MINI Cooper SE past the Swiss Transport Museum, which in itself is well worth a day’s excursion. The museum presents a collection of aircraft, railway locomotives, ships and automobiles from various eras in a number of exhibitions designed to be exciting for young visitors and adults alike. Perhaps a place will be reserved one day for the MINI Cooper SE among these milestones defining the history of mobility? After all, it is the first premium electric automobile in the small car segment.Lucerne’s biggest attraction is the Chapel Bridge on the western bank of the lake. This is a city landmark and it has the reputation of being the oldest covered wooden pedestrian bridge in Europe. The route for the onward journey then only continues in two directions: towards the south or up a mountain. Depending on the available time and the mood, the driver has a choice of two options for a substantial section of the next leg. You can travel down the motorway or take the country route alongside Lake Sarnen and a little later beside Lake Lungern.Anyone keeping an eye on the external temperature display will soon recognise what makes a trip into the mountains during the summer so relaxing: the mild climate. For every 100 metres climbed by the MINI Cooper SE into the mountains, the temperature falls by an average of half a degree centigrade. But this is no reason to switch off the air-conditioning, particularly since the standard heat-pump technology works exceptionally efficiently and therefore only uses a small amount of energy from the high-voltage battery. On the way to Interlaken, the shimmering turquoise waters of Lake Brienz present an attractive proposition for bathing in one of the four lakeside lidos. After a refreshing dip, the final spurt is a fun ride through Interlaken and up the mountain to Grindelwald.Grindelwald is a traditional tourist destination at the foot of the north face of the Eiger and home to a string of successful elite downhill skiers. This is a perfect starting point for trips to mountain peaks, grottos and glaciers. Just as it did one hundred years ago, the Jungfrau Railway passes through a tunnel seven kilometres long until it pulls into Europe’s highest railway station perched at an altitude of 3 454 metres above sea level. After arriving at the Jungfraujoch, visitors can experience a spectacular Alpine wonderland of ice, snow and rocks. A breathtaking view of the Eiger north face awaits trippers on the Grindelwald First summit. Adventurers then take the “First Flieger” cable car down for 800 metres. And the Pfingstegg summer toboggan run also races downhill to the valley. Anybody looking to explore the spectacular natural environment in peace and quiet is recommended to go on a hike through the Rosenlaui Glacier Gorge.In the meantime, the MINI Electric can be plugged into a household socket, wallbox or quick charging station and recharge its battery. The current level of charge for the high-voltage battery can easily be checked anywhere using the MINI Connected remote app. Drivers can also use the timer on their smartphone to select the desired departure time so that the stationary air-conditioning achieves a comfortable temperature inside the vehicle at the right time. This means that the MINI Cooper SE, the driver and the passengers have ideal conditions for the return trip to Zurich – or alternatively for another stage of the journey with zero local emissions through Switzerland’s most beautiful holiday regions. \n"}

The advantage of the double-header at MotorLand Aragón is that the team can remain on site for the few days between events, thus saving the time required to assemble and dismantle equipment, as well as the travel time. Quotes ahead of the double-header at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Following a short break after the two rounds at Jerez and Portimão, the action now comes thick and fast for us in WorldSBK. We travel to the races at MotorLand Aragón with more new developments, including for aerodynamics and the chassis which promise to allow us to take the next step forward. We know the areas where we need to work hard and we are doing just that. The track at MotorLand Aragón is very demanding and technical. On one hand, the long straights will be a challenge for us. On the other hand, there are winding sections where we can use the handling of the RR to our advantage. We will do all we can to continue to close the gap to those ahead of us.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We are looking forward to going to Aragón after a short break after Portugal, and to another back-to-back race. The temperatures should undoubtedly be very high, so we have to manage our sessions effectively again and work on our race tyre simulations. We hope that Eugene will bounce back from his DNFs in Portugal and wipe the slate clean and come out fighting at Aragón. On Tom’s side, we think we can build on the result we had in Portugal. He finished reasonably strongly. We know we still have a small deficit but there are very large sections of the Aragón track that will suit the bike very well. We are very positive and hopeful that we can make a fast start on the Friday morning. We can then build on it and we look forward to the two back-to-back rounds. It is going to be a long 14 days for the guys, working hard and maximising the strength of the BMW S 1000 RR.” Tom Sykes: “I am very much looking forward to the double-header in Aragón. We are continuing a string of races in very hot conditions and in the Spanish climate. Obviously we have done some preparation for this, but we have some work to catch up with our opposition. I do believe we have some areas on the circuit where the chassis of the BMW S 1000 RR can be very good. So we will continue our work on Friday where we left off in Portugal and I believe we can go there, keep working in the way that we have been doing recently, and get the best result we can. For now, we still have areas to work on and that’s where we will continue in this upcoming event.” Eugene Laverty: “I’m looking forward to this double header at Aragón. I’ve watched both F1 and MotoGP races at the same track on consecutive weekends lately and it’s been interesting to see many drivers and riders improve on their second visit. With this being my first time riding the BMW S 1000 RR at the Aragón circuit I expect to make strides forward over the course of the two weekends. Last time out at Portimão I really felt that we had a great bike for Sunday but unfortunately I crashed early in both races, one my own doing and the other not. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has done a fantastic job bringing the bike forward over the past few rounds as we’ve worked to resolve our weakness in the slow 1st and 2nd gear corners. We’re only going to get stronger from here on in.” \n"}

We are well-equipped and can hardly wait to take on the challenge that is the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Anything can happen in endurance racing, so it is difficult to make any predictions before the race. However, we have done our homework and are looking to build on what we achieved at Le Castellet and Sepang.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “We are very excited to resume the season at Le Mans and we have worked day and night to prepare the bike. I am pretty sure that with Kenny, Ilya and Markus, we have the best three riders for the world championship. And our reserve rider Vladimir showed at the IDM season-opener at Assen that he is very quick. In the pre-test, together with our partners, we could see that the lap-times were good. We have a really strong team. Also in regards of the mechanics and technical crew under Steven Casaer we are really on a world level, BMW does a tremendous job with the bike and the engine, and Dunlop is a strong tyre partner. I think that we are well prepared and we hope for a strong result.” Kenny Foray: “I’m really excited to go to Le Mans because we have waited such a long time. Of course I always want to race and so I am really happy to be back racing in the FIM EWC. The goal for Le Mans is for sure to get a good result because after the first two races we are very well positioned in the championship. We know that it will not be an easy race but I think that we can be strong. Unfortunately, there will be no spectators at the Le Mans; that will be a strange and new situation for us but I think it is better to have a race like this than no race at all. We will give our best to show the fans watching on TV a strong performance.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I’m really looking forward to this weekend because we did a good job at the test. We showed a good pace and the bike looks really ready for the 24 hours. Our target is to have a very strong qualifying and then to have a strong race over the entire 24 hours. We need to be focused and use our heads. I hope that we can enjoy this long race and have a strong finish.” Markus Reiterberger: “I am very much looking forward to finally going racing again at the Le Mans endurance classic. We are very well prepared. We have had good tests and the team has worked very hard to be able to make good and fast pit stops and find a good set-up for the bike. I am very motivated and have very high expectations. We will make every effort to do well at Le Mans – also with an eye on the World Championship standings. Riding without spectators will be rather strange, as they are the lifeblood of motor racing. It is a shame it has to be like that, but we just have to accept it in the current situation.” Vladimir Leonov: “It’s not my first time at Le Mans; I was there already in 2016. I really like this kind of racing, even if it is a huge challenge and everything can happen. I am really looking forward to be part of the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team at Le Mans and I will try to support them as best as I can.” \n"}

Marco Wittmann (GER, Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM) in ninth and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) in tenth position also finished in the points.Having started the race from ninth and seventh on the grid, Auer and Glock were able to gain a few places at the start and kept pace with the leading group. Unlike their competitors, the pair decided to go for an early tyre change and made their mandatory pit stops on the tenth lap. The fresh tyres then helped them to make up those decisive seconds on the cars ahead on subsequent laps. Once all drivers had made their pits tops, the duo had moved up to second and third positions and it did not take long for them to pass leader Jamie Green (GBR, Audi). Glock was on course for victory until one lap from the end, when Auer made a thrilling move to overtake him and secure his first win for BMW.Timo Glock is the best-placed BMW representative in the drivers’ standings, moving up to fourth place with 52 points.

We are delighted with our first win of the season. Congratulations to Lucas Auer, Timo Glock and BMW Team RMG, who did everything right today. The one-two result was an important signal for us. Timo and Lucas were racing with a very good, consistent pace. However, our strategy was decisive as we found the right time to make the pit stops. Lucas stopped really early and made correspondingly good progress up through the field with Timo. Tyre management was the next factor to play a decisive part. Even though Sheldon van der Linde unfortunately lost the position he had secured in qualifying, a total of five BMWs finished in the points. That is very encouraging for the upcoming races. We are already looking forward to Assen and being able to welcome our fans back to the circuit there.”Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“The show was just right today. We finished off the day with a one-two result. Massive congratulations to the entire team.

It is disappointing really, as we were actually doing well. Congratulations to Lucas and Timo!”Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 7th, Race: 2nd, Drivers’ standings: 4th, 52 points):“Of course, it hurts when you have to surrender victory on the final lap. In the middle part of the race I tried to pull away a bit and increase the gap between me and Lucas. I suddenly got a bit of pick-up that made the car understeer. That allowed Lucas to close the gap and I realised that he still had one DRS opportunity left. He was able to mount an attack at the finish. I could have pushed back against it but overall, I wanted to think about the bigger picture. If I had started a battle with Lucas, the Audis behind us would have nipped past us on both sides with their fresh tyres. It was important for me to claim this one-two result for BMW.”Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 9th, Race: 1st, Drivers’ standings: 9th, 35 points):“I am still lost for words. I think that was the most intense race I have ever experienced in the DTM, as an error could have been fatal. I was able to manage the tyres well, the strategy and pit stop were perfect. The car was also spot-on. And putting it all together on the final lap - it doesn’t get any better than that.”Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 12th, Race: 12th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 20 points):“Firstly, I am delighted for Lucas, Timo and the whole BMW team.

We have to do a bit better in qualifying and then we have a chance of winning.”Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 4th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 29 points):“I really lost a lot of time at the start. That was very disappointing and I don’t know exactly what happened. We will have to take a look at that. It really is very annoying, after starting from fourth place. The car went really well today. Lucas won and Timo finished second. Congratulations to both of them. That showed what is possible with our cars.”\n"}

A strong recovery performance saw Timo Glock (GER) finish the fifth race of the 2020 DTM season in fourth place as the best-placed BMW driver. On a circuit that dried out after a wet start, Glock moved up ten positions after starting the race from 14th to claim his best result of the season in the iQOO BMW M4 DTM.

Jonathan Aberdein (RSA, CATL BMW M4 DTM) finished in 14th position. Victory in the fifth DTM race of the season went to René Rast (GER, Audi).Glock spun out in wet conditions right at the start of the qualifying session and was unable to complete another timed lap. All drivers chose to go into the race with wet-weather tyres and Glock made a good start. An early switch to dry tyres saw him continue to move up through the field. Wittmann and Eng were also able to improve in the early stage and seemed to be on course for the podium after their pit stops before falling back again as the race drew to a close.The best-placed BMW representative in the drivers’ standings was Wittmann in fifth position with 38 points. The sixth DTM race of the 2020 season will take place on Sunday.Reactions to the fifth DTM race of 2020 at the Lausitzring.Rudolf Dittrich (General Manager BMW Motorsport Vehicle Development):“We all saw an exciting race. This third race at the Lausitzring provided mixed and treacherous weather conditions for the third time. We had a very wet and slippery circuit for qualifying before the asphalt started drying during the race. Philipp Eng made a very good start and Marco Wittmann held his ground with the leading pack. On the other hand, we also lost some places during the confusion in the wet conditions at the start, however all the drivers had a largely error-free race and we were able to reclaim some positions. The timing of the decision to switch from wet-weather tyres to slicks was decisive as the circuit dried out. Our strategy allowed us to gain plenty of time and improve by a few places. Timo Glock’s recovery performance was particularly impressive as he moved up from 14th on the grid to fourth. Overall though, we were unable to keep up with the pace of the fastest Audis. We have to continue to work on that to make sure that we improve the setup for qualifying and the race tomorrow.”Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 5th, Race: 5th, Drivers’ standings: 5th, 38 points):“Fifth place in qualifying and fifth in the race; that’s pretty normal overall. The Audis remain the dominant force, even here. Our good pit stop strategy made us competitive for a time but to be honest, you have to say that the gap we saw in qualifying was also reflected in the race. We are driving at the limit but the Audi guys are maybe able to take care of the tyres a bit better. You notice that at the end of the race with the increased wear and when the tyre deteriorates. That is quite a difficult situation for us and we will have to make sure that we improve our performance as much as possible. But we are not giving up.”Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 14th, Race: 4th, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 34 points):“I have already apologised repeatedly to the team and to BMW, but now I'd like to make it official: that mistake this morning was the most stupid one I have ever made. You simply can’t park the car like that on the third lap with the weather as it was. I didn’t pay attention for a second, lost control and made a mistake. So, I was just concentrating on one thing in the race - payback - and giving my all for the guys. And that is just what we did. The overtaking manoeuvre against Mike Rockenfeller was a tough one, but it had to be. I had to get past and I took my chance. As far as I’m concerned, if the race had continued for another two laps, then I might have been able to catch Robin. However, I am happy with fourth place. We have to think about what adjustments we could have made if we had been doing better, but there’s no point thinking about could have, would have. We scored some good points and that was important.”Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 6th, Race: 12th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 10 points):“Qualifying was good, but the race was poor. We stayed out too long. You pay for that decision when everybody goes past you. The pace was good, but overtaking was difficult.”Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 7th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 20 points):“Perfect start, perfect stop lap, perfect pit stop. The race execution was really good. However, after ten laps I had no more grip on the rear tyres. We have to investigate what caused that. It wasn’t so much fun towards the end.”Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 12th, Race: 14th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 5 points):“It was a very tough race. It’s always tricky when you have this mix of wet and dry conditions. I am not sure how I lost so much time, maybe more on the out-lap than on the pit stop. We need to analyse it more in detail and make sure we are spot on for tomorrow.”Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 8th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings: 9th, 28 points):“The race was not ideal. I had a really bad start, recovered well after that and made up some positions. Then the DRS did not work right which was so frustrating. I think there could have at least been a P6 in it. But I just have to accept it and move on to tomorrow.”\n"}

After the current season drew to a close with the six races in Berlin (GER), BMW i Andretti Motorsport lays the first steps for Season 7 of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. After his successful maiden season, Maximilian Günther (GER) will drive the BMW iFE.21 for the team in 2021. Alexander Sims (GBR) will move within Formula E after two years as a BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver. With his win in only his third race for BMW i Andretti Motorsport at the Santiago E-Prix (CHI), Günther got off to a great start and went down in Formula E history as the youngest winner of all time. With his second win of the season at the finale in Berlin (GER), he delivered another highlight. He finished his maiden season ninth in the driver’s standings, with two wins and one second place. Sims ended his second season as a BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver 13th in the driver’s standings. His big moment was at the season opener in Diriyah (KSA), where he secured pole position in both races and celebrated his first Formula E win on the Saturday. After a total of 24 races for the team, Sims is striking out in a new direction in Season 7. Who will join Günther to take the wheel of the second BMW iFE.21 in Season 7 will be announced in due course. “I’m delighted to take on the next Formula E season with Maximilian Günther. It is incredibly valuable for the team to have a driver so focussed, professional and fast despite his young age at BMW i Andretti Motorsport. His two victories this season in Santiago and Berlin were real highlights. Maximilian will build on the experience gained in Season 6. The team and he will be even better in tune with each other. All this will hopefully lead to even more success on the racetrack,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “As far as the departure of Alexander Sims is concerned, the key thing for me is that we go our separate ways in Formula E by mutual agreement. We had two great seasons together. Alexander has matured from a rookie to a winner at BMW i Andretti Motorsport. It was a great pleasure to watch him during his big weekend in Diriyah. We regret that we won’t race together next season, wish him all the best for the next chapter in his Formula E career and look forward to the sporting contest on the track.” Sims said: “I would like to thank every single member of BMW i Andretti Motorsport for their hard work and belief in me over the last two seasons of Formula E. The working relationships have turned into friendships and I value that enormously. There have been a lot of great memories made and experiences enjoyed together, notably my first pole position in New York and first race win in Diriyah. The BMW family brought me into the professional motorsport world and has enabled me to go on an incredible journey that I am truly thankful for. Next season I will join a new racing family in Formula E, but I look forward to seeing all my BMW friends around the paddock in the coming seasons, and wish the team all the best in the future.” Günther said: “I am delighted to continue racing for BMW i Andretti Motorsport in Formula E, and to go in pursuit of titles with them. I have felt right at home from the moment I was included in the squad of BMW works drivers last year. I am very happy to remain a part of the BMW family. We have made it onto the podium three times in our first year together, twice as winners. In the Drivers’ Championship, we were in contention for second place until the final race. That shows how strong our package was. Formula E will be promoted to FIA World Championship status next season, and the first World Championship title is extra motivation for us. We will continue to work hard and do all we can to continue to make a statement and enjoy more success next year.”\n"}

In doing so, he achieved another milestone for BMW in the popular touring car series. From seventh on the grid, Wittmann started strongly in the Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM and pulled off a late overtaking manoeuvre to pass Robin Frijns (NED, Audi) and take third place. Timo Glock (GER, iQOO BMW M4 DTM), Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM) and Jonathan Aberdein (RSA, CATL BMW M4 DTM) also showed clear signs of improvement after a tough qualifying session, finishing sixth, seventh and ninth in the race itself. In hot conditions, and with tyre wear a significant factor at the Lausitzring, the BMW DTM teams focussed on the race when setting up the BMW M4 DTM. The consequence of that was the inability to back up Saturday’s fine performance in qualifying, and thus had to start Sunday’s race from towards the back of the grid. However, the majority of the drivers fought back strongly to pick up valuable points, with Wittmann even claiming a well-earned podium. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) also found himself in the top five after his early pit stop, but then paid the price for this courageous strategy as his tyres suffered in the final few laps. He came home in 15th place, just behind Lucas Auer (AUT, BMW Bank M4 DTM). Victory went to René Rast (GER, Audi). This coming weekend, the Lausitzring is again the venue for the next round of the DTM, which will this time take place on a longer layout. Reactions to the fourth DTM race of the 2020 season at the Lausitzring. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“Marco Wittmann’s podium is a real highlight, as it is the 300th podium for BMW in the DTM – another milestone in our long history in this racing series. Marco drove a superb race and pulled off a brilliant and intelligent overtaking manoeuvre shortly before the finish, which ultimately earned him third place. Compliments to everyone on landing four BMW M4 DTMs in third, sixth, seventh and ninth places after the tough qualifying session. We focussed on the race from the outset today, which meant making a compromise in qualifying. We must do a better job of coping with that compromise next week, as the race is obviously easier the further up the grid you start. I feel sorry for Sheldon van der Linde. We called him in early for his pit stop, which catapulted him up the field. Unfortunately, his tyres gave up in the end. On the whole, we have taken a big step forward compared to Spa-Francorchamps. We must back that up next week. Congratulations to René Rast on his win.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 7th, Race: 3rd, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 28 points):“I had an extremely good start and a super first lap, after which I was already up to third place. I then battled with Robin Frijns and René Rast for the lead. I finally got past Robin on the penultimate lap. Nonetheless, you have to say that the gap to the Audis is still very big in qualifying and in the race. Third place is a decent enough result. However, our goal is to challenge for titles, and we are a long way off doing that at the moment. We must work hard to close that gap.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 12th, Race: 6th, Driver’s standings: 9th, 22 points):“After today’s qualifying, in which all the BMW drivers had issues with the car, I am definitely in a more positive frame of mind. The balance was good again in the race. I really had a good first lap and climbed into the top ten. I then had good speed and we came into the pits too early. That made the second stint very long, which meant I had to look after my tyres carefully. I did that well, and managed the DRS well. Generally speaking, I can be happy with that.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 15th, Race: 14th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 10 points):“That was a weekend to forget. We found a few things on the car after yesterday, but they did not really result in us making much progress. We have a few issues that need resolving in order to do better next weekend.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 11th, Race: 7th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 16 points):“I did not have a good starting position – that was the main problem. The start was not very good. I was a bit unfortunate in the first two corners, in which I fell back through the field when Ferdinand Habsburg returned to the track. After that, it was a reasonable race with a lot of battles. The pit stop was perfect. I am pleased to see BMW on the podium again. That is a great sign and I hope I am up there next time.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 14th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 5 points):“That was a tough day for me. I had a few problems with my car’s balance in qualifying. However, I fought back well in the race and came home ninth.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 10th, Race: 15th, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 26 points):“We went for a risky strategy today and came in for a tyre change on lap eight. That initially allowed me to gain a lot of positions, and may have looked really good from the outside. Ultimately, however, our risk did not pay off. In the final few laps, there was nothing I could do to hold off the cars behind me. These things happen sometimes. I will take the positives from yesterday into the next race weekend.”\n"}

Hopefully we will be able to reinforce that in the upcoming races.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 5th, Race: 5th, Driver’s standings: 8th, 14 points):“That was a massive improvement compared with Spa-Francorchamps. I had a strong car, especially at the start, but I was stuck behind René Rast which is why I pitted slightly earlier than planned. That wasn’t ideal because it saw me lose ground on the front-runners. Despite that I am happy with the top-five finish.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 14th, Race: 12th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 10 points):“We’ve had difficulties finding the right pace the whole weekend which is why we opted for a different strategy with an early pit stop.

It feels like it’s a lottery.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 10th, Race: 14th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 3 points):“I had a difficult qualifying, so I had to start from right down the grid.

Undoubtedly the most extraordinary season of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, drew to a close with the sixth race in the space of nine days in Berlin-Tempelhof (GER). BMW i Andretti Motorsport looks back on three wins and another podium finish, and finishes the second season as a BMW works team with 118 points and in fifth place in the team standings. In the final race, Maximilian Günther (GER) and Alexander Sims (GBR) in 12th and 13th only just missed out on the points. After his first year at BMW i Andretti Motorsport and with two wins during the season – one of which was at the finale in Berlin – and a second place, Günther finished ninth in the driver standings with 69 points. Sims won one race and started from pole position twice. He ended the season with 49 points and 13th in the overall standings. In the final race, it was Günther who showed strong pace. He set the best time in the practice session and he was also fastest in qualifying group one. But since this group was at a huge disadvantage due to the grip levels on the track, the best time only earned him 18th on the grid. Sims started from 15th on the grid. Over the 45 minutes plus one lap race, Günther showed his potential, gradually working his way up the field and was fighting for eighth place when he was pushed out during a duel with Robin Frijns (NED, Envision Virgin Racing) and lost a lot of positions on the track. Sims was involved in some close battles, ultimately finishing 13th, right behind his team-mate. Reactions to race 11 in Berlin: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director): “The six races in nine days in Berlin were the incredible conclusion of a just as incredible Formula E season. Congratulations to António Félix da Costa and the DS Techeetah Team on their deserved title win. When we got off to a fantastic start in Season 6 with a win and two pole positions for Alexander Sims in Diriyah in November 2019, we had no idea of the global consequences that would come as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We’re happy that we were able to finish the season on the racetrack, even though regrettably it was without our fans. BMW i Andretti Motorsport ended the season with three wins, a second place and fifth place in the team standings. It’s a shame that it wasn’t enough for a better result, despite the good job from the team. As already mentioned, Alexander Sims had a successful start to the season, which he was unfortunately unable to build on, particularly in the races in Berlin. Maximilian Günther had a very good rookie year in our team. His wins in Santiago and Berlin were real highlights. Ultimately, what we were lacking to make us one of the main contenders in the title race down to the wire was consistency. We weren’t able to activate our performance from the start of the season often enough in Berlin. We will work on this intensively looking ahead to Season 7 and hopefully improve further in the coming year.” Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport, team standings: 5th place):“Unfortunately, the final races of the season didn’t go as we had hoped. . Maximilian Günther was incredibly fast in the practice session today. And his performance in qualifying was outstanding, but unfortunately, like everyone else in qualifying group one, he didn’t stand a chance. Despite that, he worked his way up the field well during the race. Then he was unfortunately pushed out in the duel with Robin Frijns, who clearly had a problem with his car, and lots of other cars were able to slip through on the inside. Unfortunately, Alexander Sims also finished outside the points. All in all, the season finale here in Berlin has a bitter aftertaste. We may have won one of the six races, but apart from that we missed out on a lot of points and dropped down from second to fifth place in the team standings. Unfortunately, we were unable to build on our performances from the first half of the season. We learned a great deal as a team this season, which saw us become more of a unit. But if you want to be fighting for the title at the end you need to finish in the points regularly. We didn’t manage that. Looking ahead to next season, we will analyse in detail what we need to do better to take the next step in our development as a team.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, starting position: 18th place, race result: 12th place, points: 69, driver standings: 9th place):“Today’s race had a very bitter end. I think we were the fastest in the field all day. You could see that in the practice session, as well as in my qualifying group and in the way I moved up through the field during the race. Then, for things to go the way they did just a few laps before the end is a real shame. But I have to accept it. Overall I think we still had a strong season, even though it isn’t reflected in our position in the championship. We brought home wins and podiums, were often quick in qualifying and were able to show that we can catch up from behind in the races, which is really important in Formula E. Unfortunately, this wasn’t rewarded with good results often enough. It’s important to me to stress that I felt right at home in the team from day one, and I really enjoyed the season. Congrats to António Félix da Costa and DS Techeetah on winning the titles.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, starting position: 15th place, race result: 13th place, points: 49, driver standings: 13th place):“It’s a real shame that a season that started off so well for me in Diriyah ended this way. I just couldn’t find the pace here in Berlin that I had earlier on in the season. When we arrived here, I thought that we would be fighting for a top-three spot in the drivers’ championship. So to fall so far down the table is quite bitter. I feel really sorry for the team, who had an outstanding attitude to work, right down to the final race. I’d like to thank them all for their efforts – and many congrats to my former team-mate António Félix da Costa on winning the title.” The BMW i Safety Cars.BMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 6.

The BMW i Andretti drivers finished outside the points in the penultimate race of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E Championship. Alexander Sims (GBR) started from 14th on the grid and came home 11th. After his crash in Sunday’s race, Maximilian Günther (GER) was again unlucky. He was hit from behind by another car at the start and suffered radiator damage, which forced him into the pits after the opening lap. After lengthy repairs, he came back out for a few ‘check laps’ shortly before the end of the race. Reactions to race 10 in Berlin: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport, team standings: 3rd place):“Unfortunately, it was another tough day for the team here in Berlin. It started very well, with the fastest time for Maximilian in practice. We were also confident in qualifying, but the grip on the track improved so enormously that the cars in the later groups were all able to go faster than us. The damage to the rear of Maximilian’s car then meant that his race was basically over before it started. Towards the end of the race, we headed back out for a few laps, just to check all the systems for tomorrow. Alexander drove a solid race, but narrowly missed out on the points in the end. Going into the final race we are third in the Team competition. We at least want to defend that with a good result.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, starting position: 16th place, race result: DNF, points: 69, driver standings: 6th place):“That was obviously a disappointing race. We do not have the consistency we require here in Berlin – particularly in qualifying. On top of that, having to start in Group 1 obviously does not make life any easier. We saw today that the track became so massively quicker that I had no chance of securing a place at the front of the grid, despite setting the fastest time in my group. Despite this, I had the feeling that we had a better car today than of late. However, when you are in the middle of the pack and are hit twice from behind, as I was, and have to come in to have your radiator repaired, then that is your race over. That is Formula E for you. We have to live with that, and must do our best again tomorrow to end the season on a high.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, starting position: 14th place, race result: 11th place, points: 49, driver standings: 12th place):“That was quite an eventful race. I had a few good battles, but the fact remains that we are lacking a little pace here, particularly with my car. The goal for the final race is to turn the corner again in terms of speed, and to end the season with a good result.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race.

Both riders for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Eugene Laverty (IRL) and Tom Sykes (GBR), are normally at home on race tracks around the world. Now they have had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the many facets of the BMW Group during a visit to Munich (GER). They were accompanied by a camera crew during their visit. The result is a series of three short films that show the riders from a different perspective and provide some exclusive behind-the-scenes insights at BMW Group in Munich. Part 2: Exploring the BMW Group. After Sykes and Laverty learned all about the history of BMW and BMW Motorrad in the first part of the film series, it’s then on to the present and up and away to start. Exposed, on the roof of the BMW ‘four-cylinder’, the corporate headquarters of the BMW Group – with a breathtaking view of Munich, the Olympic stadium and various BMW locations – the two racers are welcomed by BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. Right next to the ‘four-cylinder’ is BMW Welt, which opened in 2007, in which all of the BMW Group brands come together under one roof. With more than three million guests each year, BMW Welt is one of the most-visited attractions in Bavaria. Matt Champion explains some of the highlights of the exhibition to the duo. They take particular interest in the BMW Group brands with British origins: MINI and Rolls-Royce. Laverty and Sykes have the up close and personal wonderful feeling of sitting in a handcrafted Rolls-Royce, and learn interesting facts about how much attention to detail the luxury brand invests. And it goes without saying that a trip to BMW Welt couldn’t end without visiting the BMW Motorrad department to round things off. Then things turn to motorsport. Bongers guides the two WorldSBK riders through the engine test bench of BMW Motorrad Motorsport and explains the details of development. Just how close everyone is literally at BMW is demonstrated by the fact that Sykes and Laverty only need to go around the corner after leaving the BMW Motorrad Motorsport building to get to BMW Motorsport. There they are greeted by Rudolf Dittrich, General Manager BMW Motorsport Vehicle Development, who shows the two motorcycle racers their four-wheeled colleagues’ world. BMW Motorrad Motorsport and BMW Motorsport collaborate in various areas, making use of synergies. Laverty and Sykes learn all about cars such as the BMW M4 GT4 and the BMW M8 GTE, which they feel at home in right away. They also have the opportunity to take an exclusive look at the BMW Motorsport simulator, as well as at the workshop in which the Formula E BMW i.FE20 is currently being prepared for its next outing. You can watch the film ‘Exploring the BMW Group’ online on the BMW Motorrad YouTube channel: https:\/\/bit.ly\/WorldSBK-Munich-Visit-Part-2 \n"}
{"prompt":"Company confirms the first-time extension of the model range in the premium mid-range class by a five-door high-performance automobile prototype, which will be seen driving around in the vicinity of the development centre in Garching near Munich – racetrack tests on the Nordschleife of the Nürburgring to follow. ->","completion":" Munich. How about an extra-large and highly variable luggage compartment in a high-performance sports car? What is presently still a rhetorical question will soon become a concrete offer. A few weeks prior to the world premiere of the all-new BMW M3 Sedan, there are increasing signs of unparalleled model diversity in the range of premium mid-range BMW M automobiles. Together with the all-new BMW M4 Coupe, the new BMW M3 Sedan will be celebrating its world premiere in September 2020. It is also no secret that the new edition of the BMW M4 Convertible is to follow next year. However, attentive observers will soon be able to catch a glimpse of the prototype of a new high-performance automobile. In Garching near Munich, home of the BMW M GmbH, work is being carried out on a further dream-come-true: For the first time in the history of the BMW M GmbH, the model range will be complemented by a BMW M3 Touring.M-specific performance combined with an increase in available space and the intelligent functionality of a Touring model – this was previously reserved exclusively for the BMW M5. Both in its second generation in 1992 and in its fourth in 2007, the high-performance business sedan was accompanied by a Touring. This is not the first time both the M community and developers at the BMW M GmbH have been fascinated by idea of transferring this vehicle concept to the BMW M3. Exactly 20 years ago, a corresponding prototype was launched based on the third generation of the BMW M3. The then aim of proving that the high flexibility and seamless integration of high-performance sports cars with specific body features could be incorporated into the BMW M3 manufacturing process was achieved. In the sixth generation of the BMW M3, it will not end with mere theoretical considerations and product-technical test series.The 6-cylinder M TwinPower turbo engine beneath the bonnet has been set. 5 doors and a highly variable luggage compartment are precisely what have been long awaited by fans of this model. As the fourth model variant, the BMW M3 Touring fulfils the hopes of all those who wish to take the M-specific interplay of racing-oriented performance and everyday suitability to the extreme. Never before has a premium mid-range class estate car offered so much driving fun and precision. Nor was there ever more functional utility available in a thoroughbred sports car.Further speculation on engine and performance is quite welcome. But wide axles, conspicuously large front air intakes and four exhaust tailpipes at the rear leave no doubt that the iconic M DNA will be fully perceptible despite the car’s new body design.The first BMW M3 Touring is still in the early stage of its approx. two-year series development process. As in the case of other BMW M high-performance sports cars, the following also applies to the BMW M3 Touring: Whenever the prototype has been given the go-ahead for test drives on public roads, it means that the decisive step towards series maturity has been taken. Not only there will it soon be regularly sighted. As with all other BMW M models, the intensive testing and tuning process for the BMW M3 Touring will take place on the Nordschleife of the Nürburgring, because the first BMW M3 Touring is, after all, first and foremost a BMW M3.\n"}
{"prompt":"Top model in the range of plug-in hybrids for the new BMW 5 Series featuring a straight six-cylinder petrol engine and four-wheel drive for a combination of maximum energy efficiency and dynamic performance. Extension of the BMW 5 Series to include five plug-in hybrid models. ->","completion":" Munich. With a ten-year plan for sustainability, the BMW Group is underscoring its commitment to the goals of the Paris climate agreement, the main focus being on the expansion of electric mobility. More than 500,000 electrified vehicles were sold by the end of 2019 and this figure will most likely rise to over 1 million by the end of 2021. The BMW 5 Series makes a substantial contribution towards achieving both past and future goals. With almost 50,000 units, BMW 5 Series plug-in hybrid models were the most successful electrified models in the BMW Group’s portfolio worldwide in 2019.Extension of the BMW 5 Series to include five plug-in hybrid models.With an increase from two to five models featuring innovative plug-in hybrid drive by November 2020, the new BMW 5 Series offers the largest range of PHEVs within one BMW Group model series.The latest generation of BMW eDrive technology in conjunction with a four-cylinder petrol engine powers the BMW 530e plug-in hybrid models. July 2020 saw the launch of the new BMW 530e Sedan and the new BMW 530e xDrive Sedan .In November 2020, the new BMW 530e Touring and the new BMW 530e xDrive Touring will be launched.Top of the range model: The new BMW 545e xDrive Sedan.The new BMW 545e xDrive Sedan features a synchronous electric motor delivering a maximum power output of 80 kW\/109 hp, which is combined with an efficient straight six-cylinder petrol engine with BMW TwinPower Turbo Technology and 210 kW\/286 hp, together generating an overall system output of 290 kW\/394 hp. Power is distributed as required to all four wheels via an 8-speed Steptronic transmission and intelligent BMW xDrive four-wheel drive. Maximum system torque is 600 Nm and top speed is reached at 250 km\/h, whilst a speed of 140 km\/h is possible in purely electric operation. From a standstill, the new BMW 545e xDrive accelerates to a speed of 100 km\/h in just 4.6 seconds. Thus, the BMW 545e xDrive clearly excels as the most dynamic of all BMW six-cylinder plug-in hybrids.Thanks to intelligently controlled interaction between both drive systems, the new BMW 545e xDrive combines the best of two worlds. It facilitates not only purely electric driving in urban traffic and efficient commuting between home and the workplace, but also excels through dynamic performance and comfortable long-distance travel. With a purely electric range of 49 – 57 kilometres* and an average fuel consumption of 2.3 – 2.2 litres\/100 km, the new BMW 545e xDrive combines brand-typical driving dynamics and a high level of long-distance ride comfort with extremely efficient use of resources.The latest plug-in hybrid model of the BMW 5 Series is fitted with a 400V lithium-ion battery which is positioned under the rear seat in order to save space. With a luggage volume of 410 litres, the transport capacity of the BMW 545e xDrive is only slightly smaller than of those model variants which are fitted with a conventional engine.Different driving modes for maximum efficiency in accordance with the relevant driving style and situation.In order to make optimum use of the combination of the straight six-cylinder engine featuring ultra-smooth running characteristics and eDrive technology in all driving situations, the BMW 545e xDrive supports the driver in numerous ways in terms of energy management. Various driving modes, some of which can be individualised in their operation, are simply selected by pressing the corresponding button on the centre console.The HYBRID mode is the default setting, which ensures a balanced set-up and an intelligent interaction between combustion engine and electric motor. It is also possible to select ELECTRIC mode as the standard setting via the iDrive menu. In HYBRID mode, the electric motor is predominantly used. The combustion engine only kicks in at higher speeds or under intensive load conditions. Since the system is linked to the navigation system, the interaction between combustion engine and electric motor can be adapted more precisely to the route profile, topography and other driving situations in an anticipatory manner. The electric range is increased by recuperation in overrun and braking phases. The energy supply saved in this way can then be used specifically for locally emission-free driving through urban areas and the arrival at the defined destination.By pressing the HYBRID button twice, an efficiency-optimised version of this operating mode (HYBRID ECO PRO) is activated. The coasting function on the overrun, among other things, contributes to a further reduction in consumption. The navigation and sensor data-supported control system also optimises the effectiveness of braking energy recovery. When approaching a junction or a vehicle driving ahead, for example, infinitely adaptive recuperation can be put to particularly intensive use for the purpose of deceleration.In SPORT mode, the electric motor supports the straight six-cylinder petrol engine when the overall system output of 290 kW\/394 hp is fully needed. The set-up is designed for dynamic performance, and the gearshift program is sporty.The ELECTRIC mode, on the other hand, enables locally purely emission-free driving up to 57 kilometres* and up to 140 km\/h.Special sounds for a special driving experience.The new “ready to drive sound” produced by the BMW 545e xDrive is the result of the collaboration with composer Hans Zimmer and is designed to trigger joyful anticipation of the electric drive when the driver enters the vehicle and presses the Start\/Stop button.A distinctive sound created especially for electrified BMW models is used for the purpose of acoustic pedestrian protection, emitted via a speaker system. The sound design in the low speed range of up to 30 km\/h radiates a vibrant acoustic presence, though without impairing the acoustic comfort of vehicle occupants.Likewise, via the vehicle audio system, “Active Sound Design” provides for an authentic and, in the SPORT mode of the Driving Experience Control Switch, for a particularly intense and pronounced sound.Electric mobility meets digitalisation: Digital services for the plug-in hybrid models of the BMW 5 Series.The BMW Group also offers innovative digital services that actively contribute towards increasing the attractiveness of electric driving even further. The BMW eDrive Zone service facilitates the automatic switching over of the drive system to purely electric mode when entering an urban low-emission zone and similar inner-city areas. In addition, local emission-free driving with a BMW plug-in hybrid model is rewarded through the globally unique loyalty programme BMW Points.Apart from filling stations, the navigation system also displays public charging points. When selecting a charging station, the driver is also provided with a forecast on its occupation status as well as recommendations for nearby restaurants or cafés. Moreover, BMW enables BMW Charging customers to reserve an enabled charging station for a limited period of time.Furthermore, other products from BMW Charging also offer the possibility of comfortable charging at home and when out and about. These also comprise various versions of the Wallbox, including installation service, individual offers for the purchase of electricity and access to the world’s largest network of public charging stations comprising more than 155,000 charging points in Europe alone. Preconditioning of the interior by means of auxiliary heating and air conditioning ensures optimised comfort during any season. If the preconditioning system is activated during the charging process after defining a specific departure time, the system also guarantees the full electric range in drive mode. The system is controlled either from inside the vehicle or conveniently via the My BMW app. * The data on the electrical range are the values determined in the WLTP test cycle. \n"}

The result is a series of three short films that show the riders from different angle and provide some exclusive behind-the-scenes insights at the BMW Group in Munich. Part 1: Discovering the BMW Heritage. The first part of the series concentrates on the history of BMW and BMW Motorrad. 2020 sees the boxer engine celebrating its 100th anniversary. That’s reason enough for Sykes and Laverty to explore the newest boxer engine model, the BMW R 18, Munich and the roots of BMW. Both are avowed fans of the BMW R 18. “The perfect way to relax,” is how Sykes describes a ride on a heritage bike. Laverty agrees: “After an exhausting weekend at the circuit, it is great to leave the racing position behind and go for a relaxing cruise.” In Munich, the two WorldSBK riders enjoy the exclusive opportunity to take the First Edition of the new BMW R 18 for a spin. After an introduction from Roland Stocker from the R 18 project, they take to the streets of Munich for the first part of their tour, the BMW Group Classic. Today, BMW Group Classic is located in the same halls where the first BMW boxer engine was constructed 100 years ago. After a welcoming address from Ulrich Knieps, Head of BMW Group Classic, Ralph Huber and Benjamin Voss take the two Motorrad racers through the “hallowed halls” where countless treasures from the history of BMW are on display. Sykes and Laverty find out everything there is to know about how motorcycle development started at BMW and hear anecdotes from the history of the BMW Group. For example, the two WorldSBK riders get to know a racing bike from another segment, the BMW R 80 G\/S, with which Gaston Rahier (FRA) won the Dakar Rally in 1985. Other funny stories, such as how Elvis Presley’s BMW 507 brings out the entertainer in Tom Sykes, are portrayed in the film “Discovering the BMW Heritage”. After visiting BMW Group Classic, Sykes and Laverty it’s time for Bavarian traditions. Together with Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, and BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers, they round off the day in a typical Munich establishment and reflect on their impressions of the \"BMW history lesson\" and the BMW R 18 ride through Munich.

In the Superpole race he crossed the finish line in 20th place while in race two he fought his way up into 12th place. Sykes and Laverty started the morning’s Superpole race from fourth and ninth on the grid on their BMW S 1000 RRs. Sykes maintained fourth place until the fourth lap, before dropping down to sixth in a close battle for positions. He then fought a great duel with Scott Redding (GBR) for fifth place. After ten laps he crossed the finish line in sixth place. Laverty was nudged by a rival after entering turn five and fell. The Irishman entered the pit briefly, but re-joined the race and finished in 20th place. The second race in the afternoon was an eventful affair. Sykes and Lafferty started from sixth and tenth on the grid. Sykes dropped down several positions in the first turns, which put him in eleventh place in the interim. As the race progressed, he moved his way back up the field and ended up finishing in seventh place. Laverty was unlucky once again. After a good start, he was lying in seventh place when he fell again in turn five - and was the first of many riders to hit the floor in that corner during the race. Laverty continued the race once again, getting ever closer to finishing in the points, and overtaking manoeuvres in the closing phase saw him move up into twelfth place, securing four points. The next stop on the calendar of the WorldSBK 2020 season is MotorLand Aragón (ESP). A double-header is scheduled there for the final weekend in August and the first weekend in September. Quotes after race two at Portimão. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “In general, it was a pretty satisfying day. We achieved that we can show a more stable performance over race distance. This morning, starting from fourth on the grid, Tom claimed a well-deserved sixth place in a tough battle. That was satisfying and showed the chances for the second race. Tom had a good start, but then he struggled in the first corners, especially corner five, and lost a few seconds. Due to a few opponents’ falls, he slipped up to seventh place. After the first laps, his pace was between position four and seventh and was again stable, even if we had the same problem with the engine performance as yesterday. All in all, it was a solid performance. Eugene’s day was quite unlucky. He was involved in a crash with Chaz Davies in this morning’s Superpole race. In the main race, Eugene got off to a very good start, but unfortunately fell through his own fault at the notorious turn five and was then able to fight his way up to twelfth place. We will now analyse the lap times. We have definitely made technical progress this weekend which should bring us forward in the upcoming races.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The sprint race turned out to be a good race for Tom; he rode pretty hard and I’m pleased he could get up into sixth position. It was probably the best race he has had in a while, so I am happy about that. Eugene unfortunately got taken out by another rider which summarises his weekend really; when he finds momentum, he gets taken out. Despite that he picked up 10th position on the grid for race two and made a reasonably good start, obviously desperate to get himself further up the field but unfortunately ran hot into T5 and lost the front, but managing to re-join the race and claw points back for 12th. Tom got off the line well for race two but got swallowed up into T1 dropping down to P13. He did well to battle through the field and with riders dropping out it promoted him up, but I think with the deficit on horsepower it really shows it up. Again, with that replaced I think we can be fighting for regular podiums and we know that. The bike is handing beautifully, it corners well, it brakes well and the electronics work good. We could just do with that extra bit of grunt and top speed to make this bike potentially a race winning package. I’d just like to add a huge thank you to all of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team staff; it has been a difficult two weeks on the road from Jerez last week, to Portimão this week and the work our team has put has been second to none. The guys will now have a well-earned break before heading into the back to back rounds four and five at Aragón in a fortnights’ time where we will be recharged and giving it our all.” Tom Sykes: “It’s been one of those weekends. We definitely had some limitations, mainly on straight-line performance but we just kept working hard. The whole of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had a good plan, we tried to utilise what we had available to our best advantage so having said that, in some areas we were very close to where we needed to be. I do believe there are positives to take, I think everyone has seen I have been struggling on engine performance. Especially off the start going into first, second and third gear I lose a lot of track position, but hopefully this is something we can address in the short term but for now we have to be pleased with what we are getting out of the chassis. I have enjoyed the races today. The track was testing and a lot of people over-stepped the mark and to be honest to come away sixth, seventh and eighth is not what my CV is happy with, but it’s all about building those blocks and getting into the next phase of the programme.” Eugene Laverty: “To hit the deck in both races today was devastating. In the Superpole race, I got caught up in the Chaz Davies crash. Chaz tried to overtake me and took me out so it’s a case of wrong place at the wrong time. In the final race, I made a great start, gaining six positions and I was going for it from the start but unfortunately I lost the front in T5. I remounted to try get back some positions and after a few laps I understood why I crashed. It was because the track conditions today were a lot greasier than the rest of the weekend. I wasn’t cautious enough, I was on the attack from the get go and ultimately it cost me. I regained positions to get twelfth place which is the least I could do for the team after having such a tough weekend.” \n"}

The ‘Autódromo Internacional do Algarve’ is hosting the third round of the 2020 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). In Saturday's race, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Eugene Laverty (IRL) both reached the top ten, finishing in eighth and tenth positions. Sykes just missed out on a front row spot as he finished fourth in Superpole qualification on Saturday morning. His team-mate Laverty struggled with a technical issue during the morning practice session. However, the team managed to get his bike ready for action in time for Superpole. Laverty secured ninth position on the grid. The air temperature rose to 30 degrees Celsius during the race, while the track temperature of 44 degrees was a little cooler than the previous week in Spain. Sykes did not make an ideal start and fell back to ninth place. Laverty was right behind him in tenth. Both were able to maintain a fast pace throughout the race and stayed in touch with the front runners. In the final stage of the race, Sykes closed in on the group battling for fifth place but he had no opportunity to overtake. Sykes finished eighth after 20 laps, three seconds behind the podium positions. Laverty crossed the line in tenth place shortly afterwards. Quotes after race one at Portimão. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “After unsatisfactory results at Jerez, we worked hard throughout the week, installing new parts and focusing on race performance. Yesterday, we were able to improve when testing over long distances and noticed that we are well positioned. Unfortunately, we had a small engine defect in this morning’s free practice – no engine damage so we can repair it. There was an oil leak which we will take a closer look at later. The team then did an outstanding job in preparing the motorcycle as it was before practice within an hour, including replacing the engine. Positions four and nine in Superpole were okay. You can see that Eugene is slowly getting on it. In the race, we unfortunately lost a few positions at the start, with Tom five positions in the first four corners. After that we were able to keep up with the group and over the race distance, our lap times have remained almost ‘atypically stable’ under these conditions. Unfortunately, we still have deficits in engine performance, which means that we can’t get past the other riders during the race. We would definitely have a chance, but we lose a few tenths per lap due to the engine and as a result we have almost no chance in the fight for positions. Our conclusion on the first day of racing was that it was definitely a huge improvement compared to Jerez, but we have to keep working hard to catch up with the leaders under these conditions. We will analyse the data now. Hopefully we can get off to a better start tomorrow. If both riders could slip from the top ten into the top eight, I would be happy for this weekend.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am pretty happy with this morning’s practice and Superpole. We got second and third row on the grid. There was potentially a little bit more left with both riders but we got be happy with the grid positions for race one. Overall we are satisfied with race one but at the same time there is a fair degree of frustration in there because we know what we are missing and once we have what we are missing, which is a little bit more of horsepower then clearly that regular podium is in sight. And that’s what’s holding us up in the moment. Both riders brought the bike home in solid positions but at the same time it’s what could have been and what can be. That sums up the race for our riders. They did not really put a step wrong. Tom was in the group that was battling for the third podium place until the latter part of the race. The results do not tell the efforts that is going into to get those results and sadly we have just fallen short of that podium place. It takes some more horsepower to propel us forward into that leading group and make passing more possible.” Tom Sykes: “To get P4 in qualifying today, I was a little disappointed, but realistically it was not a bad thing. Initially we had a good start, but as soon as I selected 2nd and 3rd gear into T1 we lost multiple track positions. We are still giving away some deficit in terms of horsepower, but if you look at sectors two and three, we are extracting good performance from the chassis on the BMW S 1000 RR. The only downside to the race was the fact that I had to ride the bike differently. I felt in the corner entry and in mid corners that I was being held up, which is fine, however it doesn’t allow me to carry the speed onto the straights as I am not able to sling shot out of the exits. I believe If we had the same engine performance as some of the competition we could have had great potential in that race.” Eugene Laverty: “The team in the garage worked really hard today due to the engine problem in the morning. There was actually a big question mark if we even could get into Superpole, so a big thanks to the team – the guys worked full gas, it was very close, but they made it in time. So the Superpole result today was the main thing after this morning and I was fine with it. Afterwards the race itself was hard, but okay for me. I lost a few positions at the start, had a good race in the middle, but lost the gap in the group in front. Tomorrow I will try to do another step and try to get the maximum out.” \n"}

The second race day of the Berlin finale (GER) to this season’s ABB FIA Formula E Championship was a disappointing one for BMW i Andretti Motorsport. Maximilian Günther (GER) and Alexander Sims (GBR) both suffered problems that resulted in them failing to pick up points in race seven of the season. The battery had to be replaced in Sims’ BMW iFE.20, which meant he had to start from the pit lane and received an additional drive-through penalty. Günther was running eighth when he damaged the front wing and a tyre in a battle with another car. By the time he emerged from the consequent pit stop, he found himself at the back of the field. Günther did initially continue, but subsequently retired. Sims came home in 19th place. Races three and four at Berlin-Tempelhof are scheduled for the weekend. Reactions to race 7 in Berlin: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport, team standings: 2nd place):“That was one of those days that you would like to rewind and start from the beginning again. It began badly, with the battery change on Alexander Sims’ car. We were then strong in practice, but unable to take that pace into qualifying. For Alexander, starting from the pit lane and the additional penalty meant his race was over before it even began. Maximilian Günther had a very good start and we were very promisingly positioned in the race. Unfortunately, there was then an incident with another car, which resulted in damage to the front wing and front-left tyre. We initially continued, to learn as much as possible for the coming races, but then called him back into the garage before the end of the race. We must use the time between now and the next race to analyse closely what we can do better.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, starting position: pit lane, race result: 19th place, points: 48, driver standings: 7th place):“Starting from the pit lane, and with a penalty, that was obviously a pretty lonely race. Our only chance would have been if a safety car had made an appearance but that didn’t happen. Generally speaking, we have to understand why we have good pace in practice, but are unable to maintain that in qualifying.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, starting position: 11th place, race result: DNF, points: 44, driver standings: 9th place):“The race started very well. I climbed three places and was then able to save some energy. I felt good in the car. Unfortunately, there was then an incident with Sam Bird. I hit the wall whilst battling with him and damaged the car. That is obviously disappointing, but these things unfortunately happen sometimes.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race.

The term ‘home race’ is used regularly in motorsport to describe an event taking place in the home country of a rider, team or manufacturer. However, when the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) visits ‘Autódromo Internacional do Algarve’ at Portimão (POR) this weekend , he headed home. From there, it takes him just a quarter of an hour to travel to the circuit each morning this weekend. “In the past, I’ve always considered Donington to be my home round, although it was in England, and to get there, my friends and family had to take a flight across the water”, said Laverty. “This time, as I moved to Portugal during the winter, the track is just 15 minutes from my home so it’s going to be unique. I will be able to stay in my own bed, have my normal breakfast and my coffee and then head off to work with my BMW R nineT or my BMW M4. That will be great and it’s the first time during my career that I will be able to do that.” Laverty is well acquainted with the ‘Autódromo Internacional do Algarve’ and knows what challenges await him, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the BMW S 1000 RR this weekend. The undulating track in the hilly hinterland of Portimão has its own very special features. “It has always been my favourite circuit”, Laverty explained. “It’s so natural with the undulations. It’s great fun, especially on a motorbike. When you’re braking into turn one from more than 300 km\/h, the braking point goes sharp downhill. Also great is Craig Jones Corner, where it is fourth gear, spinning the rear and on the exit it is completely blind so experience is so valuable at this track. It is not a track that you can learn instantly and I have more than a decade of experience there. I am hoping that this weekend I can benefit from that and get back on the podium.” Laverty is also a friend of Paulo Pinheiro, CEO of the ‘Autódromo Internacional do Algarve’. He knows that after WorldSBK, another highlight will follow later in the season: “2020 has been a really strange year for racing with all the series being stopped due to Covid-19 and there have been different circuits added to the calendar. And for Portimão that has been incredibly beneficial because now Formula One will be coming here at the end of October. It’s great and very exciting for the circuit. It has always been Paulo Pinheiro’s dream to have Formula One come to race on his circuit and finally in 2020 that becomes a reality.” Round three of the 2020 WorldSBK season at Portimão kicks off with two free practice sessions on Friday. They are followed on Saturday by another practice, Superpole qualifying and race one. Sunday features the warm-up, Superpole Race and race two. \n"}

Season 6 of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship kicked off its grand finale with the first of six races on the site of the former Berlin-Tempelhof Airport (GER). BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver Alexander Sims (GBR) finished ninth and picked up points in the Driver and Team competitions. Maximilian Günther (GER) came across the finish line in eighth place, but was subsequently disqualified for exceeding the amount of energy permitted during the race. The next race takes place on the same layout tomorrow (Thursday). Following a good show in practice in which Günther was third-fastest in the second session, the two BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers were lacking pace in qualifying. In the end, Günther started from 12th on the grid, with Sims having to settle for 16th place. In the race, the BMW i drivetrain once again demonstrated its excellent energy efficiency. While many other drivers were forced to save energy towards the end of the race, the BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers were able to gain a few places in the closing stages. The fightback resulted in eighth place for Günther and tenth for Sims, although Sims was then promoted a position following Günther’s disqualification. Victory in race six of the season went to championship leader António Félix da Costa (POR, DS Techeetah). Reactions to race 6 in Berlin: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport, team standings: 2nd place):“After what we saw in practice, we really thought we had a chance of making it into the Superpole in qualifying. Unfortunately, in hindsight, our strategy of two warm-up laps for the tyres was probably not ideal. When you then have to start quite a long way down the field, it is obviously difficult to battle through to the front in the race. Despite that, thanks to our efficient drivetrain, we were still initially able to achieve our goal for today of finishing in the top ten with both cars. We disputed Maximilian Günther’s disqualification intensely with the FIA, because we believe everything was okay, however we obviously accept the decision. From a sporting point of view, looking ahead to the coming races, we must take one or two steps forward to get where we want to be – on the podium.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, starting position: 16th place, race result: 9th place, points: 48, driver standings: 3rd place):“All in all, that was a tough day. It actually started well for me, with sixth place in the first practice session. Then we possibly went the wrong way a little with our set-up, and consequently lost some ground. Our speed was really good again in the race. Although the balance was not perfect, I was able to work my way into the top ten.

He also reveals what the team has been up to during the enforced break since the last race in Marrakesh (MAR) on 29th February. ->","completion":" Munich. The grand finale of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E Championship begins this week, with the former Berlin-Tempelhof Airport (GER) set to host six races in nine days. The packed schedule poses totally new challenges for BMW i Andretti Motorsport. In an interview, Team Principal Roger Griffiths explains what is required to enjoy success in Berlin. He also reveals what the team has been up to during the enforced break since the last race in Marrakesh (MAR) on 29th February. Roger, to give an overview, can you describe what happened since the team’s return from Marrakesh at the beginning of March? Roger Griffiths: “Despite the team being unable to physically work together we have been communicating effectively and therefore developing the BMW iFE.20 over the last four months. A significant amount of time has gone into developing our tools, procedures and processes. We have also been able to do a lot more in-depth analysis of our past performances and learn a lot from that.” How were you able to work in the last few months? Griffiths: “The team was already very adept at working remotely as that is really how we have been working for the last few seasons. With the Andretti engineering group spread around Europe and the USA and with the BMW engineers based in Munich we already had been effectively utilising conference calling, various communications apps and remote connectivity. So for us, it was really no change from the norm.” When did you get the equipment back after Marrakesh and what did you do with it? Griffiths: “The equipment came back in early June. We were concerned that the cars might be suffering from several months of being left unattended but I think we were fortunate with the condition we found them. The cars have been run up to confirm all was well initially, but then we have been able to completely rebuild them ready for the last races. We also took the opportunity to make some minor upgrades to the garage and also ensure we are COVID-19 compliant in terms of our future work environment.” What did the preparation for Berlin look like? Griffiths: “Really it is no different to any other race preparation. We have been looking at last season to see what we could improve, performing many simulations to make sure we have the best car configuration – at least for the one layout we know from last year.” Six races in nine days: what does that mean for you from a logistical perspective? Griffiths: “Logistically it is actually quite straight forward, not having to build and tear down the garage multiple times and transport the equipment and personnel. From a work load it will be tough as there is not much time between the various races so it will be key to make sure that we all minimise the amount of unnecessary work. Anyway, I think you will see a lot of tired faces by the end of the last race.” The limitations for personnel on site are very strict. How do you deal with it? Griffiths: “The FIA and Formula E have been very clear on the numbers and we have known for a little while that we will have to operate differently. In the end, it was all about damage limitation. We looked closely at what roles really couldn’t be done without physically being with the car and what ones could be done remotely without losing too much expertise on site. That really guided our decision as to who would be attending. Obviously, when you don’t have a crowd, media, sponsors and other guests then you don’t need to bring the staff to support that aspect. I know it is tough on some of the engineers and other staff as they are all racers and would really love to be with the team but this is the reality of what we have to do to be able to race in Berlin so we accept it.” Both drivers as well as the team are still in contention in the title race. What are your goals? Griffiths: “We are here to win races and championships. Both drivers are in strong positions in the championship and the team is only a few points off leading. We have been in contention all season and are certainly looking to try and reach that top step on the virtual podium by the end of the final race.” What will be key for a good finish of the season? Griffiths: “Firstly, finishing every race with both cars in the points, not making any mistakes, either on or off track and maximising the available track time for both drivers. All of the that starts with good and thorough preparation and that is where we are focusing right now.”\n"}

I think the track layout changes look exciting. They all look very different, so it certainly won’t feel like six races in the same place. Berlin was pretty good for us last year, so hopefully we will have a similar strong pace again and try to have some clean race days. Our main target has to be to score some good points and to fight for the title. I can’t wait.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20):“After the long break, I’m very excited to get back to racing – particularly in such a short space of time now, with six races in nine days. In Berlin, unfortunately not in front of a home crowd, but at least driving in my home country to finish the second half of the season is really special. We are really motivated after the long break. We’re also aware that we had a good first half of the season with strong results, but everything is starting from zero again now. I think that, as previously, we will try to focus only on ourselves and getting the best out of the car and us as a team. There will be some huge challenges, but we’re very well positioned, we used the past few months wisely and now I am just really looking forward to things starting up again.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race.

It was a day of mixed feelings for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP). The racetrack in the south of Spain hosted round two of the 2020 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Tom Sykes (GBR) finished sixth in Sunday morning’s Superpole Race. He then came home eleventh in race two in the afternoon. His team-mate Eugene Laverty (IRL) was 13th in the sprint race in the morning, but retired in race two. Conditions were hot again at Jerez de la Frontera on Sunday, with ambient temperatures of around 37 degrees Celsius and a track temperature of up to 60 degrees. Sykes started the morning’s Superpole Race from third place on his BMW S 1000 RR. He dropped three positions at the start and fell back into sixth place, before going on to finish in that position after ten laps of racing. Laverty made a quick start, racing through from eleventh into seventh place. He was running eighth at the halfway point, before he lost out in a fiercely-competitive group of riders and eventually crossed the finish line in 13th place. Sykes and Laverty then started race two from sixth and 13th places on Sunday afternoon. Sykes did not make a great start and conceded a few positions. Over the course of the race, he was unable to make any progress in a packed field and eventually finished eleventh. Laverty once again got off to a good start and climbed into the top-ten. Shortly after that, however, he hit a false neutral when changing gear and came off the track before rejoining the race at the back of the field. He ultimately had to retire in the second half of the race as he was also struggling with a painful blister on his foot. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team now heads straight to Portimão (POR), where round three of the 2020 WorldSBK season takes place next weekend. Quotes after race two at Jerez de la Frontera. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The day started pretty well. We were able to solve Saturday’s problems and finished the warm-up in decent positions. For the Superpole Race, we chose the harder SC0 tyre and that decision actually worked out quite well. We were very satisfied with Tom’s sixth place, which then was his start position for race two. Although we were able to make improvements with the bike, Eugene still did not get along with it as hoped, so he started race two from further down the grid. Sadly, we couldn’t shine in the second race. Tom was unfortunate in the first corners, which resulted in the loss of many positions that could not be made up during the race. Our pace was simply not good enough. Eugene hit a false neutral in turn thirteen when downshifting, was unable to stop and rode into the gravel. Unfortunately, the race was over for him from that point on. Now we have a week to work hard and analyse the problems and of course hope for significantly better results at Portimão.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It’s been a tough weekend. The Superpole Race for Tom wasn’t too bad to get P6. It was probably the best we could have afforded having opted for the SC0 instead of the SCX. For Eugene, on the other hand, the sprint race did not go to plan. In race two, Tom didn’t get a good start and got boxed in losing a lot of positions, which can happen. He was then in with a pack of riders where he just couldn’t make an impression on them due to major brake problems. The faster guys were five seconds up the road and you can run at their pace but when you’re stuck with riders with stronger motors than you, late on the brakes, it makes your race difficult. Eugene got a great start to his second race and gained around four positions into T1, but his race was short lived after hitting a false neutral and running into the gravel, ultimately ruining his race. He continued the race, however losing 30 seconds and riding with his blistered foot we made the decision to retire the bike. We will debrief with the riders tonight and have a detailed look at where we need to improve the bike for the next round in Portugal, hopefully coming back a lot stronger.” Tom Sykes: “I’m disappointed with today. We worked hard in the hot conditions but unfortunately not had the luck come our way. Yesterday we had some good pace in race one, but we had a technical issue which forced me to pit. Then today in the Superpole race, we opted for a tyre we knew was a harder compound and I think we had a decent race considering the difference in compounds. In race two we suffered more technical restrictions, but there are some positives to take away with us as we are constantly finding new areas to explore on the BMW S 1000 RR. Looking forward, I think we need some luck on our side so we can hopefully get the results that we deserve.” Eugene Laverty: “Another tough race today with a really good start. I fought aggressively and made up some positions within the first corners. Unfortunately, by the end of the first lap I got in this false neutral, ran off the track and from that point onwards my race was more or less over. I tried to do some laps to regain positions, but since I was outside the top twenty, I got to quit. So now I am focusing on Portimão, which was always one of my favourite races of the season but this year it’s even more special because it’s my first real home race, as I live just 15 minutes away from the track now. I expect the conditions will be nice and sunny and I am hoping for some strong results as I have won on the Portimao track several times, so let’s see what we do next weekend.”\n"}

Qualifying was a little better, and with Sheldon van der Linde we had a driver on one of the first two rows. The picture was a better one further down the grid too. In the race, we lost too much time in the first stint. We were simply unable to make up that ground in the second stint, even with a different strategy like the one we saw from Marco Wittmann, who came in a bit later for his tyre change. We struggled with tyre management again today. That is something we need to work on. The reliability and top speed were there, but the pace was not there in the first stint – particularly in sectors two and three. We have to analyse that. We must improve our package by the Lausitzring, although the tyres will not play such a major role there as they have done here at Spa. Congratulations to René Rast and Nico Müller.

We must now take a close look to see how we can improve for the Lausitzring.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 9th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 1 points):“That was all very sobering. In the end, I stopped late and perhaps picked up a point as a result. We must all take a very close look at the whole weekend. It is super-disappointing to finish 45 seconds behind the leader. That is not what we expect from ourselves, or what we were hoping for. You have to be honest and say that it was not a good performance from us. We have to work on that.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 7th, Race: 13th, Driver’s standings: 10th, 4 points):“That was not what we were hoping for. It is hard to understand, as the car felt good in qualifying but as soon as we line up for the race with more weight on board, it is too much for the tyres. They suffer too much. That is our main problem. It was not right, particularly in today’s second stint. I don’t know what was going on with the front-right tyre, but nothing was working. It did not have any grip, right from the word go, and I had a lot of understeer. I lost a lot of time. Nothing came together today. We must find out why. At the moment, I have no explanation.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 10th , Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 10 points):“My start was superb again. Generally speaking, I think that the first stint was also very strong, however I had to fight with a lot of cars. The tyres were done after that. All the same, I would describe the first stint as a good one. The second one definitely was not. That meant I was no longer able to set my sights on the cars ahead. I am still very happy and believe I have the potential. For now, we must keep fighting.” Bart Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“I believe our team got as much out of the race as possible in difficult conditions. We were unable to compete with Audi here at Spa, we have to admit that. Congratulations to them on their performance. Sheldon van der Linde showed good pace today, both in qualifying and the race. Unfortunately, Jonathan Aberdein lost a lot of time after a spin through no fault of his own, however he fought back magnificently. I am very happy with his performance. In the case of Philipp Eng, our tyre strategy did not work as well as yesterday.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 6th, Race: 11th, Drivers’ standings: 8th, 8 points):“That was very disappointing. Today was totally different to yesterday. We did not make any modifications to the car, we just used a different tyre. Yesterday I looked like the king of tyre management, today is a very different story. Nobody can understand that at the moment.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 11th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 3 points):“On the whole, the day was a little disappointing, but we definitely got something out of it. Unfortunately, I was spun at the start of the race, which cost us time. Thanks to our good pace and tyre management, we still managed to fight our way back into the race. In the end, we came away with ninth place. Given our grid position and the incident at the start, we can be satisfied with that result.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 4th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 9th, 8 points):“That was a good race for us. We got the maximum out of our package today. Unfortunately, we could do no more than that. I had a really good qualifying, perhaps one of the best laps I have ever driven. I am happy with myself today. After my problems in yesterday’s race, it was important for me to get my confidence back. I wanted to show what we are capable of. We did that. The Audis appear to be very quick. We will do everything we can to close the gap to them in the next race.”\n"}

The five-month break is over; the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) resumed this weekend with round two of the season at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. In Saturday’s Superpole, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team secured a place on the front row of the grid. However, a technical issue in race one meant the good start position went unrewarded. High temperatures are making the second race weekend in this season’s WorldSBK a real test for man and machine. On Saturday, temperatures reached 37 degrees Celsius in Jerez de la Frontera, with track temperatures approaching 60 degrees Celsius. In Saturday afternoon’s Superpole qualifying, Tom Sykes (GBR) landed his BMW S 1000 RR on the front row of the grid, in third place. The Brit narrowly missed out on pole position by just 0.04 seconds. His team-mate Eugene Laverty (IRL) was eleventh. However, Sykes’ challenge for a possible podium finish came to a premature end after three laps. Running fifth at the time, a technical issue initially forced him into the run-off zone and Sykes subsequently had to return to the pits. He was able to rejoin the race at the back of the field, but was not ultimately classified. Laverty gained several positions at the start, but then also ran into difficulties and dropped back through the field. He eventually crossed the finish line in 15th place after 20 laps of racing. Quotes after race one at Jerez de la Frontera. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “After a satisfying morning, during free practice three and qualifying, in which Tom was only four hundredths of a second behind the pole position, we unfortunately had to conclude the day with a disappointing race. After the last WorldSBK test at Barcelona, we arrived feeling very positive. Despite the Barcelona heat, we had good pace in our race distance simulations so we felt well prepared for the conditions here at Jerez so the top six was our target. Unfortunately, things turned out differently in the race. Tom had a problem with a gear sensor and Eugene had a problem with the front tyre. Currently we still have to find out the exact cause there. As a result, it was impossible for Eugene to ride at a highly inclined position. Now we are tackling these technical problems in order to be able to show tomorrow where we are.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Tom had a very strong Superpole this morning, putting his BMW S 1000 RR on the front row. Eugene struggled to get used to the qualifying tyre. As the race started, Tom got into a good rhythm and settled into the group well. Unfortunately on lap four we had a technical problem and had to return the bike to the pits. We managed to get Tom back out on track after fixing the issue which was crucial for us heading into tomorrow. Sadly we lost too much time doing this and only managed to get 16 laps in, which was deemed an unclassified position. We can only apologize to Tom for letting him down in this race, but we will come back stronger tomorrow. As for Eugene he really struggled throughout the race. He got a good start and gained a few positions off the line jumping up into P8 but then unfortunately he struggled with his front tyre from then on. It knocked the pace off his lap time and overall, his final position. This is nowhere near where Eugene wants to be and nor the team, but we will look at the data and hopefully do a better job in the remaining races.” Tom Sykes: “From the first free practice on, we tried to put together the perfect package for the race in these hot temperatures. The entire BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team did a good job on this so by the start of the race I felt really good and with our set-up we probably would had come a little bit stronger as the race progressed. But unfortunately we had a technical issue. The main thing was that the guys fixed it quickly, so I went back out. It was clear to see that in general, the set-up of the BMW S 1000 RR was well prepared, as immediately after being out again, I was back on my lap times and the bike itself was feeling good. For sure, I am a bit disappointed but we just have to try again tomorrow. Honestly speaking, if that issue had not happened we would have had chances for the podium so I am taking this momentum into tomorrow’s races.” Eugene Laverty: “We had a tough race today. I made it difficult for myself in qualifying starting in P11 but I managed to make a good start to the race and gained three positions. On lap two, I realised I was in trouble as I tried to brake into T1 and the bike just ran straight on, then again on T5, which was down to the front tyre not working. From then on it was a matter of learning the limits of the bike, which unfortunately was almost two seconds a lap slower than I expected. We need to investigate this issue as all weekend we have had not any problems with the front tyre until now in the race.”\n"}

The first of the nine events that make up the 2020 season is taking place this weekend at Spa-Francorchamps. The season-opener at the iconic Belgian circuit has not been an easy one so far for the BMW DTM teams. In the Saturday race, Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM) was the best-placed BMW driver in sixth.In hot, summery conditions, Eng was joined in the points by Lucas Auer (AUT, BMW Bank M4 DTM), Timo Glock (GER, iQOO BMW M4 DTM) and newcomer Jonathan Aberdein (RSA, CATL BMW M4 DTM) in positions seven, eight and ten. Marco Wittmann (GER) missed out on the top-ten, finishing eleventh in the Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) was particularly unlucky. Having qualified in fifth place as the best BMW driver in the morning, he was forced to return to the pits several times with a technical issue in the opening stages of the race. He was at least able to complete the race and crossed the finish line in 15th place. Victory went to Audi driver Nico Müller (SUI). Reactions to the 1st DTM race of the 2020 season at Spa-Francorchamps. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“First of all, it was nice to watch a DTM race live at the circuit again after such a long time. As we expected after the tests, tyre management across the full race distance was the big issue here. After a difficult qualifying, we tried to put what we had learned during the tests into practice. We saw with Philipp Eng and Lucas Auer that you can make progress in the race if you manage your tyres well. Unfortunately, not all the cars managed to do that. We must now take a very hard look and try to do better tomorrow. Congratulations to Nico Müller on a squeaky-clean race. Everyone behind him struggled with tyres. The key to success tomorrow will be getting a grip on this issue.” Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“Firstly, I would like to compliment my team on the end of the pre-season preparations. All in all, I think we did a good job. Unfortunately, we were lacking a bit of pace in qualifying. We must now find out why that was. We expected a drop in grip levels a little earlier in the race. The first stint went well. When the drop did come in the second stint, it was too late to come in and change the tyres. We have definitely learned a lot for tomorrow.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 8th, Race: 11th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 0 points):“The result is obviously disappointing. The first stint went well and I was able to work my way past my BMW colleagues. The tyres also felt good. Unfortunately, nothing went right in the second stint. So soon after the race, I cannot say what that was down to. We must analyse what happened.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 6th, Race: 8th, Driver’s standings: 9th, 4 points):“It is a shame that the result is not better, as I actually felt good in the car. I really looked after my tyres in the first stint and was perhaps even a little too conservative. The second stint was also going well until I overtook Marco Wittmann. After that, I suddenly had no grip on the rear axle. We must now see why that was.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 9th , Race: 7th, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 6 points):“I really enjoyed being back in a DTM car and at a race weekend. I am also very happy with my performance. After a two-year break and just two days of testing, finishing as the second-best BMW driver is a good result. I can also see that I still have a lot of room for improvement.” Bart Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“It was clear to us after the tests that the track is very aggressive on the tyres. On top of that, we also had extremely high temperatures today. As such, the challenge for the drivers was to manage the tyres in the race. Philipp Eng did that very well. He also used push-to-pass and DRS very cleverly. Unfortunately, we had a technical issue with Sheldon van der Linde. We repaired the car and sent him back out, despite being well behind, to allow him to learn as much as possible about the tyres. For Jonathan Aberdein, a top-ten finish on his debut in a BMW M4 DTM is a good result. Looking ahead to tomorrow, we will hopefully learn the right lessons and be closer to Audi.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 10th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 8 points):“When they shut the door on the grid, it was pure goosebumps. It is at moments like this that I know why I always wanted to be a racing driver. We discussed the race thoroughly in advance and prepared well. I would also like to thank Augusto Farfus, who gained valuable information regarding tyre management during the test. I did not quite find my rhythm in qualifying. That made us all the more determined to do well in the race and to pace ourselves well. We were the best BMW, but I obviously want to be the best out of everyone and for BMW to be out in front. We still have a bit of work ahead of us, but we’ll get there.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 13th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 1 points):“On the whole, it was not an easy race for any of the BMW drivers. Audi was in a league of its own today. For me, personally, the race was okay – not particularly eventful. I was able to look after my tyres, particularly in the second stint. In the end, I managed to pick up a point in tenth place. Generally speaking that is not a bad start, but I obviously want to keep improving.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 5th, Race: 15th, Drivers’ standings: 15th, 0 points):“I was very happy with my qualifying. I think I got the maximum out of the car. My start was also very good, but I suddenly had no power exiting Eau Rouge on lap two and had to come into the pits. We solved the problem and at least managed to gain some valuable experience with the tyres. That was the best we could hope for from this race.”\n"}

This weekend’s opening round will take place at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), a racetrack of which Team Principal Bart Mampaey has special memories. That is followed later in the season by October’s double-header at Zolder (BEL), where the team enjoyed success with all three drivers last year. In an interview, Mampaey talks about the 2020 DTM calendar with three events in Belgium, his family and team’s association with Spa-Francorchamps, which goes back decades, the spectacular first impression of the BMW M4 DTM at this iconic circuit, and his expectations ahead of the opening round and the rest of the season. Three of the nine rounds of the 2020 DTM season are held in Belgium. What does this mean to you? Bart Mampaey: “That is of course a nice bonus for our team. First of all, we have to congratulate ITR and DTM for making it possible to race this year. And apart from the special requirements that we need at the circuit it was also important to have a calendar which is as compact as possible. Compact also includes that the races are not held far away from the teams to travel. And in this respect having three rounds in Belgium is perfect for a Belgian team like us. Added to that, Spa is one of the best circuits in the world and Zolder proved last year that it is a fantastic track for DTM. It’s really great to have them on the calendar.” Especially the venue of the season-opener, Spa-Francorchamps, is a special place for you, your family and your team. What does Spa mean to BMW Team RBM? Mampaey: “Spa is a very important place in the history of my family and the race team which was formerly Juma Racing, my father and mother’s team. We have great memories of the 24 Hours of Spa those days, being very successful there from 1977 to 1984 with three victories and five second places, always with BMW and always being the best placed BMW. That was the first part of our history there. Then there was probably the biggest RBM victory at the race when the team started in 1997 with a double win in the Group N class, followed by another overall victory in 1998. And then of course Spa was also part of the FIA ETCC and the FIA WTCC calendars and between 2002 and 2010 we were successful there with Andy Priaulx. So Spa indeed is a very important place for the team, for the team’s history and for my family.” Now you are going to race there with the BMW M4 DTM. You tested there one day already, what did you learn? Mampaey: “First of all, it is nine years since we were on track there last time. In 2011 we did a test with the BMW Z4 GT3 there so going back there nine years later with the DTM car was great. The track was damp in the beginning but when it was possible to put the slicks on, I went down to Eau Rouge and shot a couple of videos of how the car went flat out through it, I think from as early as lap three onwards and that was very spectacular. The car with the downforce and lots of power as we have now in DTM, that’s fantastic around that track. I really enjoyed it. I also had three or four other spots where I could go to and watch the car going through the fast sequences of the circuit. With the high mileage we did it was a successful test and we are looking forward to racing there. It will probably not be so easy, I think following each other, DRS and Push-to-Pass will also have a big influence, so the test was important to prepare the event as well as possible. And from an emotional point of view it is always nice to be back there, having memories from a very young age and now seeing the DTM car there.” What do you think will be the biggest challenges for the DTM car at Spa? Mampaey: “We saw at the test that because the car has so much power and downforce, which makes it a fantastic beast to drive around the track, it also degrades the tyres very quickly. We need to find the correct balance for this race-track and for the conditions that we will experience at that weekend. And for sure there will be the challenge of following each other, using what we have in the car with DRS and Push-to-Pass in a way that we optimise the lap for qualifying and for the race. What we learned from the test is that for sure the tyre degradation over the distance of the race will be a challenge and we will be focusing on that.” Then the other Belgian circuit on the calendar is Zolder. Last year, DTM returned to that historic track and it was an unforgettable weekend for you… Mampaey: “Yes, last year it was the second round of the season. On Saturday, we celebrated the first victory with Philipp Eng. It was a double-podium, with Joel Eriksson finishing second. Then on Sunday we had the pole position with Sheldon van der Linde and Philipp claimed another strong result with second on the podium. So it was indeed a very good weekend for us. We just have to see how it will be this year. It is much later in the season; it is a double-header event in October, so the circumstances will be quite different, the championship will be already in its final phase then. We have to see where we are at that moment and hopefully we can be as successful as last year.” Does having three rounds in Belgium close to your team HQ at Mechelen make logistics and everything a bit easier for you? Mampaey: “I think the calendar will be a huge challenge by itself so it’s good that we don’t have to travel so far, for the mechanics, for the engineers and for the trucks. It makes the challenging calendar a little bit easier. I think that it will help us, also with the double headers that we have at the Lausitzring, the Nürburgring and at Zolder, but the season is still quite exceptional and the logistics will be quite a challenge. I expect that for the team and the team members it will be one of the hardest seasons that we ever had, for a long time not knowing exactly when we start and then to have nine race weekends within three months. It will be very hard and hopefully we can commit to the championship and hopefully we will have one or more drivers being on the podium so we get some positive momentum with us every time we travel back to Belgium, rebuild the car in the time we have and go to the next race prepared as best as we can.” So what are the team’s goals for the season? Mampaey: “We want to win the championship, as simple as that. We will do our best to enable our three drivers to challenge for the title when we come to the finale at Hockenheim. That is our goal.” \n"}

The two riders in the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Eugene Laverty (IRL), naturally spend a lot of time in the saddle of their BMW S 1000 RR. However, during tests and at race weekends in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), they also spend a lot of time sitting with their team in the garage between and during sessions. These meetings play an important role in development and set-up work. Sykes and Laverty must no longer forego the kind of comfort of their BMW M cars they have become accustomed to. Instead of standard chairs, they now have original BMW M sport seats in their pit areas – 100% made in Munich (GER) for use at racetracks in WorldSBK. The two seats used by Sykes and Laverty are optional equipment for the BMW M4 Competition, with high-class Merino leather covers. They weigh roughly 30 kilograms each. They were converted into chairs in the BMW Research Centre in Munich, by Alois Widbiller, Head of System Integration Seats, and his team. “We regularly make specials like this, so we suggested that we could also build special seats for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. We had great fun with the project,” explained Widbiller. It took him and his team roughly 60 working hours to convert the special model for the BMW M4 Competition into a garage seat. The task was to make a chair on rollers from a seat usually installed in a car. “That is really complex, as you cannot simply mount the seat on castors,” Widbiller explained. “For example, we had to design and produce special connecting pieces. They included an adapter, which we screw into the seat to form the connection with the rolling base. In the case of the rolling base, it was important to us that it sat nice and low to give both riders the most comfortable seating position possible. And the two chairs have obviously also been given a plaque with the words ‘BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’. It is located where the inside of the seat would be in a car. We had space there, and designed a special cover, on which we could mount the plaque.” Sykes and Laverty were presented with their new chairs by Dr. Markus Schramm. The Head of BMW Motorrad took the opportunity to wish them and the team a successful restart to the 2020 WorldSBK season. The two riders also used a trip to Munich to visit the BMW research centre, where they gained an impression of the prototype seats workshop and met Widbiller and his team. “It was very interesting for them to come to the place where parts are made for the cars. They don’t usually get to see areas like that,” said Widbiller. “It was excellent to welcome the two guys, and we obviously have our fingers crossed for a successful remainder of the season.” “People often underestimate how much time our riders actually spend sitting in the garage,” confirmed BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “This is particularly true during practice sessions. Before they take to the track, they prepare for their outings. Between runs they return to the garage and, while the crew works on the bike, the riders chat to their crew chiefs and engineers and give feedback on the bike. After all the sessions, including qualifying and the race, they head straight to the debrief with the team, in which all the details of how the bike responded in individual sections of the track are discussed and sector times are analysed. All that forms the basis for our set-up work during a race weekend. And the riders obviously also spend the final few minutes before they take to the grid in their garage, where they enter their final phase of concentration.” Thanks to their new BMW M chairs, they can now do this in ultimate comfort. \n"}

The Spanish city of Jerez de la Frontera now hosts round two of the season this weekend in the second week of July allowed the team to start its final preparations for the resumption of the season in similarly summery conditions as they can expect at the next two events. Quotes ahead of the events in Jerez and Portimão. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “After several months without racing, we are really looking forward to finally testing ourselves against our rivals out on the track again, and to offering our fans a double dose of eagerly-awaited motorsport – on television, at least. Jerez and Portimão are both great circuits, but are very different. We do have to work in restricted conditions, due to COVID-19, but we have prepared for this and are ready for the challenge. We also saw from MotoGP, which recently visited Jerez, that the expected heat will pose an additional challenge for man and machine. However, we are prepared, confident, and can hardly wait to get going again! We have made good use of the break in racing, even if not all the results of our development work are ready to be used at the next two events.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It is great to be back with round two of the 2020 WorldSBK. It seems so many months ago since we did the opening round in Australia. Since then, an awful lot of things have happened in the world and we have to respect the conditions we are working in. The safety and health of everyone have the highest priority for us. Regarding the racing aspects, we had two good tests at the Lausitzring and the ‘Circuit de Catalunya’ so we are optimistic that we are better prepared for the long race distance. Additionally, we know that the temperatures are going to be very high both at Jerez and Portimão, track and ambiance temperatures, so that is going to be a challenge for everybody. But we think that the successful work we did at Catalunya in the heat will put us in a good position for the races. Tom and Eugene both get a lot of testing laps completed and they have a good direction already of how they would like to start the Jerez weekend. Hopefully, both guys can qualify well, can take this into the races and come away with strong finishes. Both riders have a good experience with the BMW S 1000 RR at Jerez – Tom from last season and Eugene also from pre-season testing, so we should hit the ground running and we are hopeful that we can take on the fight.” Tom Sykes: “It is absolutely fantastic that finally the time has arrived after this very difficult period. We did some testing but racing is racing, so I am really happy to head into the double header, straight into things, at Jerez and Portimão. The characteristics of these tracks are really quite different, Jerez is pretty flowing and then Portimão up and down really considered a rollercoaster of a track, so we have certainly exciting but for sure also hot venues approaching. The target going into the weekend is to work on the bike set-up to ensure we have a good package on the BMW S 1000 RR for the warm conditions and go from there. The goal is always so achieve the maximum that we can as a team during the race weekend and to get the results that we can achieve together. I am really looking forward to getting back to racing and a big thanks goes to the organisers and all involved to manage to organise that calendar during this very difficult period.” Eugene Laverty: “Following on from a successful two-day test with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team earlier this month, I’m very excited about the upcoming races at Jerez and Portimão. The air temperature is going to be above 30°C making the asphalt quite slippery and smooth throttle control will be key. I’ve won races previously at Jerez and Portimão so I have fond memories of them both. The Portimão circuit is just fifteen minutes from where I live in Portugal so that will make it that bit more special for me. The five months’ pause from racing due to Covid-19 has given me a chance to re-energize and I’m very eager to get going again. A few months ago I really didn’t believe that we would return to racing at all in 2020, so compliments to Dorna for managing to get us back on track so swiftly.”\n"}

I think that we will have a lot of overtaking opportunities at Spa with the long straights and the DRS activations so that will definitively bring some close racing. I think it is still important to qualify well because you really need to run with the guys upfront if you want to have a good result at the end. I think we have a really strong car, we have made a lot of progress over the winter and we had a very good test with Augusto Farfus at Spa earlier this month so we are optimistic for a good result.” Note to editors. In the 2020 DTM season, our drivers will be available to talk to by means of virtual interviews during race weekends.

{"prompt":"In the 2020 DTM season, the grid will feature two BMW works drivers from South Africa: Sheldon van der Linde and Jonathan Aberdein. This is van der Linde’s second season at the wheel of the BMW M4 DTM. Aberdein, meanwhile, is contesting his first year as a works driver for the Munich-based manufacturer. The BMW brand can look back on a long history in South Africa, while both drivers have been fans of BMW since they were young boys. ->","completion":" Munich. When the 2020 DTM season gets underway next weekend won the World Championship title in the final Formula 1 race of the 1983 season at Kyalami, in the province of Gauteng. That was the first Formula 1 title for BMW and the first for a car with a turbo engine. Kyalami is also the racetrack, with which van der Linde associates his first memories of BMW. He comes from a family of racing drivers and his father Shaun used to drive BMW cars on the touring car scene. “I grew up next to the race track from I think four years old, watching my Dad race in a BMW at that time”, van der Linde remembered. “That was my first memory of BMW and that was where it kick-started. BMW stayed in my mind since then and that is why I always wanted to become a BMW driver one day, because I grew up with it and I think it was clear that I wanted to make the next step at some point in my life and also be like my Dad. He was my example and I obviously wanted to do what my Dad was doing.” Van der Linde achieved that goal in the 2019 season, when he joined the squad of BMW works drivers. Another dream came true for van der Linde last autumn when he contested a home race in South Africa as a BMW works driver. He raced in a BMW M6 GT3 for BMW Team Schnitzer at the finale of the 2019 Intercontinental GT Challenge at Kyalami. “I would have never expected to be in a BMW at Kyalami exactly like my Dad was long ago. For me, it was a very special event and one of my highlights of last year”, van der Linde said. “It was my first ever home race as a BMW works driver and just having all the home support from the fans and BMW South Africa was phenomenal. There are so many passionate BMW fans in South Africa and I had the feeling that we had the majority of the fans on our side.” The father of his new fellow BMW works driver, Aberdein, was also an active racing driver, maybe not in BMW race cars, but privately it was he who awakened his son’s enthusiasm for BMW when he was still but a boy. “One day, when I was still pretty young, I arrived home and there was a bright red BMW M3 E46 in the garage that my father had just bought”, Aberdein reflected. “And I thought that was by far the coolest thing I had ever seen in my life. That was a really, really high performance car and still now is one of my favourite BMWs.” Aberdein’s passion for the brand has never waned. “I’ve always liked all the BMW M3s and M4s that BMW have produced. And then, at the beginning of this year when I signed my first professional contract with BMW, that was a very, very special moment.” When the two South African BMW DTM drivers get the season underway at Spa-Francorchamps, they can be assured of the support of many of their compatriots. BMW is one of the most popular automobile brands in South Africa. “I myself have seen quite a few BMW and BMW M models on the road around Cape Town. They are a very popular choice for South Africans”, Aberdein confirmed. And van der Linde agreed: “The brand is very popular. Not only that people are enthusiastic when they see BMW at the racetrack. You also see so many BMW road cars on the road which is always a nice feeling because you are part of the brand and so many people have so much passion for the brand. For many years, BMW in South Africa has one of the highest market shares in M automobiles in the world. It’s a special feeling to be representing what so many people love in South Africa.” \n"}

The experience of luxurious driving pleasure has reached a whole new dimension in the BMW X7. The first Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) in the luxury segment combines a striking appearance with generous interior comfort combined with the brand’s hallmark sporty flair. An edition model now brings out the imposing presence and exclusive charisma of the BMW X7 in a particularly concentrated form. With its unique BMW Individual design and equipment features, the BMW X7 Edition Dark Shadow underlines both the sporty appearance and the luxury ambience of the largest SAV. The most striking feature of the edition model is the BMW Individual special paint finish in Frozen Arctic Grey metallic. This particularly high-quality and elaborate variant of the body finish is now used for the first time in a BMW X model. Additional selected variants of the special BMW Individual paint finish will be added to the range of optional equipment items for the BMW X7, BMW X6 and BMW X5 to coincide with the start of production of the edition model.The precisely coordinated details of the design and features for both exterior and interior give the BMW X7 edition model the status of a collector's item.

The edition model is available worldwide and can be combined with all engines offered for the BMW X7.The expressive paint finish of the BMW X7 Edition Dark Shadow is supplemented with the BMW Individual High Gloss Shadow Line including extended features. This means that in addition to the side window surrounds, the covers of the B and C columns and the exterior mirror bases, a black chrome finish is also featured on the frame and the bars of the BMW kidney grille, the Air Breathers and the tailpipe covers of the exhaust system. This creates a subtle contrast to the matt shimmering body surfaces, also emphasised by the BMW Individual Roof Rail High Gloss Shadow Line and the sun protection glazing. The dynamic character of the SAV is emphasised by the aerodynamically optimised bodywork elements of the M sports package, which also forms part of the equipment package for the edition model. Another exclusive feature of the BMW X7 Edition Dark Shadow is the 22-inch M light-alloy wheels in V-spoke design with a Jet Black matt finish and fitted with mixed tyres. The superior performance of the engine is accompanied by the emotionally powerful sound of the M sports exhaust system.An impressive combination of sporty flair and luxurious ambience also characterises the interior of the edition model, which is available with either six or seven seats. The driver and front passenger enjoy the superior sporty flair of the luxurious SAV on electrically adjustable comfort seats with memory function. An M leather steering wheel and BMW Individual equipment details specially developed for the BMW X7 Edition Dark Shadow bear witness to the very highest level of exclusivity.

The FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) may have been forced to take a break from racing for a few months, but work has continued where possible at BMW Motorrad Motorsport. In the wind tunnel, for example, engineers have been fine-tuning the aerodynamics of the BMW S 1000 RR in the BMW Group Acustic Wind Tunnel. An important role in this work is being played by BMW Motorrad World SBK Team rider, Eugene Laverty (IRL) – in the form of a 3D model. Aerodynamics play a key role in determining the top speed of a World Superbike. Even the smallest of details can make a big difference here. The goal is to keep the aerodynamic drag as low as possible. The BMW Group Acustic Wind Tunnel in Munich (GER) has everything the BMW Motorrad Motorsport engineers need to test and develop aerodynamic updates for the RR used in WorldSBK. However, to simulate the flow conditions as realistically as possible, it is not enough to simply position the bike in the wind tunnel by itself. Out on the racetrack, there is also a rider on the bike, creating his own air resistance, even if his riding position has also been optimised aerodynamically. For that reason, the whole package of motorcycle and rider is used in the airflow, which is generated by the wind tunnel’s 2,600-hp electric motor and can reach speeds of up to 255 km\/h. To make this possible, BMW Motorrad Motorsport has turned to an innovative method: 3D scanning. “Eugene was here in Munich with us before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. He was trying to find the ideal sitting position on the RR and, while he was in that position, we took detailed measurements with a 3D scanner,” said BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. Detailed measurements means every individual glove finger, every contour of the helmet, every seam in the leather overalls, every crease that affects the aerodynamic drag and with it the airflow. “Based on the data from the 3D scan, we created a plastic model made of two halves. It took about a week to get all the details right, however our 3D Eugene was then ready for action,” Bongers added. Since then, the plastic Laverty has been providing a very important service. He has racked up over 50 test runs in the wind tunnel. “Using a 3D model like this allows us to work more efficiently on development of our RR,” explains Bongers. “While a real rider must travel to get here, the plastic version is available at any time for testing in the wind tunnel. This means that we can evaluate and implement updates even faster.” Another major advantage of the 3D model became particularly apparent during the coronavirus-enforced break. While WorldSBK riders Laverty and Tom Sykes (GBR) were unable to travel to Munich due to travel restrictions, plastic Laverty was waiting in Munich, ready to get back on the RR in the wind tunnel. So, what does the real Laverty make of his double? “He’s just a few shades paler than my Irish complexion,” said a chuckling Laverty, referring to the light plastic used to make the model. “All joking aside, it was a little unusual to sit on the bike for so long and to be measured from every angle with a 3D scanner. However, the result is awesome. I can do my bit to make our RR faster without having to be in Munich in person. It’s not every day you get to see yourself as such a detailed model. It is fascinating what is possible with modern technology, and the BMW Group is leading the way in many areas in this regard.” Following the break for the coronavirus, it has now also been possible to measure team-mate Sykes in Munich. His 3D model will soon also see action in the wind tunnel. The next races for the optimised RR, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the real drivers will take place on the first weekend in August. The 2020 WorldSBK season, which was suspended after the opening round in Australia, will resume at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. \n"}

Roughly nine months have passed since Marco Wittmann (GER) last went racing in the Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM. The delayed start of the 2020 season is now just around the corner for the two-time DTM champion. In an interview, Wittmann talks about the long wait and his expectations of the coming 18 races. Marco, how much are you looking forward to finally getting the 2020 season underway in a few days? Marco Wittmann: “The anticipation ahead of finally climbing back into a race car and getting the season started is huge. The later start date is new to everyone and there is also a bit of regret that no fans will be allowed at the circuit. However, I believe we will have the support of the fans watching on television and we will obviously try to put on a really cool show for them. The season-opener at Spa is also new and rather special for us so we are really excited.” How has the enforced break, due to the pandemic, affected your pre-season preparations? Wittmann: “Preparations have obviously been a bit different. We had far more time to work on your fitness. The amount of stamina and strength training we did was huge and far greater than usual. Otherwise, we moved the team meetings back a little until we were allowed to meet up again. However, we also did a lot virtually in the meantime – things like Skype meetings, Zoom meetings, etc. That was obviously new territory for us all. It actually worked really well, even though I am not really a big fan of virtual stuff. I prefer to speak to people face to face.” Besides training, what have you been up to? Wittmann: “I still work in my father’s workshop, even during a normal season. Usually that is one or two days per week, when there are no appointments. The coronavirus situation meant that we had no motorsport appointments, so I actually ended up in the workshop every day. That was really cool, as it is still gives me a great balance and stopped me getting bored. We were fortunate that we never had to close the workshop and could, in principle, continue to work.” What did you learn last season? Wittmann: “I believe we primarily spent the winter working on the car, to wipe out the deficiencies we had in the 2019 season. The turbo engine was new to us all and we really struggled with it. We have, however, managed to get on top of the technical issues from last season. I then tried to work on myself – using data and videos from past races. I hope we are well-equipped and have taken a step forward. I think we are far more competitive than we were in 2019.” The season-opener at Spa throws up a two-day event on a track that is new to most of the drivers. How difficult will it be to go into qualifying on the back of just one practice session? Wittmann: “It is obviously an extremely compressed weekend, when everything has to run smoothly. The fact that we are racing at Spa for the first time in 15 years will make life a little bit difficult for everyone. Both BMW and Audi had the opportunity to test there for a day, with Augusto Farfus doing the driving for us. We gathered the first basic data there so we will travel to Spa with some sort of set-up already. However, we only have one practice session to change things, then it is straight into qualifying. As a driver, you have to find your feet quickly out on the track – but I like challenges like that. You don’t have a lot of time to think, because everything comes thick and fast and you just have to get everything right. I am looking forward to it.” This year, there will be a few back-to-back races. Will that suit you? Wittmann: “I am a fan of racing every weekend. It will be fascinating to see how that really works out when the season gets underway. I think back-to-back races are cool. You are really fired up and in stress mode. Let’s see how we feel after the final weekend (laughs), but it is obviously cool that, despite everything, we have managed to put together a calendar that still allows us to complete nearly all the races. I think that is very good news for the DTM and the fans, as well as for us drivers.” How important will experience be in this extraordinary season? Will it be an advantage for you and BMW Team RMG that you have worked together for so long? Wittmann: “It is always helpful to have an experienced team and to know each other well, then you already know how to get started and what set-up you need at many racetracks. I think the busy calendar will not make a big difference, as we will not have much time for analyses and everyone is ultimately in the same boat. When we have a double-header, as we will at the Lausitzring and Zolder, then you don’t have much time for reflection. You just have to go out and perform again. On top of that, you have the fact that we are racing on different layouts, which I personally find really cool. It is a bit like starting from scratch again the following weekend.” The current situation has forced the cancellation of the planned season-opener at the Norisring. How sorry were you to hear that decision? Wittmann: “It was an extremely bitter pill for me. I am in direct communication with the organisers, MCN (Motorsport Club Nürnberg), for whom it was really a herculean task. I tried to give a lot of input and to help, and I think we were well on the way to making the event possible. You have to consider that it is not a permanent racetrack, so it costs a lot to set up, for example. Eventually, the city of Nuremberg vetoed it. In these times, it goes without saying that safety has to take priority. Despite that, it was still a real shame for me personally, as it is my home race. A lot of love and emotion goes into that event.” Setting aside the absence of the Norisring this time, which circuits on the calendar are you most looking forward to? Wittmann: “Two, in fact. Obviously, the opener at Spa, because it is a super cool racetrack and I have driven there twice before – once with Formula BMW and in the BMW M6 GT3. The circuit has a mega history and is a typical old-school, natural racetrack. I am also looking forward to Assen, because that was my most successful weekend last year. It is a very cool racetrack with a great atmosphere and I really like the layout.” What are your goals for the 2020 season? Wittmann: “The ultimate goal is definitely to win the title. When you already have two titles, as I do, then you are never happy with second or third place. However, to be able to challenge for the title at the end of the year, we must first score some victories and podiums.”\n"}

Last Saturday’s rollout of the BMW M4 GT3 at the BMW Group plant in Dingolfing (GER) marked an important milestone in the development of the new BMW icon for the GT racing scene. After months of virtual work, BMW works driver Augusto Farfus (BRA) heralded the next phase of preparations, taking the new car out onto the streets for the first time. Despite facing many challenges, the BMW M4 GT3 has so far completed all the development steps according to plan and will travel to Miramas (FRA) for initial tests next week. Farfus rolled out of the garage at the wheel of the BMW M4 GT3 for the first time at 9:40hrs last Saturday and set about completing the first important function tests. The BMW Motorsport engineers spent the whole day putting the new GT car, which will replace the BMW M6 GT3 from the 2022 season, through its paces. The first tests are scheduled to take place on the track at the BMW Group’s test centre in the southern French commune of Miramas next week. “It is always an emotional moment when a newly-developed BMW race car takes to the track for the first time,” said Marquardt. “This time, however, I am particularly proud. Given the difficult conditions of the past few months, it is quite remarkable that we have managed to implement our development programme as planned, and whilst complying with the BMW Group’s strict safety and hygiene regulations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, have managed to stick to the date originally envisaged for the rollout of the BMW M4 GT3. I’d like to say a big thank you to everyone who has shown such commitment and the passion we have become accustomed to in the face of the extraordinary challenges faced in recent months, and who have overcome these challenges imperiously. Thanks to the very close and intensive collaboration with our colleagues at BMW M GmbH, we have been able to use the basis provided by the new BMW M4 production model to develop a race car that has everything it needs to continue the successful history of BMW Motorsport as a new GT icon.” Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH: “With every BMW M4, we are taking motor racing technology to the streets. That is particularly true of the new BMW M4 Coupé, which forms the perfect basis for the race car. The straight six-cylinder engine with M TwinPower turbo technology and high-rev concept is used in both the production car and the race car. Our engineers designed the power unit from the outset with performance characteristics derived straight from the world of motor racing. We are confident that this approach will pay dividends in terms of performance and driving pleasure for both our GT3 customer teams at the racetrack and for our customers who purchase a new BMW M4 or BMW M3.” The race car and production car were developed in parallel, and both are now in the midst of an intensive period of testing out on the track. The production versions of the new BMW M4 Coupé and the BMW M3 Limousine will be launched in September. The BMW M4 GT3 will contest its first races, for the purpose of testing under competitive conditions, in 2021 and will do battle for victory as the new BMW icon on the GT racing scene from the 2022 season. Between now and then, the BMW Motorsport engineers and BMW works drivers still have a lot of development and testing to do. “It was fantastic and a great honour for me to be able to drive the first few metres in the new BMW M4 GT3,” said Farfus after the rollout. “I have been involved in the development of several BMW race cars and am always particularly pleased to be a part of such an important project. Although our main job during the rollout is to perform functional tests, I had a good feeling in the car from the outset and am already looking forward to the tests scheduled for the coming months.” The rollout in Dingolfing was a milestone and a highlight of the development process, which began back at the start of 2019 with CFD computer simulations. The engine, generating more than 500 hp, took to the test stand in Munich in February, while initial tests were performed in the BMW Group wind tunnel from the middle of the year, using a 60-percent scale model of the car. The first test chassis of the BMW M4 GT3 was produced at the BMW Group plant in Regensburg (GER) in early 2020. After that, the test car used for the rollout was assembled within roughly six weeks in the BMW Motorsport workshop. Interested parties can contact BMW Motorsport about the BMW M4 GT3 by E-mail: M4GT3@BMW-Motorsport.com.\n"}

The team did a great job, the BMW S 1000 RR is amazing and we made a big step with the bike from the last race. It was a great test. All three of us riders set nearly the same lap-time, everyone is fast on a race simulation as well as on a qualifying lap. Now I am looking forward to the race at Le Mans. We are ready.” Markus Reiterberger: “We had a very comprehensive test programme with three riders on two bikes. The team had prepared that perfectly, and we were able to tick all boxes on our list. On the long runs, we focused on saving fuel and preserving the material. We also did a lot of tyre testing. Another point on the list was to work on a set-up for the 24-hour race that suits all three of us. Regarding lap times, we all three have been pretty fast. It was a great test and achieved a lot on these two days. I think that we are very well prepared. Our package is a good base for the Le Mans race weekend.” \n"}

Like every race series in the world, the DTM has been forced to react to the COVID-19 pandemic with a modified and far more compact race calendar. Starting with the season-opener at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) on 1st\/2nd August, the prospect of nine race weekends in a little over three months poses particular challenges to the teams and, in particular, their logistics operations. BMW Team RMG boss Stefan Reinhold explains what will be key during the season, and how his team is preparing for the extraordinary 2020 DTM season. Since the end of the official DTM tests, the DTM teams have been in the final phase of their preparations for the opening races, which will take place on 1st and 2nd August at ‘Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps’. At its headquarters in Andernach (GER), BMW Team RMG is busy assembling the three BMW M4 DTMs with which Marco Wittmann (GER), Timo Glock (GER) and Lucas Auer (AUT) will set their sights on victory at the pending nine race weekends. Within roughly three weeks, the three crews will again assemble their cars from scratch, checking every part, to ensure that nothing is left to chance ahead of what promises to be a tiring season. “With the new calendar, the races sometimes come in such quick succession that you must already be looking to keep the work between races to the bare minimum,” said Reinhold. Optimal preparation is the name of the game, including daily pit stop training in the team’s own workshop halls, as well as assembling the cars. However, even with so much work taking place, Reinhold still has one eye on the strain his employees could be under. As such, he has ensured that they used the relatively long time between the test and the opening races to take vacations and start the season as well-rested as possible – a season that promises to be particularly challenging, thanks mainly to its compact nature. Following the postponements of recent months, a season that would usually have run from April to October will now last just 15 weeks. The peak of this activity will be the six races on three consecutive weekends in September. To ensure that this workload can be managed, those responsible for the DTM have worked with the manufacturers to select venues that are, as a rule, relatively close to each other. “Short distances to the racetrack are essential. If we also had to cope with long journeys, then this race calendar would be impossible from a logistics point of view,” said Reinhold, going on to give an example: “To Monza, the trucks would be on the road for about two days. To Spa, Zolder or the Nürburgring it is no more than half a day’s journey. That makes a big difference to us, as travel time for material and personnel is always lost time that could be spent working on the car.” As well as the shortest possible distances between racetracks, the fact that the Lausitzring (GER), the Nürburgring (GER) and Zolder (BEL) will each host two back-to-back race weekends will also help relieve the strain on the teams. “Races at the same circuit will obviously help us greatly, as we can stay on site and continue to work on the cars. That way, we are able to save the time taken to set up and take down our equipment, and the transfer,” said Reinhold. The effort involved in setting up and dismantling equipment, in particular, should not be underestimated. BMW Team RMG takes four trucks holding a total of 30 tons of equipment to each race. That includes the three BMW M4 DTMs, as well as a host of spare parts, tools, wheels, superstructures for the pit wall, and workplaces for the engineers. It takes roughly two days to load all the trucks for a race weekend, travel to the circuit and unload the trucks there. Setting up the garages then takes another six to eight hours. In the weeks between the double-headers, the teams can stay at the circuit to perform the obligatory revisions that take place after each race weekend. This includes dismantling the BMW M4 DTM to check all the parts for wear and possible damage. The time available for this may be shorter than in a normal season, when the teams would have at least one weekend between races, but it is sufficient for the routine checks – provided everything has gone to plan on the previous race weekend. However, Reinhold always has one eye on possible additional challenges: “Avoiding any major damage will be particularly important this season, as time can become tight if you have to replace mechanical parts or many chassis parts.” Whatever happens, it is going to be an intensive time for BMW Team RMG and all the other DTM teams. However, Reinhold is in determined and confident mood. “The compact season is obviously going to be strenuous for the whole team. However, the current situation gives us no choice,” said Reinhold. “Despite the extraordinary circumstances, we are well prepared. The main thing is that we are able to go racing at all, as that’s ultimately why we are involved in motorsport.”\n"}

BMW M Customer Racing teams should actually have been in action around the world for a number of weeks already. However, the global coronavirus pandemic has meant a longer winter break than anticipated. In a new series, we report on how the BMW M Customer Racing teams have spent this enforced break and how they have prepared for the start of their racing series in these unusual times. Today we take a look at Stephen Cameron Racing from Sonoma (USA). The team was founded in 1987 and is led by team owner Stephen ‘Steve’ Cameron. Stephen Cameron Racing is located at Sonoma Raceway in California (USA) and competes with a BMW M4 GT4 in the GT4 America with Sean Quinlan (USA) in Sprint and with pro driver Greg Liefooghe (USA) as Pro-Am team in SprintX. Henry Schmitt (USA) and Liefooghe race with a BMW M6 GT3 in the Pro-Am category of the GT World Challenge America. In August a programme may start with the BMW M4 GT4 in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge. In an interview, team owner Cameron discusses the past few weeks, preparations, and the goals for this season. Mr Cameron, first and most important question: how are you and the team doing in these times? Stephen Cameron: “So far everybody on our team has been healthy. Actually as a precaution for this race weekend some of our team are staying in Sonoma and working remotely. I also made the decision to stay here just to be sure.” What effect, apart from the fact that you could not go racing, did the corona pandemic and associated restrictions have on your preparation work over the past months? Cameron: “We are based at Sonoma County at the racetrack Sonoma Raceway. They stopped I think in March when the Govenor locked-down and placed an order for California. As Sonoma falls under that order we were not able to use the track here. Two tracks opened up before Sonoma: Thunder Hill which is north of us and Buttonwillow south of us opened about a month ago for limited testing so we were able to start a test programme with the BMW M4 GT4. We had done a few days testing at both tracks with the car.” Did you start any new activities beside your usual racework? Cameron: “I did start a couple of new things still within racing. There was a group at Sonoma Raceway called The Turn 1 Club, a private driving club for members at Sonoma Raceway. That lockdown primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic and there was a change of ownership of the school and club at Sonoma Raceway. The members of the club started a new organisation at Thunder Hill Raceway and we were lucky to take over operating and maintaining and servicing a large group for those drivers. There are primarily a lot of Formula 3 cars and our Radicals. That allowed us to do something outside of the pro racing. That has been really valuable for us because it generated a new group of people to work with and a new income source.” The GT4 America and the GT World Challenge America will resume this weekend at the Virginia International Raceway. How much are you looking forward to finally go racing? Cameron: “We obviously are excited to go racing. It will be interesting with the new challenges of how things are done. For us, we won the championship last year in SprintX with Sean and Greg. We are excited to go out there and try to win that title again. Obviously for us that is the main goal.” Your home races at Sonoma Raceway are scheduled from 7th to 9th August. What is on your preparation schedule for those races and the weeks until then? Cameron: “Obviously there is still a concern in the county that something doesn’t change and we will go into lockdown. I know Sonoma is very nervous. For us, to be honest, the most difficult thing is trying to plan and make sure that we can do some testing and have these races. But unfortunately it’s not necessarily about what we are doing. It’s more about hoping that things get better and that the racetrack is able to maintain operations.” You race the BMW M4 GT4 and the BMW M6 GT3 – what are the strong points of these BMW M Customer Racing cars? Cameron: “The BMW M4 GT4 is a very driver friendly car. Greg is a Pro and Sean is the Am in our driver line-up, and the BMW M4 GT4 is still easy for the drivers to get confidence in the car. It doesn’t have a lot of characteristics to make it nervous; and is excellently balanced. There are some tracks where it’s particularly strong and where the BoP favours it. It definitely likes the bigger and faster tracks and is very strong at Watkins Glen and Road America. VIR is a really good track for it. BMW has done a good job in parts supply for the car. It’s good the way the system works with that. There are regular BMW dealers or motorsport dealers which are sourcing parts and having parts available. The BMW M6 GT3 – again I think it’s a relatively comfortable car to drive. Henry Schmitt has driven a lot of BMW race cars. The interesting thing he finds in driving the BMW M6 GT3 is that it is even better suited to his driving style than the BMW M4 GT4 because the downforce of the car is very, very good.” And let’s speak about your driver line-up: what are the strong points of your drivers? Cameron: “A lot comes down to the way they work. Greg is a very fast Pro and does a great job but he is an excellent driver coach as well. He is very skilled at working with his co-drivers. We work a lot with the data. All the drivers are very good at spending time analysing how they drive. They use the data a lot as far as trying to make sure they are optimising what they are doing in the car. One of the reasons for their performance level is that they are quite good for their experience. They are putting a lot of effort into the details of how they drive and how that impacts the way the car handles.” What makes the GT4 America and the GT World Challenge America special, attractive championships to compete in? Cameron: “At the GT4 America series the venues are very good and one of the things that attract the drivers. There is a good level of competition and quite a high number of cars in the series. That is attractive. At race weekends one of the things which is attractive for our drivers is that there is a lot of seat time. Especially in the BMW M4 GT4 Sean actually can run GT4 Sprint and GT4 SprintX on the same weekend. On an average weekend that’s giving him four races. In the situation now with some catch up events he can perhaps do six races at VIR. That is pretty attractive because realistically it doesn’t add that much to your budget but allows you a lot of racing and a lot of experience in a short period of time. I think in the GT3 series it’s the same thing with a lot of track time for the drivers.” So what are your goals for the season? Cameron: “In the GT4 we want to win the title, for sure. I think last year, with a tough championship, we had some breaks that were favourable for us. Last year the series was basically won on the last lap of the last race. It was an exciting championship. I think this year Sean is more experienced now but there is a lot of pressure on him. In his second year in GT4 he will handle the pressure and the stress of trying to win the championship a lot better. I’m hopeful after we had a little bit of an up and down last season that we will have more consistency in our results this year and a good chance of the title.”\n"}

The countdown is on to the restart of the 2020 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). After several months without racing, the season is set to resume on the first weekend in August at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP). In preparation for the coming races, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and its riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Eugene Laverty (IRL) took part in this week’s tests at the ‘Circuit de Catalunya’ near Barcelona (ESP). The test allowed the team to evaluate various updates for the BMW S 1000 RR, which have been worked upon during the enforced break since the season-opener in Australia. The fine-tuning primarily centred around finding the best possible basic set-up for round two of the season at Jerez de la Frontera. The team also used the test to familiarise itself with the ‘Circuit de Catalunya’ and to gain data on the track properties. That is particularly important, as the circuit to the north of Barcelona is new to the WorldSBK calendar in 2020. ‘Circuit de Catalunya’ will host the sixth event of the season from 18th to 20th September. Quotes after the test at the ‘Circuit de Catalunya’. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We can’t wait to go racing again after the long break we had since Australia. Testing at Barcelona was very beneficial in our preparation for the restart of the season. Conditions have been like we expect them to be at the next rounds we will have in Spain and Portugal. It was also great to get familiar with the ‘Circuit de Catalunya’ which we will race on for the first time in September. We now know a little bit more what to expect there. Now we are looking forward to Jerez and getting back to competition mode again.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We had some items to test and, very importantly, track familiarisation to get ready for the upcoming race later in the season. The updates that we had to test were mainly electronic strategy related and a lot of the other work that was focused on were race simulations runs and tyre wear in the latter stages of the race. I’m generally happy with both Tom and Eugene. It was very difficult to judge lap times overall with it being very cool in the morning and most were pushing for the times early on. Once the temperatures rose, we concentrated on the race runs. Overall we are happy, we’ve had a good test in Lausitz and here in Barcelona so now we can look forward to the restart of the WorldSBK Championship at Jerez.” Tom Sykes: “I’m feeling really good as we had a very productive test in Germany and have continued that same form here into Catalunya. It’s great to be here as I have never ridden the track so I’ve really enjoyed the layout of the whole circuit. We’ve had a good test schedule and worked through a lot of test items with the BMW S 1000 RR gathering some crucial information. It’s clear to see that the whole of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has been hard at work during this difficult period as we arrived here with a lot of ideas. It’s been working on different geometry settings, front and rear suspensions parameters, chassis options and we have certainly improved the electronic strategy. We are still exploring these set ups; we just need some time to put all this together.” Eugene Laverty: “This test has been my best run on the bike yet, it’s been fantastic and in particular my race run in that final session there. I did a race run yesterday which was a good pace, but I knew I had more to give today and I proved that. We lapped from the start in the 1’43.300’s and by lap 18 we were at 1’43.900, which was incredible compared to what a lot of the others lads were doing over the race distance. This morning I had some good pace on the ‘X’ tyre and then jumped to the ‘Q’ tyre but had a little crash. The crash was a similar crash to the one in Phillip Island which is something we need to look at. Overall I’m happy with the test and I’m looking forward to getting out in Jerez in a few weeks’ time.” \n"}

The official ITR test day took place on Thursday and offered the manufacturers in the DTM the opportunity to prepare for the challenging circuit, which has not welcomed DTM cars since 2005. As no current DTM drivers were permitted to attend the test, to ensure a level playing field, BMW works driver Augusto Farfus (BRA) returned to the wheel of the Shell BMW M4 DTM. Farfus, who took four victories and finished runner-up in the 2013 season before his DTM career drew to a close at the end of the 2018 season after 104 races, completed more than 130 laps of the seven-kilometre circuit. That amounted to a test workload of more than 900 kilometres. The main goal of the test was to discover how the BMW M4 DTM would behave on the demanding track and to gain valuable experience in preparation for the first race weekend on 1st\/2nd August. Following his return to the cockpit of a DTM car, Farfus, who contested the iconic 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps at the wheel of a BMW M6 GT3 in 2019, said: “It was a pleasure to drive the BMW M4 DTM again. I feel honoured and want to thank BMW Motorsport for choosing me as the driver for this test. It felt like yesterday that I did my last DTM race. After two laps I felt at home again in the BMW M4 DTM. The test was trouble free. I could do a lot of kilometres and think that we collected enough data to help the team.”\n"}

In a new series, we report on how the BMW M Customer Racing teams have spent this enforced break and how they have prepared for the start of their racing series in these unusual times. First up is Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport from Istanbul (TUR). The team was founded in 2008 by Borusan Otomotiv, the distributor of BMW in Turkey, with the aim to contribute to the development of motorsports in Turkey and to represent Turkey abroad. It is headed by Project Manager Hakan Tiftik, Team Director İbrahim Okyay, Team Manager Ahmet Köseleci and Team Coordinator Elif Tanca. Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport competes in the GT4 European Series and will enter two BMW M4 GT4s in the series in 2020.

In an interview, Team Manager Ahmet Köseleci discusses the past few weeks, preparations, and the goals for this season. Mr Köseleci, first and most important question: how are you and the team doing in these times? Ahmet Köseleci: “Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport, founded in 2008, has many branches as BOM Akademi for sharing our team’s experience with participants, BOM Karting for discovering and supporting young talents, and BOM E-Team to, again, discover talents and represent our country abroad, also in sim racing. In this period, while our preparations for the new season were going on, of course with some difficulties caused by the pandemic, for the first three organisations, BOM E-Team was surely going on restless. Beside our 2020 championship, we organised many online events as races and hotlaps. As a team we participated in championships and races, especially with the aim of fund raising for Covid-19 research.” What effect, apart from the fact that you could not go racing, did the corona pandemic and according restrictions have on your preparation work over the past months? Köseleci: “We were lucky enough to have problems only for international product deliveries. We also are thankful that no member of our team was infected by the virus, also thanks to the very severe restrictions dictated by the Turkish Government, as otherwise it would be impossible to get under control a city like İstanbul with almost 20 million citizens.” In what areas have you been able to work on over the past months? Köseleci: “Our team, in our carefully prepared and controlled workshop, continued to work on our cars, of course in restricted hours. All the members of our team, very busy racing since 13 years, have never had so much rest and never had time to get so bored!” The GT4 European Series will start on 25th July in Imola: How much are you looking forward to finally go racing? Köseleci: “We are used to start our season in March or April, so we really are looking forward to be on track again. Imola is one of our favourite tracks and we will be racing there for the seventh time, and we are very happy because it will be the first race of the season.” What is on your preparation schedule for the next weeks until then? Köseleci: “As the tracks in Turkey are not opened yet for the tests, we still were not able to go on track. In the workshop side we are ready.” You race the BMW M4 GT4 – what are the strong points of this BMW M Customer Racing car?Köseleci: “Until today we had and have raced with the BMW 320i, the BMW 320Si, the BMW 320TC, the BMW M3 GT4, the BMW Z4 GT3 and the BMW M4 GT4. The common point of all these cars is that they are all flawless, resistant and fast to win under every circumstance.” And let’s speak about your driver line-up: what are the strong points of your drivers? Köseleci: “Starting with the new driver of our team, Cem Bölükbaşı, 22 years old, who is a world ranked sim racer: he was able to be on the podium in his second real race in Misano last year and has been source of high enthusiasm and expectation. Then we have one of the youngest drivers of the team, Yağız Gedik, 26 years old: he competed in the 3 Hour Endurance Champions Cup in Italy in 2017, in the GT4 European Series in 2018 and in 2019, he was back to Turkish Championship and won the title. This year he is very willing and ready to race again in the GT4 European Series. Levent Kocabıyık is 35 years old and won the Turkish title twice. In 2016, he was one of the drivers of the team which won the 3 Hour Endurance Champions Cup in Italy, with the BMW Z4 GT3. He is one of the most experienced drivers of the team. Fatih Ayhan, 43 years, started his career in the USA with karting and was also one of the drivers of the team which won the 2016 3 Hour Endurance Champions Cup. He has been on the podium in many international races and is known as someone who always keeps a cool head. İbrahim Okyay, 50 years, is starting the 29th year of his driving career. He has raced and been on the podium in the FIA WTCC, the FIA ETCC, the 3 Hour Endurance Champions Cup and the GT4 European Series. In 2019, he was crowned Turkish Champion for the tenth time and he is the most experienced driver of the team.” What makes the GT4 European Series a special, attracting championship to compete in? Köseleci: “Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport is the only ‘all Turkish’ team participating in international races. We always prefer to be in competitive environments which give our team members more experience.” So what are your goals for the season? Köseleci: “We are following the full GT4 European Series for the third year in a row, and this will be the first time we will be competing with two cars. We want to be more competitive in the overall teams’ ranking.” \n"}

On Tuesday, drivers from BMW M Customer Racing teams had the opportunity to take to the track with sim racing pros at the first BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Track Day on the iRacing platform, and gain further experience in the discipline in the digital BMW M4 GT4. They received tuition from well-known ‘instructors’: BMW works driver Philipp Eng (AUT), who enjoys great success in the simulator himself, and the three sim racers Alexander Voß, Laurin Heinrich and Nils Koch (all GER). Those taking part from BMW M Customer Racing included Ben Tuck (GBR \/ Walkenhorst Motorsport), Daan Pijl (NED \/ MDM Motorsport) and Ben Green (GBR \/ FK Performance), as well as Jon Miller (USA \/ ST Racing) and Toby Grahovec (USA \/ Classic BMW) from the USA. The event also offered the opportunity for customer racers to have a close exchange and to prepare together for the coming races when they meet again at real racetracks. On the iRacing platform, entrants took to the virtual Grand Prix track at the Nürburgring. The race car was the BMW M4 GT4 in, inter alia, the yellow livery of BMW M Customer Racing Official Supplier M4 GT4, Ravenol. Race procedures were also simulated, with a free practice session, qualifying and a race. Instructors used a voice app to give the participants valuable tips on set-up work with digital race cars. “With their various commitments and activities, BMW has long demonstrated how seriously they take the field of sim racing,” said Eng. “This event showed that once again. I think it’s great that customer teams and drivers from the BMW Sports Trophy are also being given the opportunity to collaborate with sim experts.” “I was really happy to do the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing Track Day”, Green confirmed. “It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot from speaking to Philipp and the sim racers. It was great to see their set-ups and how they drive the car, which is slightly different in the simulation versus real life, so it was good to learn from their experience. Simulators are very important for me as I use them for practice tracks that I would not get the chance to test at, or at least to get up to speed before I go to the track in real life. I think it’s a very useful tool for that and I am spending more and more time on sim racing as it can train the mind in different ways and you can really benefit from it.” Meanwhile, the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing season is well underway. The next round of the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) took place on Wednesday. Victory on the rFactor2 platform went to Erhan Jajovski (MKD) from the R8G e-Sports Sim Racing Team. The BMW SIM 120 Cup then enters its next round on Sunday, when the best iRacing drivers will go head to head on the iconic Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) track. BMW Motorsport will stream Sunday’s BMW SIM 120 Cup live on its social media channels:Facebook: b.mw\/SIM120Cup_FB_R4YouTube: b.mw\/SIM120Cup_YT_R4Twitch: www.twitch.tv\/bmwmotorsport \n"}

Now the team and riders have been able to return to the track with the BMW S 1000 RR. Last week, Sykes and Laverty tested at Lausitzring (GER). Work at the team HQ in Guisborough (GBR) and at BMW Motorrad Motorsport in Munich (GER) was restricted during the break due to coronavirus protective measures. However, good use was made of the time, to analyse the findings and rider feedback from the season opener and to advance the development of the RR in many areas. Consequently the team had a whole host of new components and ideas with them for the test at the Lausitzring. In good weather conditions, the team had plenty of opportunity to test them out in preparation for the next races. The 2020 WorldSBK season will continue with the second race event of the year, at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) on the first weekend of August. Before that, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team will take part in further tests at Barcelona (ESP) on 8th and 9th July. Quotes after the test at the Lausitzring. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It was absolutely great to be back at the racetrack after such a long break. We had a very good test at the Lausitzring in consistent conditions and tested several new parts. We are very confident that we will be coming back stronger than we were before the break. We are looking forward to returning to racing at Jerez and show our competitiveness.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The test at the Lausitzring was the first time we had been back at the racetrack after the first round of the season in Australia, as in between we had been in lockdown with the coronavirus restrictions. We had great days of testing, the weather has been kind to us with very good conditions and we had the opportunity to test quite a lot of parts that we have been working on during the break. It has been very successful for both Tom and Eugene and we feel confident now that a lot of effort that the guys have been putting in at the factory will pay off now. We can look forward to another two days of testing at Barcelona in the first week of July.” Tom Sykes: “After such a long period off the bike with this tricky moment in time, it is an absolute pleasure to be here at the Lausitzring and back testing with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. It is fair to say that while everybody was stuck at home there has been a lot of work going on, certainly a lot of development, so this test has proved to be very vital. We certainly gathered a lot of information. It was good and it’s a great feeling to be back on the BMW S 1000 RR. Now we all are looking forward to returning to racing shortly.” Eugene Laverty: “We had a fantastic test at the Lausitzring. It was great to be back riding my BMW S 1000 RR after nearly four months off due to the pandemic but I am still getting to know that bike. It’s only the fourth track that I rode it on so it has been so beneficial to come here and ride it at the Lausitzring. We really benefitted from the track time in sunny conditions.

An international jury conducted its selection process unanimously and online. Leelee Chan was selected from a shortlist of three proposals by artists who are represented by galleries originally accepted into this year’s Art Basel show in Hong Kong. Leelee Chan is represented by Capsule Shanghai gallery.Leelee Chan’s BMW Art Journey “Tokens From Time” intends to trace material culture from the past, present and future. The artist will visit artisan families that practice ancient craftsmanship techniques using copper, silver and marble, among other materials, some of which play a role in the artist’s own sculptural practice. Along her journey, Chan will engage in dialogues with scientists and experts to understand how natural materials may be substituted by synthetic materials in the future.Investigating ancient materials and their future substitutes from the emerging fields of nanotechnology and biotechnology, Leelee Chan’s BMW Art Journey project gives expression to the evolving relationship between people and materials, and touches on contemporary debates surrounding ecological and cultural sustainability. Spanning from the hand-crafted to the industrial to the post-industrial, the artist's investigation of materials ultimately asks the question, “What does it mean to be a sculptor today?” In search of an answer, Leelee Chan plans to visit destinations in Europe, Japan and the Americas. Her final travel itinerary will be determined in observance of current travel and health regulations tied to the Covid-19 pandemic. “I am beyond excited to be selected for the BMW Art Journey. Material objects have always been at the core of my practice. The journey will allow me to dig much deeper by discovering new processes, by encountering the people who work with them in their everyday lives, and, thereby, to make them meaningful for me as a sculptor working in this current uncertain moment,” says Leelee Chan.The international jury consisted of Claire Hsu, Director, Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong; Matthias Mühling, Director, Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau, Munich; Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, President, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin; Philip Tinari, Director, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing; and Samson Young, artist and winner of the first BMW Art Journey. “Leelee Chan’s journey spans across time and space to consider the stories of materials, including metal, stone and crystals, and explore how they have shaped our human experience,” noted the Jury in its statement. “From ancient crystal caves in Mexico to marble workshops in Italy to high-tech synthetic quartz factories in Japan, the artist plans to investigate materials with the help of experts and craft practitioners, both as a source of raw material and as an inspiration for reflection. We were impressed by how Leelee Chan engages with materials that are charged with needs, values and ideas, to ask what it means to be a sculptor working today and tomorrow.”In addition to Leelee Chan, the shortlisted artists for the BMW Art Journey 2020 were: Jes Fan (represented by Empty Gallery, Hong Kong) and the artist duo Amy Lien & Enzo Camacho (represented by 47 Canal, New York).Launched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging artists worldwide. Now in its sixth year the initiative is evolving. Since 2020, the circle of eligible artists has been broadened. For the first time, eligible participants included not only emerging and mid-career artists from the Discoveries sector, but also artists presented by participating galleries founded no more than ten years ago. As this year's Art Basel show in Hong Kong had to be cancelled due to the outbreak and spread of Covid-19, the jury conducted its selection process online. Artists and their galleries were invited to submit digital applications, including a short video by the artists explaining their work and process.Past winners of the BMW Art Journey include sound and performance artist Samson Young (represented by a.m. Space, Hong Kong at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2015); video artists Henning Fehr and Philipp Rühr (represented by Galerie Max Mayer, Dusseldorf at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2015); Abigail Reynolds (represented by Rokeby, London at Art Basel's show in Hong Kong in 2016) as well as Max Hooper Schneider (represented by High Art, Paris at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2016), Astha Butail (represented by GALLERYSKE, New Dehli, Bangalore at Art Basel´s Hong Kong show in 2017), Jamal Cyrus (represented by Inman Gallery, Houston at Art Basel’s Miami Beach show in 2017), Zac Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland at Art Basel’s Hong Kong show in 2018) and Lu Yang (represented by the gallery Société, Berlin at Art Basel in Hong Kong 2019).BMW has supported Art Basel’s shows in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong Kong for many years.For further information and press material about the BMW Art Journey artists and their projects, please visit the new press section: www.bmw-art-journey.com\/press \n"}

From July 2020, new straight six-cylinder diesel engines will enhance both the supremacy and efficiency of numerous models of the BMW 7 Series. The comprehensively further developed power units boast improved performance and optimised efficiency. Moreover, they feature mild hybrid technology with a 48-volt starter generator. Thanks to a state-of-the-art exhaust aftertreatment system, all diesel models of the BMW 7 Series will in future comply with the Euro 6d emission standard. Furthermore, as from July 2020, the latest version of Integral Active Steering will be available for all model variants of the luxury sedan. Also, the range of special equipment will be supplemented by new exterior colours and high-quality options from BMW Individual.The diesel engines of the current generation are being offered in two performance levels. The power unit deployed in the models BMW 730d , BMW 730d xDrive , BMW 730Ld , BMW 730Ld xDrive impresses with an output increase of 15 kW\/21 hp to 210 kW\/286 hp, maximum torque having been raised by 30 to 650 Nm, which is available between 1,500 and 2,500 rpm. The exceptionally spontaneous power development is the result of further refined BMW TwinPower Turbo Technology, which now comprises two-stage supercharging with variable intake geometry. The Common Rail direct injection system has also been optimised and now delivers the fuel to the combustion chamber at a maximum pressure of 2,700 bar.The power increase provides the luxury sedans with even better acceleration in particular. For example, acceleration from 0 to 100 km\/h of both the BMW 730d and the BMW 730d xDrive has now improved by 0.2 seconds to 5.9 and 5.6 seconds respectively. This increase is accompanied by a fuel saving of up to 0.6 litres per 100 kilometres.The new generation of engine under the bonnet of the models BMW 740d xDrive and BMW 740Ld xDrive provides for enhanced performance as well as better fuel economy and emission levels. The maximum power output of the new straight six-cylinder diesel engine has increased by 15 kW\/20 hp to 250 kW\/340 hp. Maximum torque has risen by 20 Nm to 700 Nm and is available within the speed range of between 1,750 and 2,250 rpm. This engine also combines multi-stage turbocharging with the latest version of Common Rail direct injection technology. The turbocharging system features variable intake geometry in both the high- and low-pressure stages. This results in a higher tractive power which leads to a distinctive increase in performance. For example, the BMW 740d xDrive now sprints from 0 to 100 km\/h in 5.0 seconds, a gain of 0.2 seconds. At the same time, consumption has been lowered by 0.4 litres\/100 km.Both new power plants feature exhaust aftertreatment. The components located in the vicinity of the engine comprise a diesel oxidation particulate filter and an SCR coating on the diesel particulate filter. For optimum reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions a second dosage unit has been integrated at the outlet of the SCR fitted close to the engine. As a result, the new straight six-cylinder diesel engine powered models of the BMW 7 Series fulfil the Euro 6d emission standard.Even better acceleration and efficiency thanks to 48-volt mild hybrid technology.The mild hybrid technology used on the new diesel engine variants make an additional contribution towards spontaneous power delivery and better efficiency. It consists of a 48-volt starter generator facilitating particularly intensive brake energy recuperation, and an additional battery for storing the electricity generated in this way. The powerful starter generator can be used to both relieve and support the combustion engine. It produces an electric boost during acceleration. This immediately available additional power of 8 kW\/11 hp enhances the engine’s dynamic power delivery when starting off and during acceleration.Integral Active Steering with enhanced assistance when manoeuvring, new exterior colours and options from BMW Individual.Parallel to the introduction of the new straight six-cylinder engines, the latest version of Integral Active Steering will be available for all model variants of the BMW 7 Series as from July 2020. The optional suspension system combines a variable front axle transmission ratio with targeted active steering of the rear wheels. This ensures optimised agility and supremacy at higher speeds and comfort when manoeuvring. Even at particularly low speeds of less than 3 km\/h, the rear wheels are now countersteered. This further improves agility of the luxury sedan when entering and exiting parking spaces and when passing through narrow areas. The possibilities for individualisation of the exterior and interior are now even greater. The range of new exterior colours available for models of the BMW 7 Series will now include the variant Phytonic Blue metallic and the BMW Individual finish Frozen Bluestone metallic. It will also be possible in future to refine the luxurious ambience inside the car with the new version of the BMW Individual full-grain leather trim Merino in the colour combination Smokey White\/Night Blue\/Black and with the BMW Individual leather steering wheel.\n"}

After several months of working from home during the enforced break in racing, the BMW Junior Team is now set for its first race together. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) will drive a BMW M240i Racing at the opening round of this season’s Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS) on 27th June as they enter the next phase of their training. Last Monday, under the watchful eye of mentors Jochen Neerpasch and Dirk Adorf, the trio successfully passed the obligatory permit test ahead of its race debut on the Nordschleife (GER). Harper, Hesse and Verhagen each spent the past few months at home, but recently returned to Germany, where they moved back into their shared house near the Nürburgring. They will live and, above all, race together there for the full season. They got their first laps at the wheel of a BMW race car under their belt last Monday, at the permit test on the Nordschleife. They were accompanied by their mentors, Jochen Neerpasch and Dirk Adorf. The Juniors had previously learned all they needed to know about the track from their virtual starts in the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup and the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO. Now that the BMW Junior Team has acquired permission to race in the NLS, it will initially take to the track in a BMW M240i Racing when the season gets underway on 27th June. As soon as the Juniors have completed enough laps in this car, they will move on to the BMW M4 GT4, in which they will contest the 24-hour race in September. Provided everything goes to plan, they can then look forward to their first race outings in the BMW M6 GT3. “My first experience in the BMW M240i Racing on the Nordschleife was absolutely incredible,” said Verhagen. “When I went out for the first laps on what is by far the most technically demanding circuit I have ever experienced, I just thought ‘wow’. At the same time, however, it was immediately clear to me that this was my new favourite racetrack. On the whole, I am very happy to have the permit in the bag and am really looking forward to the first race.” Hesse said: “It felt great to finally get back behind the wheel of a race car. We got a lot of laps under our belt and were able to get to know the Nordschleife in both wet and dry conditions. Looking ahead to the race and the weather in the Eifel region, which is often unsettled, that will definitely be very helpful. Generally speaking, I am proud to be able to fly the BMW flag on the racetrack and to be a part of this team.” Harper is someone else who can hardly wait for his first race outing in the BMW M240i Racing. “After so many months without any races, the test really went rather well. It was fantastic to do the first few laps on the Nordschleife and to get the permit. That was our primary goal – and we achieved it. Next up is the first race which I am very much looking forward to.”\n"}

Like all motor racing teams, Andretti Autosport has been forced to take several months off racing. With the motorsport year now gradually picking speed again, team owner Michael Andretti has a number of intensive months ahead of him. Speaking in an interview, he discusses the enforced break, the BMW i Andretti Motorsport team and the development of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. Andretti also looks back at his early days as team owner and reveals his recipe for success. How does Andretti Autosport manage to get through these difficult times? Michael Andretti: “We’re very fortunate to have a strong and understanding staff and very supportive sponsors. I think this global crisis has put strains on every industry. It takes a shift of mindset – not just focusing on the bottom line, but looking at how we can be good partners, how we can support our communities and how we can all work together to come through this. If we can do that, we’ll all come through this stronger.” Do you personally miss being at the racetrack at the moment or is it perhaps even good to catch a break? Andretti: “It’s kind of a ‘careful what you wish for’ situation. When we are flat out in a normal schedule, it’s easy to think that you want a break. But then when you have a two or three-month break that is unplanned, all you want to do is be flat out! I think we are all looking forward to being back at a racetrack soon.” How busy do you expect the second half of the year to become? Andretti: “I think once things get back on track, it’s going to be busy. We have INDYCAR and Indy Lights starting back up in July, Supercars shortly thereafter, our GT4 team is looking at racing again and hopefully Formula E will also be right in line with the other series. Plus, we are gearing up for further projects in 2021 - so, while it seems slow now, it remains and will be busy.” For now, the races will be without spectators. What do you think about it? Andretti: “It’s disappointing, but we have to keep the safety of our fans and teams as top priority. It will feel very different not having everyone with us at the track, but we know they are there in spirit. Racing fans are some of the best fans in the world, I have no doubt they’ll stick with us.” When was the last time you drove a race car? Andretti: “I stopped racing competitively in 2007 but did get back into the INDYCAR two-seater for a celebrity ride in 2010. So, it’s been a little while - but I’m happily retired from driving and enjoying the ownership role now.” Would the race driver Michael Andretti have liked to drive an electric racecar like the BMW iFE.20? Andretti: “It’s hard to say. When I was at the height of my racing career, it was a different time and the thought of an all-electric race car would have seemed so far out there. Not sure anyone would have believed the concept. But the sport has evolved a lot. If I was still racing today? Never say never. I think it’d be at least worth a test day, for sure.” But you were convinced of the Formula E concept from the beginning, right? Andretti: “I’m convinced because new technology seems to be the trend of manufacturers for the future, as it such a great influence on the consumer world. It’s been really interesting being involved and helping to shape the future. We have been involved with Formula E from the beginning, and to see how far the tech has come in just a few years is really impressive.” Why did you decide to join the series from the word go? Andretti: “When we were presented with the opportunity in Season 1, we had hoped the series would grow into exactly what it has become. The competition is really strong, there’s great participation from manufacturers like BMW, and the fan base is impressive and growing each year. I think it’s important to stay diverse and continue to evolve as a race team, and Formula E has provided an opportunity for that over the past six seasons.” Looking at your Formula E partnership with BMW i Motorsport: How do you sum up season 5 and season 6 so far? Andretti: “I’m really proud of our partnership with BMW i Motorsport. I think in a short time, we’ve really come on strong to show how competitive and driven we are. Our collaboration is at the highest level. Both sides have come together to build one strong team, and we continue to motivate each other to keep driving forward. I can’t wait to get back to the racetrack and pick up where we left off.” What is your favourite Formula E venue and why? Andretti: “I am probably a little partial to the New York race, since it’s a home USA race for us.“ What other venues would you like to see in the race calendar? Andretti: “I’d love to see more of Formula E in the U.S. and North America. I think Miami and Long Beach were great events.” Like most other racing series Formula E has also discovered sim racing in the past months. What do you think about it? Andretti: “I think the sim racing gave us a great outlet to stay in front of fans and to provide some value to our sponsors, and it helped to keep drivers engaged. Will it be as popular when we go back to real racing? I’m not sure. But I do think there could still be a place for it from an entertainment focus, maybe in the offseason.” Andretti Autosport covers a wide range of motorsports categories. What’s the philosophy behind it? Andretti: “I think you have to stay diverse. Having the experiences and teams in different categories is part of what makes us competitive, and successful. It gives us platforms to grow our objectives, and to find the best talent and partners.” Being one of the most successful race drivers in North America, when and how did you decide to run your own team? Andretti: “I knew that I had a good career and I wanted that driving career to end on a high note, while I was still competitive. I didn’t want to just keep driving and fade away over time. I had an opportunity with the team I was driving for, Team Green, and 2003 seemed like the best time to make the transition. I bought into the team and retired from driving full-time that year, and things have grown and evolved to where we are today. Getting to this point required tenacity – you can’t give up when it gets tough. You have to keep an open mind and build a strong team around you. It takes good people. That’s what we have at Andretti Autosport.” How do you see the future of motorsport? Will it be electric or will there always be a community for combustion engine racing? Andretti: “That’s a question I don’t know the answer to. There may be combustion with alternate fuels, but we don’t know for sure. For me, I’m glad to be involved in both forms of racing.“\n"}

On Thursday, BMW works driver Bruno Spengler (CAN) celebrated his title win in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series, before delivering another victorious performance on Saturday. Together with Team BMW Bank and his team-mates Nils Koch and Kay Kaschube (both GER) on the virtual Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), Spengler secured a second victory in the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO. The trio won the sixth race of the season, the H&R 3-hour race, with the #107 BMW Z4 GT3. Spengler had finished seventh in qualifying for Saturday’s race. A perfect strategy, fast laps and a faultless performance saw Spengler, Koch and Kaschube improve steadily as the race progressed. The #107 BMW Z4 GT3 moved into the lead around 40 minutes from the end, claiming a comfortable victory by finishing 22 seconds ahead of the closest challenger. Team BMW Bank is the first crew to record two wins this season. Alongside Spengler, other BMW works drivers were also competing in the BMW Z4 GT3 once again: Martin Tomczyk, Jens Klingmann (both GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN), John Edwards (USA), Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR). In addition, the digital BMW M4 GT4 made its first appearance in the SP10 class. Five teams were competing with the car, including the BS+HYPE team with a familiar face; BMW works driver Timo Glock (GER) made his race debut on the Nordschleife in the #307 BMW M4 GT4. He shared driving duties with BMW Sports Trophy ‘Rookie of the Year’ Marius Zug (GER). On their first appearance together, the pair finished eleventh in their class. Reactions to the sixth race in the DNLS powered by VCO: Bruno Spengler: “I am delighted. After claiming the title in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series on Thursday, celebrating our second win in the DNLS powered by VCO with my team-mates from Team BMW Bank today is something special. It is great for me to have Nils Koch and Kay Kaschube as team-mates, as they are just fantastic and I can learn so much from them. The strategy today was the key to our success. It was very important to stay out of the traffic and the tyres deteriorated very quickly. We had a plan for me to drive seven laps, followed by seven for Nils and eight for Kay, and that worked perfectly. It was just as important to stay out of trouble and take extra care at the start and through the first turns, as that is where you can lose it all. Thanks to both guys, they were super-fast, super-consistent, and it is a great result. It was a great Saturday.” Timo Glock: “My race debut on the Nordschleife was a lot of fun. I did have to get used to the BMW M4 GT4 to start with, as I had been testing with the – real – BMW M4 DTM on the Nürburgring last week. You notice the difference in downforce even in the simulation. I was really happy, considering that that was my first appearance on the Nordschleife. I left the car in one piece and got through my stint well. Marius Zug was behind the wheel for qualifying, the start and the final stint. I did make his life a bit difficult as I kept failing to notice that I had gone outside the track limits, which is why he was subjected to a drive-through penalty. Nonetheless, it was great fun and really cool. I am looking forward to maybe getting another chance to drive in a race like this.” \n"}

The virtual BMW M4 GT4 celebrated a successful debut in an official sim racing event at the IMSA iRacing Challenge Series race in the same location. Spengler endured a tumultuous start to the season finale in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series. Starting from eighth place, he was hit by another car at the start of lap one. This serious accident caused severe damage to his virtual BMW M8 GTE and he was forced to make an extended repair stop. It was then clear that he had no chance of making his way back to the front and would post his non-scoring result for the season in Watkins Glen. After a strong chasing performance, he crossed the line in 14th position. Catsburg would have had to win the race to come out on top in the battle for the title within BMW. He displayed plenty of fighting spirit but could not improve on fourth place. This result confirmed his second place in the overall standings. Victory went to Rodrigo Pflucker (PER, Ford), while John Edwards (USA) finished third to reach the podium for BMW. A total of five BMW M8 GTEs made it into in the top 10. Turner Motorsport driver Robby Foley (USA) and the two BMW Team RLL drivers Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) claimed fifth, sixth and eighth positions. Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW M8 GTE, BMW IMSA Team Red, Champion): “I am delighted to have won this title.

Many thanks to everyone who supported me, and thanks to IMSA management for organising this virtual race series for us, the drivers, and the fans in these testing times. It was fantastic and so much fun. Today’s race was full of emotion. After the accident on the first lap, I was unbelievably disappointed and could only think ‘That’s blown my title chances.’ But slowly, it became clear that I would still do it, as Nicky was unable to win the race.

BMW M Motorsport is back on the racetrack as the BMW DTM teams took part in the official ITR test days at the Nürburgring (GER) from Monday to Thursday. These had been scheduled to take place in mid-March but the global Coronavirus pandemic forced their postponement. Now it was time for the wheels of the BMW M4 DTMs to turn again. The six BMW DTM works drivers and their teams, BMW Team RBM and BMW Team RMG, had the opportunity to prepare for the start of the 2020 DTM season. To allow these tests to take place, a comprehensive hygiene concept was put in place to ensure the necessary safety of all participants in the paddock and on the circuit. BMW M Motorsport had started preparations for 2020 by working on reliability over the winter. The progress made in this area had already been confirmed at the test at Vallelunga (ITA) in mid-February. The focus therefore shifted to the performance of the BMW M4 DTM at the Nürburgring. The test also gave the two new BMW DTM drivers Lucas Auer (AUT) and Jonathan Aberdein (RSA) the chance to familiarise themselves with the BMW M4 DTM. Together with Marco Wittmann (GER), Timo Glock (GER), Philipp Eng (AUT) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), they shared driving duties on the four days of testing. In total, the six BMW DTM works drivers completed 1,725 laps or 6,260 kilometres of testing during the Nürburgring tests. The 2020 DTM season starts on 1st and 2nd August at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium. Reactions to the DTM tests at the Nürburgring: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“The past few months have been really difficult for all of us. This was a situation that no one among us has ever experienced before, neither in private nor in professional life. That is why it is great that all the safety measures have allowed us to return to the racetrack with the DTM tests at the Nürburgring. A big thank you to ITR for making this possible with their safety concept. Guaranteeing the safety and health of everyone is the top priority and the ITR and all participants have done a great job in that respect. It is fantastic to hear the sound of the engines again and to see how the drivers and teams are working – even though the way we work is very different to how it used to be, but we have got used to this very quickly. A certain normality is returning to proceedings, albeit a very different one. However, we are back and we are looking forward all the more to the start of the season at Spa-Francorchamps in August. We’ve still got some work to do beforehand but I think that we are on the right track. We are hoping to provide great race action on TV and streaming for the fans, who have also had to wait a long time.” Stefan Reinhold, Team Principal BMW Team RMG:“It is superb that we have been able to return to the racetrack. We enjoyed it more and more as the testing progressed, as we could see how well we had prepared before coming here. We were able to make maximum use of the four days of testing and all three drivers were very pleased. Timo Glock and Marco Wittmann recorded some super-fast times and our new driver Lucas Auer felt right at home on day one. He is already working really well with his engineers. Of course, we have adapted our operating procedures to take the hygiene requirements into account but these regulations were necessary and good. We prepared carefully for these new measures, including new seating arrangements in the trucks and in the garage. The whole team deserves plenty of praise for implementing everything so well. From a sporting perspective, we feel that we have prepared well. We worked through plenty of testing points and we are ready for the first race.” Bart Mampaey, Team Principal BMW Team RBM:“Keeping everyone healthy is the most important thing and it was good to see that this hygiene concept allowed us to return to the racetrack. The rules and regulations were easy to implement and did not hamper our testing in any way. It’s been a long time since we were last at the track with our BMW M4 DTMs, so I am particularly pleased for the entire team that we are now able to return. The tests went excellently; we completed plenty of laps and made it through our programme well. It’s going to be interesting as we could see how close together the whole field is. We are ready and we are looking forward to the start of the season. It’s great that we have three race weekends in Belgium, and having Spa on the calendar is a personal highlight for me. We can hardly wait to make our appearance there.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG):“It was great to finally be back in the car. This ITR test means that we can see light at the end of the tunnel again after this relatively long break, and now we are looking forward to the season-opener even more. Of course, there are new features for us to work with, such as having to wear masks, but I think we were able to implement everything very well. It was fantastic to get back on the racetrack with the BMW M4 DTM and complete some laps. We were able to work through a comprehensive test programme and prepare well for the season. I am very optimistic and I think that we took some important steps in the winter, which will help us progress. I am already excited about the season-opener in Spa-Francorchamps. We would like to put on a great show for the fans, even if they can’t be there in person. I am sure that we can entertain them on TV, as DTM racing has always been great and I think that it will be even better this year.” Timo Glock (#16 iQOO BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG):“I was really looking forward to getting back into the car – especially in my BMW M4 DTM, as the design is just marvellous. We had some good test days here and worked through our programme really well. I am very pleased, it felt good and it was a productive test. Everything went perfectly. We had every type of weather too, and it even rained briefly as well. It was good to also be able to drive in the rain for a bit. I am happy and I am looking forward to the season-opener. Especially so, as we are starting the season in Spa-Francorchamps. This circuit is always special, and it will be a real highlight with the DTM car.” Lucas Auer (#22 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR):“The test went really well. We drove plenty of kilometres and we collected a lot of data. For me, the first day was all about getting used to the DTM again. After that, we concentrated on what suits me and what doesn’t. The team and I are already working excellently together; it didn’t take us long to find our rhythm. I really like the BMW M4 DTM. Generally speaking, the DTM cars with the turbo engines have now more horsepower than I know from earlier years and they are great fun. Overall, the testing went well and now we have to build on that at Spa.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM):“It was cool to be driving again. That was a successful test; we did plenty of homework and worked through our programme. Above all, it was marvellous to be back at the racetrack with a whiff of petrol in the air, and to see my team again. Thanks to everyone involved in working out the hygiene measures and ensuring that we were able to hold these test days at all. Now I feel like I am well prepared for the season-opener at Spa. Of course, we have to review and analyse the tests but I am very confident about the first race.” Jonathan Aberdein (#27 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR):“It’s incredible to be back in the car after so long. I think everyone is thankful to be able to be at the race track again. The test has been very successful for us. We’ve made good steps on the car and for me personally, I just familiarised myself with the BMW M4 DTM pretty quickly. I love the BMW M4 DTM, I think it’s the coolest looking car on the grid and – most important – it is really great to drive. I am feeling confident and am looking forward to the first races.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM):“It has been a very positive test. I was able to complete a lot of laps on the two days I have been in action and of course I am very happy about that. The reliability seems to be a lot stronger than last year, the car is performing really well and the guys have done an amazing job over the winter. I feel super comfortable in the car and am very happy with my test days, especially with Wednesday when I was only missing on tenth of a second to the best time of the day. I am satisfied with my long run performances as well as with my short runs. Of course we will only see how competitive we are when we are having the first races of the season at Spa-Francorchamps but I am sure that the guys have done a great job so I am really confident.” \n"}

The corona situation continues to have a worldwide impact. But it should not be forgotten that there are other issues that concern people. In Australia, for example, these are the effects of the devastating bushfires that can still be felt today and will continue to do so. Directly after the 2020 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) season opener, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team with riders, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Eugene Laverty (IRL), BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers and Team Principal Shaun Muir got their own impressions of the damages and met with residents and firefighters affected by the crisis. These were inspiring and emotional encounters. The three-day tour is now documented in a video. One day after the first race weekend of the season at Phillip Island (AUS), the members of the BMW Motorrad World SBK Team assembled again at the circuit. This time, however, they did not mount the BMW S 1000 RR, but BMW GS motorcycles. This is because they were setting off on a rather special off-road tour, starting out from Phillip Island Circuit that led them through the areas affected by the recent bush fires for three days. The tour was organised by BMW Group Australia as part of its extensive bushfire relief efforts. For months, Australia was afflicted by devastating bushfires, as a result of which countless people lost their homes, while the fauna and flora suffered massive damage. The initiatives by BMW Group Australia included the donation of 600,000 AUD to the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery appeal – which supports evacuation centres and recovery hubs - and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the most influential independent conservation organisation in the world. As the opening round of WorldSBK traditionally takes place in Australia, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had decided to team up with BMW Group Australia and do its bit. They did so by swapping the RR for GS motorcycles, gaining a picture of the situation, and meeting the people affected and firefighters on site, who fought for months to prevent the catastrophe. 1,200 kilometres from Phillip Island to Canberra. The tour started from Phillip Island and led the riders 1,200 kilometres through the southeast of Australia to the capital Canberra. Significantly, the route incorporated sections of the iconic GS Safari, in which BMW Group Australia has played a key role for several years with both a charity focus and provision of heightened experiences for BMW customers. On the Monday morning after the WorldSBK season-opener, the time had come to get going. Sykes, Laverty, Bongers and Muir assembled at Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit, where they met up with fellow riders who would be joining them on the tour. They included BMW Group Australia instructors, like Glenn Allerton (AUS), who rides an RR in the Australian Superbike Championship (ASBK). “It was important for us to do this tour,” says Bongers. “The images of the bush fires were all over the media. However, you can only truly grasp the size and the impact when you are actually there.” They headed cross-country through the state of Victoria to Bright and to the small community of Swifts Creek, both of which were heavily impacted by bushfires. The route then led them through the Alpine National Park, to the state of New South Wales and on to their final destination in Canberra. “We started at the racetrack, but our thoughts were soon turned on their head after just a few metres,” says Sykes. “I left the racing behind me. Obviously riding the BMW R 1250 GS Adventure was incredible fun and a great way to relax after a race weekend, but what we saw next was really quite unbelievable.” For example, the effects of the impact on nature: “The contrasts were clear to see. In the unaffected areas, you could see how it used to be: mile after mile of beautiful countryside with a unique flora and so many animals, from kangaroos, emus, koalas and deer to snakes. Australia is such a biodiverse country and it was awful to see how this had been destroyed by the fires. On the other hand you also then get a feeling of hope when you come to areas, in which new plants, like eucalyptus trees, are rising out of the burnt ashes.” Meeting the firefighters of Swifts Creek. The visit to the firefighters in the small community of Swifts Creek, with a population of just 250, was particularly emotional. The firefighters demonstrated their equipment, including how a fire engine’s protective mechanism works when surrounded by an inferno. Laverty and Sykes tried on the jackets and helmets, which the firefighters had worn whilst battling the bush fires in the previous months. The firefighters and residents discussed at length how they experienced the catastrophe – and why, despite the sheer adversity, they refuse to give up and always move forward. “We had some comprehensive chats and could feel how sincerely happy the people of Swifts Creek were that we made the effort to visit them after the race weekend, to show and express our appreciation. At the same time, talking to the people who overcame this catastrophe were inspirational for us,” says Bongers. Muir adds: “We were overwhelmed by the welcome we received in Swifts Creek. Those people had been through so much in the previous months. We visited them to acknowledge them and show them our respect. They were very grateful – and we were also able to take a lot from our time there.” In Swifts Creek, the four riders found themselves in the midst of a remarkable story. One of the volunteer firefighters there is Charles Leggett, a huge motorsport fan who himself used to race. Once the bush fires had died down, he was able to watch the opening round of WorldSBK live on Phillip Island, as he does every year. “I have just come from a campsite on Phillip Island, where I followed how Eugene, Tom and the rest of the team got on in the opening races,” said Leggett. “And how fantastic is this? First I watched the races on the weekend, and now I am meeting everyone in person here in our little fire station! Tom Sykes is wearing my firefighter jacket, in which I battled against the bushfires. I am incredibly proud. I would like to thank the whole team for visiting – it has been a special day for us all, and especially for me.” Never give up and always look forward. The charity tour reached its destination in Canberra on Wednesday evening. After 1,200 kilometres of cross-country riding, everyone was rather exhausted but deeply moved by what they had seen and experienced. “The whole trip was inspiring but, above all, meeting the people was particularly moving,” says Laverty, speaking on behalf of everyone. “The people were genuinely pleased that we had visited them. And it was a pleasure for us to be able to give them that joy. The Australians’ spirit, which you could feel in all our meetings with the residents, was particularly inspirational: Never give up, fight to the last, and always look forward. That is something we have all taken from this experience.” Vikram Pawah, CEO of BMW Group Australia, said the visit of international BMW Motorrad Motorsport identities to bushfire-affected regions was a fillip and that it perfectly complemented local efforts to provide aid to those in need. “We were heartened to see the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team literally go the extra mile straight after the first races of the season to immerse themselves in the impacted areas and provide a very welcome boost to those who battled so hard through that dreadful situation during the fires,” Pawah said. “The fact that Tom, Eugene, Marc and Shaun did not hesitate for a second when deciding to do this tour shows that they share our spirit and sincere desire to be part of the extensive relief efforts.” BMW Group Australia has plans in place to continue raising funds for bushfire victims including the auctioning of the BMW GS helmets worn by Sykes and Laverty during the tour for charity. The video documenting the joint charity off-road tour which the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team undertook with BMW Group Australia can be found online at the following link: https:\/\/b.mw\/motorrad_charity_tour \n"}

If someone had said to me at the beginning of the year that I would contest a virtual IMSA series against many of my real-life driver colleagues and would be leading the championship going into the season finale, or that I would compete in races at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife alongside professional sim racers and would even win, I would have said ‘Yeah, right!” How important is a virtual title win to you? Spengler: “I would be delighted, because success in a series with such a strong field is of great significance to us as racing drivers. I’m very ambitious and want to be really good at everything I do. I’ve spent a corresponding number of hours practicing over the past months. I gave it my all from the very first race to be successful in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series. It has worked really well so far, but just like in real-life racing anything can happen. I might end up standing still in the first turn on the final race and losing everything so I’m keeping both feet on the ground.” Bruno Spengler and sim racing: How did it start? Spengler: “I first came into contact with professional sim racing at the ADAC SimRacing Expo last September. Before that I had raced now and again for fun, but it wasn’t until the expo that I saw the extremely high level at which it is possible to be involved in sim racing. After my first laps in the simulator it soon became clear that I was way off the pace of the best sim racers. Even though my lap times weren’t all that bad for a beginner, that experience opened my eyes. My ambition was aroused, and I decided to get a new simulator.” How did things progress after the initial contact? Spengler: “I didn’t have a lot of time to practice immediately afterwards because it was during racing season, but in winter – just before the current crisis – I got my new simulator and started to concentrate on it and practice seriously. With hindsight it was perfect timing, because when the crisis started I wasn’t allowed outside anymore and was able to spend a lot of time at the wheel. That opportunity to keep racing from home was particularly valuable to me. Every day I appreciated my good fortune of being able to keep pursuing my passion.” How does sim racing benefit you when it comes to real-life racing? Spengler: “Sim racing is the perfect practice for me in this special situation, but also at times without racing in general. Primarily it enhances your ability to concentrate. Since my simulator is static, I don’t have the movements and forces that I’m used to in a real racing car. I only have my eyes on the screen, my feet on the pedals and my hands on the steering wheel to feel what the car is doing. Without the accompanying movements it is much more difficult to stay focussed over a long period – particularly in hotly contested races like in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series and the DNLS powered by VCO. In addition to the excellent concentration training, in my opinion sim racing even teaches driving feeling. Because the right racing line in the simulator is also the right racing line on the real racetrack I can take many of my experiences in the simulator with me into the real racing car. An important factor for me is that I am not just practicing alone, but alongside top-class professional sim racers from whom I can learn a great deal. Whether that’s when it comes to set-up work or searching for the perfect driving style.” The virtual IMSA races in particular are helping you as a newcomer to this series to get to know the tracks, right? Spengler: “Definitely. I’ve only contested races at Daytona and Sebring so far. I haven’t ever driven on the real versions of any of the other tracks. The fact that my simulator is now enabling me to practice intensively on all the tracks on the race calendar will no doubt help me a great deal when I’m on them in the real BMW M8 GTE for the first time. Obviously, someone who has already raced in real races on the tracks will still have an advantage, but at least I have a feel for what is in store for me when I get there.” IMSA is planning to restart the season with another race at Daytona at the beginning of July. How eager are you to get back in the real BMW M8 GTE? Spengler: “Very eager. I’m really looking forward to feeling the adrenaline and forces that you only get in a real race car again. You experience just as much nervousness and tension in the simulator, at the start, for example, but I do miss the other elements. What I am really missing is the crowd. The fans at the track make our events special. They give us the final push. We don’t have that in the simulator, and unfortunately, we will have to hold our opening real-life races without spectators, but I really hope that we will be able to race in front of our fans at the track again as soon as possible. It’s part of it for me.” How much of a transition will it be going from the simulator to the real racing car? Spengler: “It will be quick I think. Obviously, we will have to get used to the forces that have an effect in the real racing car again, but no doubt after a few laps we will back in the rhythm and ready to really get going.” What are your goals for continuing your first IMSA season? Spengler: “I’ll wait and see to start with. There are just too many tracks that I don’t know well enough yet for me to have specific goals. The BMW M8 GTE performed fantastically at Daytona in January, and our sister car won, but the characteristics of most of the other tracks on the race calendar are very different. So, I will wait and see and try to get to know the tracks in real-life as quickly as possible, and naturally I will be pleased with every good result that I am able to bring home with my team-mate Connor De Phillippi.” Will you remain loyal to sim racing in the future? Spengler: “Definitely! Whenever I am at home, I will keep practicing, particularly during the winter break because I really do enjoy sim racing.”\n"}

In an interview, Pieter Nota, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Customer, Brands, Sales, talks about the advantages of the plug-in hybrid, the technology’s future and about what he expects from legislators. Because he is sure: “Our plug-in hybrids combine the best of two worlds.” Mr. Nota, as the Member of the Board who oversees sales, you are very close to the customer. What can customers expect from BMW these days when it comes to sheer driving pleasure?Our customers want what makes a typical BMW, not only in terms of design, but also the precision in agility and driving performance that they expect from the brand. And that is what they get from us. Every BMW is a true BMW – with a wide range of drive technologies. These fit the very different individual needs of our customers in terms of mobility. They depend, for example, on whether they live in the city or in the country, and also on regional conditions, such as charging infrastructure or emissions laws. We do not believe in the one technology that meets all these different mobility requirements. Rather, we want to give our customers the choice of what brings them sheer driving pleasure. For us, this is the power of choice – not only when it comes to selecting the model that best suits our customers, but also which drive system is the most suitable for them. One of these is the plug-in hybrid, which combines the advantages of the electric drive with the long-distance capability of a combustion engine. For which customers does a plug-in hybrid vehicle make sense?A plug-in hybrid vehicle combines the best of two worlds. On the one hand, in electric driving mode you drive completely emission-free and very quiet in the city. On the other, the internal combustion engine offers its full potential on long distances. So together, the two engines provide an optimal mix of efficiency, dynamics and comfort. For example, a hybrid vehicle is particularly useful for customers who commute to work using only electricity, but also occasionally cover long distances and who may only have one vehicle in the household. Provided that they regularly charge at home or work, they will also find this option cheaper than a conventional drive. A common criticism is that a plug-in hybrid is far from being as clean as a comparable combustion engine.That is simply not true. In general, the average fuel consumption that can be achieved with a plug-in hybrid vehicle is also significantly lower in practice than with comparable conventional drives. However, if the electric drive is hardly ever used, this efficiency advantage over the combustion engine is lost. A plug-in hybrid therefore makes most sense when it is regularly charged and driven in electric mode. The fuel efficiency of these vehicles therefore depends largely on the driving and usage behaviour of our customers. From personal experience, I can say that with my BMW 745Le* I achieve really low fuel consumption, with an average of around two litres. In commuter traffic, I drive up to 70% in pure electric mode and can easily recharge the vehicle when I am at the office. But customers probably choose a plug-in hybrid mainly because of the tax savings and less because they want to drive electrically, don’t they?No, that is not correct - let me make it very clear: Many customers today are buying an electrified vehicle for the first time. They first have to experience this technology and all of its advantages. Only then do they know how much electric range they actually need or how often or where they charge best. I have spoken to many customers who are absolutely convinced of the plug-in hybrid, precisely because it is optimally designed for their very different mobility requirements. So what is the BMW Group doing to encourage customers to drive their plug-in hybrids more in electric mode instead of using the combustion engine?In our latest plug-in hybrid models, for example, we use eDrive Zones Geo-Fencing technology that automatically recognises environmental zones. When entering such a zone, the vehicle automatically switches to purely electric driving mode. This helps to optimally utilise the potential of hybrid vehicles and reduce emissions. It is also even more advantageous for the user, since the electric drive system fully utilises its consumption advantages in the city. In addition, we will soon be focusing on the sporting ambitions of drivers of BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles with a loyalty program. They will receive points for every kilometre driven electrically and also for charging the high-voltage battery, which they can then exchange for rewards. We also show how the billing of privately charged traction current can be more convenient for company car users. What is the BMW Group’s outlook for the future of plug-in hybrid vehicles?In the EU alone, there are millions of people whose mobility behaviour is ideally suited to a plug-in hybrid vehicle. We are therefore consistently expanding our range of plug-in hybrids. The new BMW 5 Series, for example, which we have just launched, will initially offer five different hybrid variants. In addition, we are of course continuing to develop the drive system and will offer up to 100 kilometres of electric range in the future, depending on the segment. By the end of this year, we will already have a total of 12 basic plug-in hybrid models available, including the new MINI Countryman* and the BMW X2*. Incidentally, we already lead in terms of the breadth of the model range, both in Germany and in the EU, but also worldwide. At this point, I would like to talk about our entire range of electrified vehicles. By 2023, we aim to have a total of 25 electrified models on the road. More than half of them will be fully electric. All in all, we assume that electrified vehicles will account for between 15 and 25% of our global sales before 2025. In Europe, it will probably already be a quarter by 2021, a third by 2025 and half by 2030. This also puts us on track to meet the EU's CO2 targets. For us, the issue of climate protection is of central importance, as well as keeping our promise when it comes to political policies. You mention politics. What do you expect from legislators when it comes to electric mobility?We believe that the expansion of the charging infrastructure plays a key role in customer acceptance and the ramp-up of electric mobility. With our 360-degree approach, which we have been pursuing since 2013, we want to create the best charging options for our customers at home, at work and in public. We are continuing to work on this together with our partners on a large number of projects. Of course, we are also politically active and support initiatives to expand the public charging structure. Here we are particularly engaged in dialogue with cities that are committed to e-mobility in order to make them more liveable through better air quality and less traffic noise. Beyond charging, we believe that appropriate regulatory incentive systems, such as eZones or charging tariffs, will also make electric driving more attractive. We expect that the share of electric driving will increase further as the promotion of electric vehicle use is expanded. As a result, electric driving will become more widespread. Electric mobility has changed your company, but also the demands on your employees?The ramp-up of e-mobility is bringing about changes in very different areas – from vehicle development to sales. In production, for example, intelligent vehicle architectures will enable us to produce the same model with various drivetrains on a single line: fully electric, plug-in hybrid and conventional. This makes us extremely flexible. Of course, this also requires our employees to adapt. That’s why we have geared our training and further education toward this topic. For example, we have already trained over 46,000 employees in the field of e-mobility. That’s more than a third of our team. In-person trainings in the field of electromobility have recently started again. This shows the importance of this topic even during the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, “Blitz” training courses on the safe handling of high-voltage systems are absolutely essential for worldwide production and ramp-ups in our plants, as well as for our dealerships, where over 33,000 “Blitz” training courses have already been held. \n"}
{"prompt":"As chief engineer, Valentino Conti (GER) coordinates both race and simulator operations of BMW i Andretti Motorsport. The current break in racing offers the opportunity for him to explain the process behind the simulator work, the goals of this work, and why it is essential for success in Formula E. ->","completion":" Munich. Race weekends in the ABB FIA Formula E Championship are extraordinary events. The tight schedule of the one-day format allows little time for test work and no room for error. That makes the virtual preparations in the BMW Motorsport simulator particularly important. Ahead of each race weekend, the majority of the BMW i Andretti Motorsport team assembles in Munich (GER), where they create a solid basis for subsequent performance at the racetrack. As chief engineer, Valentino Conti (GER) coordinates both race and simulator operations. The current break in racing offers the opportunity for him to explain the process behind the simulator work, the goals of this work, and why it is essential for success in Formula E. Before the start of the current enforced break, it was the same ritual before every Formula E race weekend with engineers and drivers from the BMW i Andretti Motorsport team preparing together in the simulator for the pending event. Only this way is it possible to deal professionally with the unique challenges posed by the Formula E regulations – challenges that will hopefully be posed again soon when Season 6 is able to resume. With practice sessions, qualifying and the race on the same day, the teams have barely any time remaining for test and development work. All that has to be done in advance. “If we did not have the tests in the simulator beforehand, we would be lacking a lot of performance,” said Conti, who has held the role of chief engineer since the start of the current season. “Any knowledge you don’t acquire in the simulator is very difficult to catch up on at the circuit.” As a rule, the BMW i Andretti Motorsport engineers’ intensive preparations begin with planning meetings and a functional test for the software, which supplies the simulator with the respective circuit and car data. Nearly all the engineers and the two drivers, Maximilian Günther (GER) and Alexander Sims (GBR), meet in the week leading up to the race. Anyone unable to be there can join the sessions online. “95 percent of the engineers are usually involved in the preparations, plus a few people who are responsible for the operational process in the simulator,” said Conti, who went on to explain his philosophy. “I like to have as many people as possible at the simulator tests, whether it be engineers or drivers. In my opinion, that is imperative. The whole team arrives at the racetrack with a totally different basis when it comes to knowledge and experience. It is very difficult to convey this knowledge on site to someone who was not there during the preparations.” As well as the actual simulator, which recreates the actual cockpit of the BMW iFE.20 right down to the smallest detail to make it as close to reality as possible for the drivers, the simulator’s moving platform and a screen, there is also a special control room. In this room, the engineers use the same communications and computer programmes as they do at the racetrack. This allows the drivers and the entire team to train as precisely as possible for the real thing. Conti places great importance on team spirit: “We work as one unit. Only that way can we be efficient.” With that in mind, it goes without saying that the Andretti engineers are in close communication with their colleagues, either on site in Munich or online. The itinerary for the test sessions are based on a plan, which is determined in advance. It starts with a comparison of data gathered at the previous race. That is followed by many short runs, the aim of which is to try out different set-ups and configurations of the BMW i drivetrain. Race simulations and energy management tests are also integral components. Conti and his team also play out various scenarios to be prepared for unpredictable events that may occur on a race weekend – for example, safety car periods and race interruptions. Even with all this meticulousness attention, how exactly is it actually possible to prepare for reality in the simulator? “We have a high rate of success,” said Conti. “We have even had situations where we have been able to implement the energy management strategy we developed in the simulator on a 1:1 basis in the race.” However, Conti, who has been involved in Formula E since Season 4 and whose previous success includes winning the DTM title in 2012 as Bruno Spengler’s (CAN) race engineer, is also keen to play down this success. “That success rate obviously fluctuates. There are always certain surprises at the circuit. However, thanks to being well prepared, we are generally able to react to them very quickly.” The track walk, on which the drivers and engineers walk the circuit on the day before the respective Formula E race, plays a very important role in being able to check for any differences to the version they had driven in the simulator. Has the radius of a corner changed? Can you cut the kerbs or are they possibly too high? What exactly do the pit lane entry and the activation zone for ATTACK MODE look like? All of these details are compared before the BMW iFE.20 takes to the track for the first time in the shakedown, usually on the Friday afternoon. “The shakedown is really nothing more than a functional test, but we also use it to compare the grip conditions to those that we had simulated in advance,” explained Conti. “We then discuss whether we may need to change things, before we prepare our plans A, B and C for the race day to be able to react as flexibly as possible. It is one thing after another on the Saturday and there is no time for any major discussions.” How good a job was done in the simulator is revealed by the first practice session on the morning of the race day, if not beforehand in the shakedown. Any major issues encountered make life difficult. “On the odd occasion, even we can get the set-up wrong,” said Conti. “You can catch up, but it is difficult: the competition, who may arrive better prepared, are improving all the time, which means you must improve faster than they do.” The chief engineer quoted the opening round of Season 6, in Ad Diriyah (KSA) last November, as a positive example of this kind of fightback. “We were surprised by the extremely low grip levels there, which we had not predicted in the simulation. However, we are able to react to that quickly and claimed two pole positions and victory in the Saturday race.” It remains uncertain when the BMW i Andretti Motorsport team will return to the real racetrack after the current break. When that time does come, however, Conti and his team-mates want to be ready. To ensure that is the case, they are regularly in the simulator to run through their processes – whilst observing all safety measures, of course – “just to stay in training,” said Conti.\n"}

The first Managing Director of BMW Motorsport GmbH and the BMW Junior Team is supporting the current crop of Juniors – Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) – as a mentor. In an interview, he compares their current situation with the prerequisites of the legendary first BMW Junior Team back in 1977.Video clips on Jochen Neerpasch and the BMW Junior Team:Jochen Neerpasch on the beginnings of BMW youth development:https:\/\/b.mw\/junior_team_YTJochen Neerpasch on the founding of BMW Motorsport GmbH:https:\/\/b.mw\/History_of_M.The BMW Junior Team on working with Jochen Neerpasch:https:\/\/b.mw\/Jochen_Neerpasch.Mr Neerpasch, you have shaped the history of BMW Motorsport for many years since 1972. You have now breathed new life into the idea of the BMW Junior Team. How did that come about?Jochen Neerpasch: “BMW Motorsport came to me and asked me to help them develop a new prioritisation for youth development. I then suggested going back to supporting a BMW Junior Team. After all, BMW had succeeded in bringing through some very successful, talented youngsters in recent decades – but always individually.”Why does team spirit play such a key role for you?Neerpasch: “As a team, you see more, experience more, chat to each other, and help one another. That was clear for all to see with the first BMW Junior Team in 1977, and it plays an even bigger role now, as the Juniors will share a car in the endurance races on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife. They must learn together, to improve together. That way, they will develop far faster than if each were to work alone.”Why did you decide on Dan Harper, Max Hesse and Neil Verhagen?Neerpasch: “We looked for drivers who have improved continuously in their respective classes. They had to have been in the top third in each category they raced in. Furthermore, it was important to us to assemble a team of international drivers with different cultural backgrounds and characters. They should complement each other and learn from one another.”For comparison, how was the original BMW Junior Team selected in 1977?Neerpasch: “It was basically the same system. Eddie Cheever, Marc Surer and Manfred Winkelhock were among the most promising young drivers in various categories at that time – and they too were an international team with different characters. In their case, you could see how well they worked as a team and how much faster they developed as a result. Based on this experience, we took a very similar approach when putting together today’s BMW Junior Team.”Back then, Cheever, Surer and Winkelhock were renowned for their aggressive driving style. However, you did not try to stop them. Why not?Neerpasch: “Because that was the philosophy. They should drive freely. Back then, we even let them take on our experienced drivers in the German Motor Racing Championship – first to learn from them, then to challenge them. Our approach was not to win the title with the BMW Junior Team, but to develop the talented youngsters. That is how we will handle matters with the current BMW Junior Team too.”Are you still in touch with Eddie Cheever and Marc Surer?Neerpasch: “Yes, absolutely. More than just in touch: I am sure that we will meet more regularly again as soon as possible. They are both intrigued to meet their successors, and to watch them at the racetrack.”How did you come up with the idea of supporting young racing drivers in particular?Neerpasch: “When I used to enter races myself in the 1960s, motorsport was not regarded as a sport. As such, a racing driver was not seen as an athlete, but a driver. The car did all the work. Accordingly, the drivers at the time were not as well prepared physically for the exertions. I focussed on this point as head of racing, after my active career. I wanted to place the emphasis on the combination of man and machine, and to support the racing drivers in their preparation. Back then, I was already convinced that the best car is worth nothing, if the driver is unable to exploit its full potential. BMW was the first manufacturer to professionally prepare drivers for races.”How has motor racing changed in recent decades, from a driver’s perspective?Neerpasch: “The demands placed on a racing driver today are completely different to my time. Back then, driving a racing car was more of an adventure, because there were next to no technical aids. The driver was all by himself in the car, and was only able to give the engineer any feedback on the way the car was handling once he returned to the garage. Nowadays, some of the technology is more advanced than the driver and even tells him how to react in certain situations. This means that other skills are required of today’s racing drivers. The sensors he has to use, in order to get the best out of himself and his car, are something completely different. You obviously need special training methods to train this – such as the wholistic mental and fitness training concept at Formula Medicine, for example.”At the time of the first BMW Junior Team, you were head of BMW Motorsport GmbH. What do you remember from that time?Neerpasch: “As early as the end of the 1960, Ford approached me and asked me to join their management as head of racing. As I was at the peak of my career as a racing driver at that time, that was one of the toughest decisions I have ever made. However, I decided to take them up on their offer, and never regretted doing so. I single-handedly built up a specific racing department there, and when we started to beat the BMW coupes of that time with our Ford Capri, the BMW sales director asked me to come to Munich at the start of 1972. I signed my contract a few months later. BMW wanted to reorganise its motorsport commitment. Based on my experience at Ford, I requested a flexible organisation from the outset. There had to be a separate motorsport department, which built the racing cars and then, based on these cars, developed high-performance and sporty cars for the streets, with which it would be possible to make money. We got cracking in May 1972 and first developed the BMW 3.0 CSL, which went on to become the most successful touring car over the following years. Generally speaking, BMW Motorsport GmbH developed very quickly. That was the best time of my career.”How do you look back now on the project you started back then?Neerpasch: “I am very proud to see what has become of BMW M GmbH. They build fantastic cars, which are perfect for both the racetrack and the road.”One of the icons of BMW M GmbH, and probably your biggest project, was the BMW M1, wasn’t it?Neerpasch: “The BMW M1 was definitely the highlight of my time at BMW. The project was not only big, but also tough. The idea was not to transform a road car into a racing car, as had been the way up to then, but to develop a racing car and then derive a road version from it. As it was not possible to build the BMW M1 in the BMW plant, we at BMW Motorsport GmbH took full responsibility for development, production and sales. That was a very ambitious project. Unfortunately, we had many issues with production, which is why we were unable to get the BMW M1 homologated for motorsport. Together with Max Mosley and Bernie Ecclestone, we came up with the idea of launching the M1 Procar series on the support programme for Formula 1. The head-to-head battles between Formula 1 stars and established sports and touring car drivers, in identical cars, were iconic. The top five Formula 1 drivers always went head to head. Those races in the BMW M1 were fantastic and real crowd-pullers.”Do you still drive a BMW M1 now and again these days?Neerpasch: “I do. The BMW M1 is still fantastic to drive. I used to have one myself, but sold it at some point. It’s a shame actually, as it would probably be worth a fortune today.”\n"}

Kicking things off could be the Nürburgring Endurance Series, which is working closely with the relevant authorities with the goal being to start the season on 27th June. The DTM Trophy plans to start its season on 1st August at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). The success record in the 2019 season was impressive. BMW M Customer Racing teams won 53 races and claimed more than 170 podium finishes with their BMW M4 GT4s – and not just anywhere, but in some of the world’s top racing series in the GT4 category, which has enjoyed a boom in recent years. The BMW M4 GT4 is without doubt a successful model; so far, 102 cars have been sold in Europe, Asia, North America and Australia. In 2020, the BMW M4 GT4 appears in the starting lists of more than 15 racing series and individual events all over the world. They range from the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER), the GT4 European Series, ADAC GT4 Germany and the DTM trophy to the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge, GT4 America and the GT World Challenge Asia. On the Nordschleife, the BMW M4 GT4 is strongly represented in the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS). There is a good chance that the teams may contest their first races of the season in that series. As organiser of the NLS races, VLN is working closely with health authorities and politicians to implement its concept for running races in accordance with all the standards that are essential to guaranteeing the health and safety of all involved during the current crisis. Should everything go to plan, the first four-hour race will be held on 27th June. The teams involved are now working towards that date with great motivation. The same goes for those in the DTM Trophy. The amended calendar, consisting of six events, was released this week. The season-opener will take place at Spa-Francorchamps on 1st\/2nd August. That will be followed by a round at the Lausitzring (GER), two visits to the Nürburgring (GER), and race weekends in Zolder (BEL) and Hockenheim (GER). When the wait is finally over, BMW M Customer Racing will offer its teams a strong new partner, having entered into a technical partnership in the GT4 sector with Ravensberger Schmierstoffvertrieb GmbH and its brand RAVENOL. BMW M Customer Racing has successfully tested the RAVENOL RSP SAE 5W-30 engine oil and the RAVENOL Racing Gearoil 75W-140 differential oil in the BMW M4 GT4, and has approved both oils. In future, all customer teams will find these products in the car’s manuals, and RAVENOL will equip every BMW M4 GT4 sold with a starter kit, consisting of appropriate lubricants. The logo of the lubricant specialists from eastern Westphalia will also be visible on all the cars delivered. “We share the joy of competitive motorsport and the demand to consistently redefine the limits of performance with BMW M Motorsport. We all hope that VLN is able to implement its race concept in the current difficult situation, and we can all get back to dedicating ourselves to our shared passion, whilst observing all the necessary safety measures,” said Martin Huning, Director Motorsport RAVENOL. “GT racing is a very important field for us, and we are delighted with the technical collaboration in the GT4 sector. This class of car is very close to production and offers an affordable route into GT racing. It has become a successful, long-term concept.”\n"}

In an interview, BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt explains the situation in the DTM and takes a stand in the discussion regarding the future of the race series. Mr. Marquardt, in your opinion, what affect is the coronavirus pandemic having on motorsport in general? Jens Marquardt: “The pandemic is having a serious impact on everything and everyone – this obviously also includes the automotive industry and motorsport, which relies largely upon its events and the fans at the racetrack. I see the prospects for motorsport in three periods: in the short term, after everything the scientists and politicians had been telling us for weeks, it was absolutely essential to stop all racing operations. Medium term, we are hopeful – particularly after the announcement of the amended DTM calendar – that we will still be able to go racing this year, implementing concepts adapted to the pandemic, and to see our BMW M4 DTM in action. I am not prepared to make any long-term predictions, as the overall situation is too unpredictable.” Going back a few weeks, would you have believed that there would be any motor racing at all this year? Marquardt: “Even given all the uncertainty that is inevitable when the situation is so fragile, I was still always hopeful that we would return to the racetrack this year. The signs of that happening are now a little better than they were previously. However, I feel it is important to stress that we are only able and willing to go racing again when the general situation allows it and the politicians are satisfied with the concepts. With this in mind, I would like to pay a big compliment: The hygiene concept that the manufacturers and ITR have worked on together is very well thought out and puts the health and safety of everyone involved in the DTM at the forefront of everything. We will obviously have to live with the fact that our fans will not be at the racetrack to support us. That is a real downer, but I believe we can still put on a good show on the screen.” What are your feelings as you prepare for the DTM season? Marquardt: “To be perfectly honest – I have mixed feelings. The coronavirus pandemic obviously overshadows everything. However, when I look at it from a sporting perspective, we are more determined than ever to prove that our package is capable of more than we managed to show in the second half of last season. We have worked hard to make this possible during the long period of preparation. However, with all the anticipation ahead of the coming season, I will openly admit that the announcements by our competitors that they will be withdrawing from the series have tarnished the coming months and years.” What do you mean? Marquardt: “We had two focusses: on the one hand, to offer fans great racing again in 2020 – on the screen, at least – and to achieve the prerequisites for this to happen. On the other hand, to prepare the DTM for the future and to work together to put the finishing touches to the 2022 hybridisation and the electrification in 2025. This second focus is now obviously no more.” What does that mean for the future of the DTM? Marquardt: “All our works motorsport commitments have exactly the same DNA as the DTM, namely competition between manufacturers at the highest level. That is what the DTM as a series, and the underlying Class 1 regulations, are designed for. The withdrawal of Audi contradicts that. That much is clear.” When will you decide about a possible 2021 season? Marquardt: “It is not up to BMW alone to make a decision. Now it is important to work together within the ITR committees to clarify and illustrate the effects of the Audi withdrawal. Once that has been achieved, we will see what it means for the DTM, the underlying Class 1 regulations, and the future.” What is your focus on now? Marquardt: “Our focus is still fully on the 2020 season. Everyone in our team is highly motivated and can hardly wait for next week’s tests at the Nürburgring. The launch of the amended DTM calendar has made us all even hungrier for the start of the season. Concentrating on Germany and its immediate neighbours, Belgium and the Netherlands, is in keeping with the order of the day – not to have any unnecessarily long journeys or transport routes. I also welcome the scheduling of back-to-back race weekends at the same circuit. That is also an expression of maximum efficiency and planning security. I can only stress once again, we remain passionate about the DTM – and we want to offer all the fans great racing in 2020. That is what we are now preparing for.”\n"}
{"prompt":"In an interview, Kevin Siggy (SLO) talks about virtual Formula E, the feeling of driving for a manufacturer like BMW and his connection with BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver Maximilian Günther (GER), who currently lies third in the overall standings for Formula E drivers with two races remaining. ->","completion":" Munich. Ahead of the final weekend of the “ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge” season with one race on Saturday and the Grand Final on Sunday, Team Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) as a representative of BMW i Andretti Motorsport leads the overall standings in the Challenge Grid, in which professional sim racers and guest starters go head to head. If the 21-year-old is able to win the Grand Final at the wheel of the virtual BMW iFE.20, his reward will be a test drive in a real Formula E car and a starting spot in the final of the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup at the BMW SIM Live event in Munich (GER) at the end of the year. In an interview, Siggy talks about virtual Formula E, the feeling of driving for a manufacturer like BMW and his connection with BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver Maximilian Günther (GER), who currently lies third in the overall standings for Formula E drivers with two races remaining. Kevin, you’re representing the colours of BMW i Andretti Motorsport in the Challenge Grid excellently. Why are you so strong in the “ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge”? Kevin Siggy: “I think it’s primarily down to my vast experience on the rFactor 2 platform. I’ve been racing on it since I was 13 years old and recently passed the 1,000 hours mark. All the practice has given me a very good understanding of how the simulation, set-up, tyre model, grip on the track and weather work.” How intensely do you practice before each Formula E race? Siggy: “We only ever find out which track we will be racing on a few days before the race. So it depends whether I have already raced on the track or if – like the ones in Berlin and New York recently – it is a new track. On a track like Hong Kong, which I was already familiar with, I only drove a few laps to get back into my rhythm. Naturally, for new tracks I take more time. First of all I do up to 50 laps to familiarise myself with the track. Then on race day I do another two to three hours to test my limits and to find the optimum rhythm for qualifying, which is the most important factor in my opinion. And then I also help Maximilian Günther with his preparations...” So, he asks you for advice? Siggy: “That’s right! He became aware of me during the test round and got in touch with me. I have mainly given him a few tips from my experience with rFactor 2, which helped him develop a good set-up and a way of driving that suited him. Then he told me that the handling isn’t the same as the real BMW iFE.20. He had to adapt and do a few things in the simulator that he wouldn’t do with the real race car.” To what extent is this type of collaboration standard? Siggy: “The way that Maximilian and I are collaborating is very standard in this environment. We meet online for a joint training session ahead of a race. He asks questions, I give him tips wherever I can. It’s nothing more than that. A lot of other sim racers and real-life racing drivers are doing the same thing.” You and Maximilian Günther have both won several races this season. But he isn’t quite as consistent as you. Why is this? Siggy: “I think that because he doesn’t have much experience of sim racing yet, he doesn’t have very much time to prepare for the new tracks. However, he is doing a fantastic job and is learning really quickly, which is what you need to be successful in sim racing. Generally speaking, it needs to be taken into account that as sim racers we earn our living this way and so have spent a lot of time practicing for many years. Even a professional racing driver like Maximilian can’t catch up in just a few months because the handling in a simulator is totally different to in a real racing car.” What does it mean to you to start for BMW in the virtual Formula E? Siggy: “Starting for a manufacturer like BMW is one of the biggest things you can imagine as a sim racer. I feel honoured.” How did the contact come about? Siggy: “I have Team Redline, who I have been racing for as a professional sim racer since March, to thank for this. They set up the communication with BMW and have supported my start in virtual Formula E from the very beginning.” So, you have only been representing Team Redline for a short while? Siggy: “That’s right. I have been a professional sim racer for about two years and am happy to be able to say that I can now make a living from it. I won a few important races this year, which is obviously what attracted the attention of a big team like Redline. They got in contact with me in March and I signed my contract.” What do you think of the boom in sim racing, which was brought about by the current global crisis? Siggy: “First of all, the situation, we all currently find ourselves in is not pleasant at all and will hopefully be over soon. But to be honest it was a huge boost for sim racing. On the one hand, it is cool for someone like me to be able to compete with real racing drivers and to earn their respect. On the other hand, as sim racers we are now gaining much more publicity, which obviously helps us immensely as pros. A year ago I couldn’t have imagined earning my living through sim racing alone. That is changing now.” If you are able to win the Grand Final of the “ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge”, the prizes that await you are a test drive in a real Formula E car and a ticket for the final in the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup. Siggy: “Both are fantastic! Being at the Cup final live in Munich and meeting Maximilian and all the other racing drivers would be cool. And I would really love to drive the real Formula E car because it’s something that I have always dreamed of. Unfortunately, I haven’t had the necessary funds to be able to get involved in real racing. This test drive would be a fantastic opportunity to show what I can do.” Live streams of the ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge: Saturday, 16:30hrs CEST:Facebook: https:\/\/b.mw\/RaceAtHomeChallenge7FB.YouTube: https:\/\/b.mw\/RaceAtHomeChallenge7YT. Sunday, 16:30hrs CEST:Facebook: https:\/\/b.mw\/RaHC_final_FB.YouTube: https:\/\/b.mw\/RaHC_final_YT.\n"}

The BMW teams have continued their success story on the virtual Nürburgring Nordschleife (GER) in the fifth race of the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO. The MAHLE 3-hour race on Saturday featured two podium finishes for the BMW Z4 GT3. BMW works driver Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Team BMW Bank secured second place in the #107 car. Third place went to the Walkenhorst Motorsport #35 BMW Z4 GT3. A BMW Z4 GT3 also finished in fourth and fifth positions. Spengler and his team-mate Nils Koch (GER) started the race from sixth place. Although a 35-second penalty was imposed on them after an incident with a TCR car, the duo from Team BMW Bank gradually worked their way up through the field thanks to a smart strategy. After Spengler and Koch had shared driving duties for three hours of racing, they were able to celebrate finishing second. The thrilling battle for third place went all the way to the line. In the end, Christian Krognes (NOR) in the #35 BMW Z4 GT3 was able to hold off the pressure applied by BMW works driver Philipp Eng (AUT), chasing him in the #189 car. Krognes and his Walkenhorst Motorsport team-mate, Mikkel Jensen (DEN), claimed third place. Eng, who again shared driving duties in the cockpit of the BS+COMPETITION BMW Z4 GT3 with Alexander Voß (GER), had been the best BMW driver in qualifying, as he secured fourth place. He swiftly moved into third during the race, but the subsequent battle for second place saw a collision with the MAHLE RACING TEAM Audi. The resulting penalty imposed on Eng pushed the #189 back down through the field. Eng battled back to challenge for a podium finish on the final lap, just missing out by a few tenths of a second. The Walkenhorst Motorsport #34 BMW Z4 GT3, driven by David Pittard and Sam and Scott Michaels (all GBR), finished in fifth position. A total of nine BMW Z4 GT3s were competing in the fifth race of the DNLS powered by VCO. The other BMW works drivers in the race were Martin Tomczyk, Jens Klingmann (both GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN), John Edwards (USA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR), as well as the BMW Junior Team with Max Hesse (GER), Dan Harper (GBR) and Neil Verhagen (USA). Reactions to the fifth race in the DNLS powered by VCO: Bruno Spengler: “We are very pleased with the second place. Even though we might even have won the race without that incident and the resulting 35-second penalty. But that’s all part of it.” Philipp Eng: “Of course, it was a shame that there was an accident during the battle for second place. I knew that to have a chance of overtaking in the slipstream, I had to be up close at the entry to Döttinger Höhe. The initial contact in the Tiergarten turn was just unlucky. After that I had to go across the grass and then I touched the other car again when I returned to the track. We were very close to one another and maybe I didn’t gauge the distance entirely correctly on the simulator. It’s quite a different feeling in a real car, as you actually are driving door to door. It’s a bit more difficult to judge it correctly in sim racing.” \n"}

Alexander Sims (GBR) in the second BMW iFE.20 finished in 14th place. In the Challenge Grid Race, Team Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) extended his lead in the overall standings with his third win of the season after a commanding performance. Cem Bolukbasi (TUR) finished fourth in the second BMW iFE.20. Günther spun in the first turn after Neel Jani (SUI, Porsche) hit the rear of his car. As a result he had to let the whole field pass him. He went on to fight his way back up into 12th place, but, like Sims in 14th place, finished outside the points. Victory went to Stoffel Vandoorne (BEL, Mercedes). Siggy pulled away quickly from pole position in the Challenge Grid Race and drove a lonely race at the front. He now has a comfortable lead in the overall standings, with a total of 129 points to his name. Bolukbasi finished fourth, narrowly missing out on the podium in only his second race in the colours of BMW i Andretti Motorsport. The season finale will be held next weekend, when there will be a race on both Saturday and Sunday. Reactions to Round 6: Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, race result: 12th place, overall standings: 73 points): “To be taken out from behind in the first turn after such a good qualifying session and a good start is a real shame. Unfortunately this wasn’t the first time in recent races that I have been hit by rivals when I was in a promising position. But I won’t give up. I will go on the attack again on the final weekend and will give it my all to bring home another few good results. I had no chance today after the accident. My car was so badly damaged that my steering wheel was totally crooked. I couldn’t do any better than 12th place.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, race result: 14th place, overall standings: 1 point): “It was fun once again. I got through the first turn really well from the start and was in tenth place. Unfortunately my car was damaged after coming into contact with the wall and I wasn’t able to keep hold of the position. Then, during the race I let Maximilian go past because he was much faster than me. It’s a shame that he had such a difficult race. I’m not ever usually in the position of being ahead of him in the simulator and being overtaken by him.” Kevin Siggy (#28 BMW iFE.20, Team Redline, 1st place, overall standings: 129 points): “Everything really did go perfectly. Fortunately, at the start I got away well from pole position, which meant I didn’t get caught up in the huge crash in the first turn. From that point on, I drove a few fast laps to pull away from the others quickly. That worked really well, and I was able to bring the win home safely in the end.”\n"}

After about half a year of intensive development work, the BMW M4 GT4 is set to make its virtual debut on the sim racing platform iRacing in June. To make sure that the BMW M customer racing car is as realistic as possible, iRacing developers are working as intensively with the BMW Motorsport engineers as if they were working on a real racing car. Maximum transparency is the key to an optimum result. We explain the journey of the BMW M4 GT4, from the signing of the licence agreement to being ready to race. It’s time in just a few days. The BMW M4 GT4 will be another current BMW racing car after the BMW M8 GTE to make its sim racing debut on the iRacing platform. When the users contest their first races in June, the iRacing developers and BMW Motorsport engineers will have a phase of intensive collaboration behind them. “I can’t wait for it to get started,” said Kevin Bobbitt, Director of Marketing at iRacing, emphasising “The openness with which BMW Motorsport met us in this project is fantastic. The communication channels were very short, and you could tell by their involvement that this project is really important to them.” For some time now, sim racing has been one of the pillars in the BMW Motorsport portfolio. Those responsible had identified the potential of virtual racing before it experienced a boom during the current break from real-world racing. “BMW Motorsport knows the difference between a standard racing game and a real racing simulation, and values it,” said Bobbitt. “A simulation as realistic as this also benefits the manufacturer, because many more people can test the cars and in the best-case scenario might even go on to buy one.” As head of vehicle development, Rudolf Dittrich is also responsible for the field of sim racing at BMW Motorsport. He confirms the strong customer focus behind the BMW M4 GT4 project. “We want to give our customer teams the opportunity to experience the BMW M4 GT4 virtually,” he said, explaining the advantages, “they can upload and use their own liveries with their own sponsors. Their drivers can also practice on their own in the current break. And potential new customers might even develop a taste for it and think about racing with a BMW M4 GT4 in real life.” How the collaboration between BMW Motorsport and iRacing works.Maximum authenticity requires the virtual car to be as close as possible to its real-life counterpart which was the joint mission of BMW Motorsport and iRacing. What do you need for that? “We need three things from the car: the laser scans, the CAD data and photos as a reference,” explained Brian Simpson, Senior Art Manager at iRacing. “The collaboration with BMW Motorsport was easy in that respect, because we got precisely the data that we needed. I didn’t have to start time-consuming research myself like for other cars, I could simply use the material I was provided with.” Dittrich explains the data transfer process: “Everything starts with the licence agreement, which is the basis for the transfer of confidential data. Then the developers receive two large data packages of several gigabytes each. Firstly the CAD data with all the specifications of the car parts. That is exactly the same data that a supplier gets from us to produce the real component. iRacing also scanned a real car, in this case the Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT4. The second large data package contained all the information on driving dynamics. We use the same data set to do a lap time simulation or to operate our BMW Motorsport simulator, for example. This data includes damper curves, engine performance curves, axle kinematics, weight distribution, aerodynamic values: any figures that we had calculated for the car we passed on to iRacing.” Dittrich’s conclusion of the collaboration is that “iRacing now know as much about the car as our customer teams do.” Steve Reiss: “The initial feedback is very positive.”The first impression is that this transparency has paid off. “The more real vehicle data we receive, the closer we get to the real driving dynamics. In the case of our BMW M4 GT4 the initial feedback from people who have driven the real car is very positive,” said Steve Reiss, Senior Vehicle Dynamics Engineer at iRacing. It goes without saying that the driving dynamic plays the crucial role in user satisfaction, but even the most minute of details are important for realism. “First, our designers parse the data provided and use it to make the basic car. Once we’ve got that, it’s time for the details such as spinning wheels, displays and much more,” explained Simpson. “In that respect BMW Motorsport is incredible. They even sent us information on in which situations which lights on the steering wheel come on, and what information is displayed when, which buttons the driver presses when, and what happens when they do. I really enjoy working on those displays right down to the last detail.” First major race event for the BMW M4 GT4 planned for 13th June.At the end of a continuous development period of about six months, BMW Motorsport inspect the virtual car which is also no different from reality. “The idea is to inspect the virtual car in exactly the same way as a real car,” said Dittrich. “This ranges from the external appearance, through handling, to details such as cable routing in the interior, light or texture of the dashboard. After all, we are ultimately responsible for the virtual BMW M4 GT4 meeting all the requirements that we and our customers have for a real racing car.” For virtual customers the H&R 3-hour race in the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO on 13th June will be the first major event that they can contest in the BMW M4 GT4. As soon as the car is up for sale on iRacing, the sim racers – and the BMW customer teams involved in sim racing – can download it, kit it out with their personalised designs and test it thoroughly. Live streams of the DNLS powered by VCO (Sat., 13:00hrs CEST):Facebook: b.mw\/DNLS_FBYouTube: b.mw\/DNLS_live_YTTwitch: www.twitch.tv\/bmwmotorsport Live streams of the ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge (Sat., 16:30hrs CEST):Facebook: b.mw\/RaceAtHomeChallenge6FBYouTube: b.mw\/RaceAtHomeChallenge6YT\n"}

The fifth and penultimate race of the IMSA iRacing Pro Series season at ‘Virginia International Raceway’ (USA) marked the first time that BMW drivers were unable to convert the great pace of the virtual BMW M8 GTE into a podium finish. Just before the end, Bruno Spengler (CAN) fell back from second place to fifth, but finished as the best-placed BMW driver and extended his overall lead. Jesse Krohn (FIN) had been in the lead until the penultimate lap, but spun out after eventual winner Kenton Koch (USA, Ford) hit him from behind during the battle for the win. He finished the race in ninth place, behind his BMW team-mates John Edwards, Connor De Phillippi (both USA) and Philipp Eng (AUT) in sixth, seventh and eighth positions. Right up until the turbulent closing laps, it seemed that Spengler and Krohn were assured spots on the podium. They were in second and third positions, putting leader Koch under pressure when Spengler spun when forced to evade a lapped car that had left the circuit however. Not long after, Krohn grabbed the lead in a spectacular battle with Koch, but fell back even further than Spengler after contact with the Ford driver during his counter-attack. There were great recovery performances from Edwards, De Phillippi and especially Eng, who had started the race just three rows from the back of the grid. Nick Catsburg (NED), second in the overall standings ahead of the race, had to start from the penultimate row of the grid thanks to an error in qualifying. He gave a great drive to reach the top ten but was also involved in an incident and finished the race in 28th place after his repair stop. The season finale takes place on 11th June. Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW M8 GTE, BMW IMSA Team Red, 5th place): “I was faster than Koch throughout the whole race but attempting to overtake him on this circuit would have been very risky. In view of the championship situation, that was a risk I was not willing to take. Nonetheless, I looked sure to reach the podium until a Ferrari spun in front of us. I lost the rear end a little as I tried to avoid him and Jesse just touched me as he was so close behind. That was enough to spin me around and I was back in fifth place. At least I was able to continue and score some more important points. That was good. Many thanks to everyone who ensured that my BMW M8 GTE was super-fast once again.”\n"}

And despite its size, it’s still a MINI; it packs its clever functionality into a comparatively small footprint. With the new MINI Countryman, we’re bringing this character even further to the fore with a host of design elements. At the same time, we’ve adopted a deliberately reduced approach to the design around those elements in order to create more space for them and therefore for the emotionality of the new MINI Countryman. From the outside, how do you know you’re looking at the new MINI Countryman?We’ve brought expressive new details to the MINI Countryman which will move it on again in terms of modernity, poise and assurance. We’ve also raised the profile of all those things that give the Countryman its identity as a MINI. At the front end, the car’s focused look is clearly visible from a long way off. The headlights are a clean-sheet design technically and absolutely state of the art. We have deliberately retained the eye-catching, almost angular headlight contours of the existing Countryman as an identifying and distinguishing feature of the model within the MINI family. The clearly defined radiator grille projects out visually between the headlights, with its distinctive surround in chrome or the appropriately named new Black Line specification.Change is most apparent in the front apron. In place of the design’s previously horizontal emphasis, we have shifted the focus to verticality and solidity of stance. This means the outer air intakes have grown and now stand upright. And the amount of the car in body colour has increased. The mostly painted finish of the front apron provides a classy border for the new elements.At the rear, the new tail lights catch the eye immediately. Their abstract take on the Union Jacks translates our British heritage into cutting-edge technology. A special detail here are the glass covers, which replicate the light elements below them like a relief sculpture. The dark shading of the glass underlines the feeling of solidity and exclusivity.The stylistic underbody protection elements are an important part of the rear apron on the MINI Countryman – especially on examples with the ALL4 package – and we’ve added even greater prominence to this area of the new MINI Countryman. Like in the front apron, we’re emphasising verticality by standing the reflectors upright and positioning them far to the outer edges of the rear.One small highlight of the car is the new wheel design we’re offering exclusively as part of the ALL4 package. These new rims in modern bi-colour design are visually powerful and exude solidity. The contrast between dark grey spokes and bare machined surfaces is very modern and spotlights the character of the MINI Countryman through its details. How important are details to the overall effect? Details contribute massively to the effect of a vehicle as a whole. You can almost create the impression of a totally new product just by working on details. Indeed, it is the details that tell you what era or generation a vehicle belongs to. Take the lights. They not only give a car its face but also say a lot about the vintage of its engineering. Or there’s the use of chrome. Chrome accents have been a big theme at MINI for a long time. But with Black Line, we’re offering the new MINI Countryman with an interesting alternative. This equipment variant turns all the chrome elements high-gloss black, which lends the whole of the exterior even greater sportiness and modernity – in particular in combination with the new exterior paint shade Sage Green metallic. This year, a fully electric version of the MINI with its own distinctive design has gone on sale. Will some of this model’s styling find its way into the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 plug-in hybrid? With the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 we’re taking our lead from the MINI Cooper SE. So there’s an E badge on the charging flap front left and an S – standing for the Cooper S engine – in Electric Yellow on the front grille. The electric genes of the MINI are therefore immediately apparent. We have also made the part-electric heart of the car clearly visible in the interior. The fully digital instrument cluster is particularly prominent in bringing the modernity of the drive system into the cabin. However, the drive system-specific design elements should not overshadow the overall concept; the customer is first and foremost deciding to buy a MINI – the brand and the experience. The drive system comes lower down the list of importance. What interior changes have been made for the new MINI Countryman? The Countryman is the youngest member of the MINI family, and as before you can see that clearly in its modern interior ambience. Its striking appearance, with the vertical air vents, provides the ideal setting for the new fully digital instrument cluster and newly designed circular instrument – the icon at the centre of the car. We’ve made the area above and below the monitor a lot less busy. There are no longer any individual controls here, just a flush-fitting high-quality touch surface. This change gives the whole centre console area a much more visually impressive and modern look. What does the new MINI Countryman tell us about the future of MINI?What the MINI Countryman already shows and what we are looking to build on further at MINI in the future is “reduction” as a basic principle. By leaving things out, the elements that are left can have the best possible impact. I’m thinking of the vehicle’s character and what you can experience with it. Cleaning up the styling is a first step in this direction. Then comes functional reduction. The underlying principle here is: focus on the important stuff. Everything else takes a back seat. What can we expect from MINI in the future?In future we want people to see MINI above all as an experience. Reduction – leaving things out – is key for us here. But that in no way means going without or missing out. Rather, leaving out creates space for maximum emotionality. Instead of “What can we do more of?”, we’re focusing on “What is really necessary for the customer to be able to – and to really want to – form a personal bond with their MINI?”. We see MINI in the future as a sort of “partner in crime”. This personal approach is what MINI is all about: the customer should see themselves in their MINI and be able to build up a connection even stronger than it is today. One last question: What would be your preferred specification for the new MINI Countryman, the “designer’s choice”? I personally like the MINI Countryman as a Cooper S and in Sage Green with the ALL4 package and Black Line trim. My choice for the interior would be MINI Yours Leather Lounge in Carbon Black. This variant is a real head-turner. For me, it sums up the combination of the MINI twist and the feeling of adventure and off-road attitude; you could say it epitomises the character of the new MINI Countryman. Oliver Heilmer is also on Instagram: follow Oliver.Heilmer\n"}

The fifth race of the season in the ‘ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge’ was a home race for BMW i Andretti Motorsport and Maximilian Günther (GER), as it took place on the virtual airfield circuit at Berlin-Tempelhof (GER). Günther finished seventh to score points in the drivers’ standings in which he now lies third. Alexander Sims (GBR) finished the race in 15th place. In the Challenge Grid race, Team Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) recorded his second win of this season in the BMW iFE.20 to extend his lead in the overall standings. In the race for Formula E drivers, Günther was in fourth place when a feisty battle led to a collision with Pascal Wehrlein (GER, Mahindra). Günther was pushed into the wall and spun his car. He fell back to eighth place before recovering to cross the line in seventh place. He now has 71 points in the drivers’ standings, eleven behind leader Wehrlein. Sims worked his way up from 22nd on the grid to complete the race in 15th position. Victory went to Oliver Rowland (GBR, Nissan). In the Challenge Grid race, Siggy celebrated a dominant victory from pole position and extended his lead in the drivers’ standings. He now has a total of 102 points. The second driver for BMW i Andretti Motorsport this time was the well-known sim racer Cem Bolukbasi (TUR). He secured 15th place. Reactions to Round 5: Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, race result: 7th place, overall standings: 71 points): “After qualifying and the start here, I was actually in a good position to reach the podium, but in my opinion it was an overly harsh action that cost me the race. My car nearly overturned after the collision with Pascal Wehrlein and it was severely damaged. Finishing seventh and scoring some championship points was the best I could do in that situation. It was damage limitation.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, race result: 15th place, overall standings: 1 point): “It was nice to drive in Berlin this time. I felt more at home here than on other circuits and I had a lot of fun. Unfortunately, my speed is still not that good but my driving was more consistent this time and I improved by a few places. Just like in Hong Kong recently, I struggled again with some of the settings on my simulator. That is another consequence of my lack of experience but I think I’ll have it under control for the next race.“\n"}

Mental strength is playing an increasingly important role in motorsport. It’s not enough to simply drive fast if you want to be a world-class racing driver. Being able to deliver a top performance under pressure, in unpredictable situations or over a long period is what makes a champion. Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli has set new standards with Formula Medicine when it comes to mental training. BMW Motorsport has collaborated intensively with Ceccarelli for many years now. The BMW works drivers and the BMW Junior Team benefit from his progressive training philosophy. Video: The BMW Junior Team in mental training: https:\/\/b.mw\/Mental_Training. Tuscany has been a favourite destination for the BMW works drivers for years. However, it isn’t primarily the sea, wine or good food that draws them to the coastal town of Viareggio (ITA), it is the Formula Medicine training location. Up until the current COVID-19 crisis hit, Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli and his team were the most popular port of call for some of the best racing drivers in the world, as well as many young athletes when they wanted to work on their physical and psychological strength – and will be once again after the crisis is over, because, be it medical examinations, fitness training or mental training, Formula Medicine offers a holistic programme. The main focus is on mental training. “It is totally different to what was available previously,” says Ceccarelli, explaining: “Our philosophy states that mental training is only there to optimise the performance of the brain. Many people only turn to a mental trainer when they have a problem that they want to solve. Our mental training is aimed at healthy top athletes and top racing drivers, who aren’t having any issues and just want to further optimise their brain’s performance. It is a totally different approach.” As the starting point for this new approach, Ceccarelli, who dreamed of becoming a professional racing driver in his youth and started working as a doctor in Formula 1 in 1989, followed the typical processes in motorsport. “In over 30 years in racing, I learned from engineers that objective data and its analysis are what is most important,” says Ceccarelli. “We transferred that to our mental training. We developed our own hardware and software that we can use to measure brain performance objectively. During the analysis, a driver can identify their strengths and weaknesses directly from the data, like looking in a mirror.” Three levels of mental training.However, the sober analysis of the status quo is only the first level. That is followed by the athlete’s self-awareness, which is also incredibly important. “Many of the best racing drivers in the world are characterised by a high degree of self-awareness,” said Ceccarelli, who knows the Formula 1 drivers Charles Leclerc (MON) and Daniel Ricciardo (AUS) very well and has worked with them intensively. “The best racing drivers are able to make really good assessments of themselves and are always striving to learn as much about themselves as they can. Only those who can assess themselves really well will be able to perform optimally in stressful situations. That is the key.” The third crucial point in Formula Medicine’s mental training philosophy is efficiency. Ceccarelli explained that “When you optimise an engine, you try not only to get as much power out of it as possible, but also to make it as efficient as possible. We do the same with the brain: increase performance, while keeping the energy consumption as low as possible. The more efficiently the brain works, the more powerful and enduring it is under stress.” To reach the various levels, Formula Medicine uses a variety of forms of training and measurement techniques. Brain performance is recorded alongside exercises in concentration, coordination and response. Flexibility and adaptability of the brain is also trained. “If, for example, the weather changes quickly on a race weekend, the driver must be able to mentally adjust to the new conditions within a short period of time,” said Ceccarelli. Alexander Sims has benefitted from mental training.One BMW works driver who Ceccarelli has worked with intensively in preparation for the current season is BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver Alexander Sims (GBR). After a few years in GT racing, he joined the ABB FIA Formula E Championship at the end of 2018 and initially found some difficulty in adapting to the totally new requirements of the race series. “Alexander made great progress preparing for his second Formula E season,” said Ceccarelli. “He was already a top driver before he worked with us. We simply showed him ways he could make even better use of his talent.” The provisional result is that Sims started the first two races of the current Formula E season from pole position, celebrated a win and is currently third in the driver’s standings. “Formula Medicine is a fantastic place to be completely honest about your own performance and to work together constructively on improvements,” said Sims. “There wasn’t one specific measure that particularly helped me, it was more a few different levers that we adjusted to enable me to cope even better with the unique stressful situations in Formula E.” Sims is talking about the tools that the mental training gives him to be able to react better to increasing pressure than he did before. “It could be simply sitting on a chair and clearing my head, or very gentle physical exercises that help me get rid of the adrenaline.” Teamwork is also a significant aspect in the work of Formula Medicine. In the run-up to the current Formula E season, Sims was in Viareggio along with his driver colleague Maximilian Günther (GER) and the chief engineer at BMW i Andretti Motorsport, Valentino Conti. “It was the first time that I had an engineer with me. It was really interesting, and was also very useful for us from my point of view,” said Sims. “I was impressed by how strong he was in some of the mental tests, much stronger than us drivers. It was really valuable going through the processes together, and growing together as a stronger team.” BMW Junior Team spent two months at Formula Medicine.BMW Junior Team’s two-month training camp at the start of the year also followed this ethos. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) underwent intensive physical and mental preparations for their first race appearances, lived in a shared house and grew together as a team. “The lads were open to our philosophy from the start and were willing to work hard on themselves,” said Ceccarelli. “These are the best conditions for working successfully with Formula Medicine so I’m pleased that all three drivers completed the training camp with a great deal of enthusiasm and also grew together as a real BMW Junior Team on a personal level.” Developing talented young drivers is particularly close to Ceccarelli’s heart because mental training can help them tap into their potential at a much earlier stage of their career. “Usually a racing driver reaches optimum mental maturity at 27 or 28,” said Ceccarelli. “Our goal is for our training to help young drivers reach this maturity by the age of 20 or 21.” The Juniors were impressed by the training camp: “Personally, what I found most useful was learning how to assess myself better,” said Hesse. “I’m already amazed how much I’m able to make use of what I learned while I’m running, doing weight training or am in the racing simulator. I have no doubt that this will also be the case later on when we are able to get back to real racing.” Harper agreed: “As I was unaware of mental training before, I really made great progress. Even now, as we are at home and cannot train in Viareggio, we are having online sessions, which really help me to stay in good shape both physically and mentally.” Verhagen said: “When I came to Formula Medicine, I soon learned that the brain is like a muscle, which has to be trained regularly.” It is not only the BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers and BMW Junior Team who regularly take a trip to Viareggio. Formula Medicine has also become a second training home for the DTM and IMSA drivers, as well as for the BMW GT drivers. As soon as the current situation permits, no doubt the next trips to Dr. Ceccarelli and his team will follow.\n"}

As head engineer, he now looks after the race outings of the BMW M6 GT3 and the development of the new BMW M4 GT3.

During his time as a racing driver, Jeroen den Boer (NED) used to drive BMW Motorsport GT3 cars. As head engineer, he now looks after the race outings of the BMW M6 GT3 and the development of the new BMW M4 GT3. In the current COVID-19 crisis, den Boer has returned to the cockpit – virtually, at least. He has discovered sim racing and regularly competes in the BMW M8 GTE and the BMW Z4 GT3. The combination of former racing driver, BMW Motorsport engineer and sim racer make him the perfect person to analyse the similarities and differences between sim racing and real motorsport. When Jeroen den Boer competes in the BMW Z4 GT3 on the iRacing Esports platform, it feels to him like turning back the clock. Between 2011 and 2013, the Dutchman used to drive that car for the DB Motorsport team against a top-class field in the ADAC GT Masters, claiming two victories in 36 races. At the same time, he was also studying engineering, and when GT3 racing became too expensive for him and his private team, he instead went down the engineer career path. “I established some good contacts through GT3 racing, and it was through this that I ultimately arrived, via Schubert Motorsport, at BMW Motorsport,” said den Boer. “I have been working there since 2014.” In his position of responsibility, he is always there when the BMW M6 GT3 competes in major 24-hour races and the Intercontinental GT Challenge. His latest project is the development of the BMW M4 GT3, the new flagship in the BMW M Customer Racing range. While den Boer is waiting to resume his real motor racing projects, he has discovered sim racing. He now has his own equipment at home and meets with the likes of BMW works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT) and Jens Klingmann (GER) for training sessions. “I once switched on to a session on the Nordschleife. It was great fun and very interesting,” said den Boer, “particularly for me as an engineer, as there were also professional sim racers involved, who had the right answer to any questions I had regarding set-up. All of a sudden, I was no longer the engineer giving information on settings – the tables had turned. That was like a different world for me at first.” Den Boer has also gained race experience at the wheel of the virtual BMW M8 GTE and BMW Z4 GT3 in recent months. Not only were his skills as a driver put to the test, but also as an engineer, as you do everything yourself on iRacing – be that set-up, race tactics, or tyre strategy. Set-up work in the simulator and reality.“In the simulator, you can really configure everything that could occur in reality: chassis, aerodynamics, tyre pressure - everything,” den Boer explained. “As a rule, the set-up is completely open, so you can configure an incredible number of parameters. That is not so easy, and you have to know what you are doing.” Den Boer knows exactly what he is doing when it comes to real set-up work. He and his team generally start with a basic set-up, which is created using either last year’s data or, in the case of new circuits, data from similar racetracks. “Then we work together with the driver to identify the problems we need to work on,” said den Boer. “Oversteer? Understeer? Poor on the brakes? We compare the feedback from the drivers with our data. If they correspond, we change the respective settings on the car to solve the issue. That way, step by step, we are able to move in the right direction.” Understanding and correctly interpreting feedback from the drivers is one of the key skills of an engineer. That is where den Boer benefits from his own past as a racing driver. “Sometimes three words are sufficient, and I know what they mean. I think I can empathise with them,” he said. There is no need for him to do that when performing set-up work in the simulator, as he is both driver and engineer at the same time. “In my case, the set-up work in the simulator is possibly quicker, as I am the driver and, even whilst behind the wheel, I can already be considering what set-up changes I am going to try next,” explained den Boer. “I don’t need to chat to another driver beforehand and attempt to put his evaluations into practice.” Instead, he could theoretically call on his knowledge gained in real motor racing and, for example, use a real basis set-up for the simulation. “It’s not that simple,” says den Boer, putting it into perspective. “I may know from experience which screws to tighten first, should I have a problem with the set-up – but to use a basis set-up 1:1 would not work.” Race strategy and data analysis are virtually identical.As with the set-up, work on the race strategy is virtually identical in the simulator and in reality, as den Boer explained with a practical example: “I drove a four-hour race on the Nordschleife with a colleague. We had to discuss tactics, calculate fuel consumption and determine the tyre strategy – it was great fun. We had calculated that the leader would cross the finish line before the race time elapsed, which meant we still had to do another lap. With that in mind, we put more fuel in, which allowed us to overtake a few cars that had run out of fuel on Döttinger Höhe at the end of the race. The engineer in me definitely came through that time.” In terms of data analysis, the parallels between sim racing and real motorsport are equally startling. “As you can in reality, you can superimpose and analyse the telemetry data of different drivers,” said den Boer. “Where am I braking too soon or too late? Where must I select a different gear? This data is identical to reality. You can even use the same programme for the data analysis. That is really cool.” When simulation is so close to reality, could it be an idea to take the set-up ideas from a virtual car and transfer them to a real race car? “You have to be very careful there,” said den Boer. “If you are wrong, you cannot simply hit restart and try again on the real racetrack. The car is broken.”\n"}

BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers Maximilian Günther (GER) and Alexander Sims (GBR) were unable to score any points in the fourth race of the season in the ‘ABB Formula E Race At Home Challenge’ on the virtual circuit in Hong Kong (CHN). After two wins and one third-place finish, Günther was forced to withdraw early this time after a crash at the start and another accident during the race. Sims also had to retire his BMW iFE.20. In the Challenge Grid race, Team Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) reached the podium for the fourth consecutive time in BMW i Andretti Motorsport colours, defending his lead in the overall standings. Günther qualified in fourth place for the Formula E drivers’ race but endured a poor start, having to slam on the brakes after a jump start. He and Sims were then involved in a tumultuous accident in turn one. Sims headed for the pits before retiring, while Günther was able to continue. However, a drive-through penalty for the jump start and another accident saw his race come to a premature end. Victory went to Pascal Wehrlein (GER, Mahindra). Günther is now five points behind Wehrlein in second place. The 15 points secured by Siggy for finishing third in the Challenge Grid race see him defend his overall lead with a total of 76 points. This time, the second BMW iFE.20 was driven by former soldier and multiple Invictus Games medal-winner Gareth Paterson (GBR). Reactions to Round 4: Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, race result: DNF, overall standings: 65 points): “Of course, it’s a shame that I didn’t just miss out on the podium for the first time this season, but failed to score any points at all. Unfortunately, I made a mistake at the start and moved forward too early. Things then got chaotic in turn one, but I made it through somehow. My drive-through penalty put me so far back that I had to risk everything to try and score some points, but then I hit the wall and was forced to retire from the race.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, race result: DNF, overall standings: 1 point): “To be honest, that was a dreadful race. I didn’t do well in the rain in qualifying, which meant I had to start way back. Then multiple cars suddenly appeared together right in front of me in turn one. I had no chance of avoiding them and my car was badly damaged. I headed to the pits for repairs, but I was then so far behind that I retired immediately.”\n"}

After recording two victories to start the IMSA iRacing Pro Series, Bruno Spengler (CAN) followed up his sixth-place finish in Mid-Ohio (USA) with a return to the podium on the virtual circuit at Road America (USA). A bold tyre strategy helped the Canadian driver to cross the line second in the BMW M8 GTE. Philipp Eng (AUT) was right behind him in third place. A total of six BMW M8 GTEs reached the top ten. Victory went to Nick Tandy (GBR, Porsche). The BMW drivers were unable to finish ahead of the competition from Porsche and Ford in the qualifying session on the historic circuit but improved during the race thanks to a cohesive performance. Spengler and John Edwards (USA) were the only drivers to use their pit stops to change just two tyres instead of four, a decision which enabled them to make up a few places. Spengler took good care of his tyres during the final phase and claimed a podium position. Edwards was the third-best BMW driver, finishing in fifth position. Turner Motorsport drivers Robby Foley (USA), Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Nick Catsburg (NED) crossed the finish line in seventh, eighth and ninth places. Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW M8 GTE, BMW IMSA Team Red, 2nd place): “We knew in advance that competing against such strong opposition would be tougher on this circuit than in previous races. The qualifying results in particular confirmed that. However, choosing a pit stop strategy of just changing the left-hand tyres with the heavier wear allowed us to make decisive progress. The older tyres did not have a detrimental effect on the pace towards the end and I was able to keep hold of second place All in all, it was a great day and a super result for me and the entire team.” Philipp Eng (#26 BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team Austria, 3rd place): “With that fourth place in Mid-Ohio and third place here, things are going very well for me but that should not come as a surprise. I have been training unbelievably hard for this race. It involves a crazy amount of work for the entire team and all the drivers. We work really well together on the set-up and driving style. I was ahead of Bruno before the pit stop – and on reflection, if I could reverse the decision to change all four tyres, I would, but everything is always clearer with hindsight. Nonetheless, it was a great performance from all of us. Finishing with a total of six BMW M8 GTEs in the top ten is an excellent result.”\n"}

Her research looks into how humans negotiate their evolving relationship with machines that may ultimately surpass human limitations. Steeped in the latest digital technologies, Lu employs sophisticated motion-capture devices to record dancer’s gestures, including facial, finger- and eye-capture techniques that can collect and analyze the subtlest body movements, and mimic these using robotic technologies.“To me, there is no distinction between art and technology, robots and our bodies are both carriers. They are both substances. Buddhism refers to the physical world as a world of matters. From a macro point of view, arts, culture, technology, tradition, and modernity all belong to the same system. This way of thinking is less limiting”, says Lu Yang about her work.In Bali, Lu met traditional Balinese dancers as well as kEnkEn, a renowned dancer from Tokyo (Japan). In Balinese dances, movement is controlled to such a degree that dancers are able to manipulate their finger joints individually. Lu was able to capture dance motion data from famous dancing actor I Wayan Purwanto, Legong dancer Ni Kadek Sudarmanti, Rangda dancer Made Sukadana, as well as from the warrior dancer Dewa Putu Selamat Raharja. The four sets of captured motion are highly representative for Indonesian dance traditions.With the support of the Japan Foundation, PARCO in Tokyo, and the Tokyo based company Akar Media, Lu invited kEnkEn, a celebrated young dancer, to join her in Bali. In collaboration with him, Lu was able to collect data of kEnkEn’s facial and body gestures.The facial micro-expressions and action data of the dancers will be used in the final artwork, which Lu will create after the BMW Art Journey. Lu has been using motion-capture technology to create her artistic work for the past two to three years. With the BMW Art Journey, the artist has the opportunity to develop her work and gather more detailed facial expressions and finger movements of the dancers.The technological requirements of Lu Yang´s BMW Art Journey made the preparations complex, especially in regards to the need of using advanced technology. The creation of top-notch virtual and digital human and facial micro-expression is one of the greatest challenges of the project. Lu Yang´s team spent several months conducting research globally for potential partners in this area. The team decided to partner with “facegood”, from China, as they possess the most advanced patent technology in China to capture facial micro-expression. Their technology is capable of capturing facial expressions and body actions on the spot and they will be responsible for the postproduction, in which virtual digital human renderings will be created with matching action data.The second leg of Lu Yang´s BMW Art Journey will take the artist to Kerala in India.For further information about the artists and her BMW Art Journey, please visit:www.bmw-art-journey.comArt Basel and BMW collaborate with the artist to document the journey and will share it with a broader public through print publications, online and social media.About Lu YangLu Yang (b. 1984) is a Shanghai-based multi-media artist, who graduated from the New Media Art Department of the China Academy of Art. Deeply immersed in the subcultures of anime, video games, and Science-Fiction, the output of her artistic practice spans 3D-animated films, video game installations, holograms, neon, VR and software manipulation, often with overt Japanese manga and anime references. Her work was displayed in exhibitions at Kulturforum, Berlin; Centre Pompidou, Paris; M Woods, Beijing; Shanghai Biennale; and Athens Biennale.Lu Yang was announced as the next BMW Art Journey winner during Art Basel in Basel in 2019.

And that is precisely why the first all-electric model of the British premium brand cuts a particularly striking appearance in the desert city.  ->","completion":" Glitz and glamour, gambling and gigantic shows – everything is larger than life in the entertainment metropolis of Las Vegas. And that is precisely why the first all-electric model of the British premium brand cuts a particularly striking appearance in the desert city. The small car only needs a modest footprint to park, it buzzes quietly along the world-famous Las Vegas Strip and in the permanently neon-soaked hotel and casino landscape it only needs precisely the amount of electricity that is necessary for the driving fun that is so typical of the marque. Munich\/Las Vegas. This is a city with a magic glow where replicas of the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Egyptian pyramids and Venetian canals form backdrops for spectacular hotel and casino buildings. Elvis doubles welcome you on every street corner, and Las Vegas itself can easily take on an otherworldly aspect owing to its location in the middle of the Nevada Desert. The fact is that the imitations of famous sights on Las Vegas Boulevard – familiar to everybody simply as the “Strip” – attract more tourists every year than each of the originals. And there have always been illusionists in the show arenas like David Copperfield, Siegfried & Roy or Hans Klok, who hold a magic attraction for public audiences. In the casino and entertainment metropolis, everything is larger than life and more spectacular than anywhere else. This also applies in the street. Where super-long stretch limousines, exclusive sports cars and pick-ups with muscular engines meld into everyday experiences, only a truly awesome automobile is capable of generating the wow factor. For example, an all-electric small car from the United Kingdom. And it’s a fact: In Las Vegas, the new MINI Cooper SE is a truly exotic machine with high emotional appeal.Anybody buzzing down the “Strip” in the MINI Electric while generating zero local emissions turns heads in astonishment and gets lots of thumbs-ups. The city’s most famous boulevard is almost seven kilometres long and charts its course from north to south. Lines of hotels with sonorous names like “Venetian”, “Mirage”, “Flamingo”, “Caesars Palace”, “Bellagio”, “MGM Grand”, “New York, New York” or “Luxor” lead the way to the equally famous welcome sign with the immortal words “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” to offer yet another photo opportunity. When cruising down the “Strip”, the fabulous MINI Cooper SE amazes passers-by with snappy but almost soundless bursts of acceleration. The journey from one traffic light to the next represents an ideal opportunity to make use of the two-stage brake energy recovery. Depending on the volume of traffic, each of the two toggle settings has its own distinctive appeal. If you toggle to strong recuperation, the MINI Electric is aggressively decelerated as soon as the driver releases the accelerator pedal. This mode channels a particularly large amount of energy back into the high-voltage battery. In the other mode, the car rolls to a stop at a leisurely pace and with reduced braking action.When night falls in Las Vegas, the facades, advertising hoardings, direction signs and floodlights form a multicoloured, flashing and dazzling ocean of neon tubes and LED modules. However, the city council of Las Vegas is doing all it can to reduce the consumption of resources. All public buildings now generate their electricity from renewable sources. And charging stations for electric vehicles are easy to find. The MINI Electric recharges its batteries so as to be ready for the outing on the coming day.“What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas”, is a famous saying among visitors that promises discretion. But in the era of social-media livestream, it’s pretty much impossible to stop the occasional embarrassing fact being leaked to the outside world. More and more tourists are also keen to explore the attractions in the environs of the city. Just 30 kilometres away from the “Strip”, Red Rock Canyon at sunrise presents a wonderful play of colours on the shimmering rock formations clothed in a red glow.Soon afterwards it gets really hot. If there happened to be some shadow somewhere on the desert roads, the thermometer would be indicating around 50 degrees Celsius there. Under the burning sun, the temperature is even higher. Any mobile phone battery will soon run out of juice when subjected to these conditions. By contrast, the high-voltage battery of the new MINI Cooper SE remains “cool”. The range is between 235 and 270 kilometres with a fully-charged battery, and it only comes down very gradually. This is made possible by an extremely effective all-in cooling system for the interior and the high-voltage battery. Thanks to highly efficient heat-pump technology, the cooling system runs like a dream into the bargain. It also permits pre-conditioning of the interior. After going hiking at Red Rock Canyon, the driver of the MINI Electric is in for a truly enviable treat because a refreshingly pre-cooled car awaits the driver’s return. The remote app for MINI Connected even allows the pre-conditioning to be activated remotely – provided the all-important smartphone has not lost its charge in the heat.Another popular excursion takes visitors to the Hoover Dam located around 50 kilometres to the south-east of Las Vegas. The Mike O’Callaghan – Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge takes Highway 93 across the Colorado River and the canyon it has carved out of the rocks, providing a fascinating view of the monumental dam across the valley. It blocks the river to Lake Mead and supplies Las Vegas with drinking water. 17 turbines also harness the power of the water to generate electricity. Powerful electromagnetic waves occur near the dam as a side effect of the zero-emission energy generation. These waves encourage the development engineers of the BMW Group to divert to the Hoover Dam on their test drives through Death Valley with prototypes of new models, in order to put the ruggedness of the electronic vehicle systems through its paces. Tests like this have significantly improved the electromagnetic shielding over recent decades. As a consequence, the onboard electronics of the MINI Cooper SE remain distinctly unimpressed during the trip over the dam, while the occupants are once again unable to take their eyes off this man-made spectacle.\n"}

When the motor racing season resumes, a familiar face will make his comeback on the BMW S 1000 RR: Ian ‘Hutchy’ Hutchinson (GBR). The 16-time TT winner returns to the TAS Racing team, with Team Principal Philip Neill, with whom he will compete in international road races and the British championship under the new banner of SYNETIQ BMW Motorrad. The project is being supported by BMW Motorrad Motorsport. Hutchinson, BMW Motorrad Motorsport, BMW S 1000 RR and TAS Racing proved to be a successful combination back in 2016 and 2017. “I am delighted to have Ian back in the family,” said BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director, Marc Bongers. “He has enjoyed great success with us in the past. We would obviously have liked this announcement to have been a little more spectacular, and to have had Ian in his leathers on the bike and competing in the North West 200 and the Isle of Man TT. However, we will have to put that on hold for now.” “I enjoyed my previous spell with TAS Racing on the BMW S 1000 RR,” said Hutchinson. “Now that I’ve secured a deal to return to the TAS team with Philip Neill at SYNETIQ BMW, I’m really looking forward to getting going again.” Team Principal Neill added, “I honestly thought our racing days with Ian had come to an end after our successful partnership through 2016\/17. However, we are clearly delighted that Ian was not only available but extremely keen on a return to TAS Racing. People may differ in their opinions on the various riders but one thing everyone can agree on is the utter determination shown by Hutchy time and time again. It never ceases to amaze me the amount of dedication and effort the man puts into his preparation for racing, and for that reason he is the perfect man to lead SYNETIQ BMW into this new chapter of our racing journey.” A road racing legend. Hutchinson enjoys legendary status on the international road racing scene. He laid the foundation for this in 2010 when he became the first rider ever to win all five individual races at the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy – the first time in the history of the classic event, which stretches back over 100 years, that anybody had achieved the feat. However, fate turned against him just a few days later when ‘Hutchy’ severely injured his left leg in a crash in the British championship. It looked as though his career was over. Hutchinson bounced back, returned to racing, and overcame yet more setbacks. Although he broke his left leg again in 2012, he fought his way back into the sport’s elite. He made a much-acclaimed comeback at the Macau Grand Prix in 2013. Hutchinson’s first race back after another injury lay-off was at the infamous ‘Guia Circuit’ – and he promptly marked his comeback with a victory. “He is a legend,” Bongers confirmed. “I experienced that for myself for the first time in Macau in 2013. The award ceremony took place on the Sunday evening. First to receive their trophies were all the car drivers. They all came up to the podium in their smart-casual outfits and were politely applauded. Then came the motorcyclists, and so on, until Ian Hutchinson was called up to receive his trophy. He was sitting relatively far back in that big hall, and still was not particularly quick on his feet. He was given a standing ovation – all the way, as he slowly made his way to the podium and back – from every person, every team, whether automobile or motorbike, and regardless of brand. Even when I tell the story now, so many years later, it still gives me goosebumps.” Success with the BMW S 1000 RR. Hutchinson joined the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family in 2016 and competed for TAS Racing in road races and the Superstock class of the British Superbike Championship. Right at the start of the season, Hutchinson won the Superstock race at the North West 200 on his BMW S 1000 RR. Next was the Isle of Man TT, at which he not only won the Superstock TT, but also set a new Superstock lap record. Hutchinson claimed no fewer than three victories on the RR at the 2016 Ulster Grand Prix and set a new world record when he topped the 134-mph mark in the event’s second Superbike race. In setting an average speed of 134.089 mph, he was crowned the ‘World’s Fastest Road Racer’. ‘Hutchy’ was no less successful at the racetrack that year. He won two races and claimed a total of nine podium finishes in the Superstock class of the BSB. Hutchinson was one of the favourites for the title, despite missing a round that clashed with his road racing commitments. “For a road racer the TT is the main goal and we won there,” Hutchinson explained looking back. “But we did the same at the North West 200 and also took three wins in a day at the Ulster Grand Prix. That day at Dundrod included earning the accolade of world’s fastest road racers with a 134mph lap. We took Superstock wins on the TAS Racing prepared BMW S 1000 RR at all three major internationals in 2016 and we also got that all-important Superbike win to finish the season on a high.” As well as those successes, another thing stands out in BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Bongers’ memories of that 2016 season: “It was in the Superstock race on the Isle of Man, when he set the lap record. Back then, his lap – from a standing start – was only a few seconds slower than Peter Hickman when he subsequently set his new Superbike lap record on a flying lap. That was extremely impressive – a highlight.” At the 2017 Isle of Man TT, Hutchinson first won the Superbike race, before claiming a dominant victory in the Superstock race. He was also one of the hot favourites in the Senior TT, and was looking to get his third win of the week. Unfortunately, however, he crashed and fractured his left femur. That resulted in another break from racing, but ‘Hutchy’ once again fought back. “It is remarkable how determined and motivated he is, not just to come back and compete, but to challenge for victories,” said Bongers. A strong future together. Hutchinson was back in action on the BMW S 1000 RR last November, when he appeared at the 2019 Macau Grand prix for Shaun Muir’s Milwaukee with SMT team. “The preparation time was extremely short, and you only have a very limited amount of riding time in practice in Macau. For that reason, we did not have particularly good results,” said Bongers. Hutchinson now returns to the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family as a rider for SYNETIQ BMW Motorrad, and Bongers is certain that they can add to the success story together. “He feels right at home on our package. We have also modified our BMW S 1000 RR so that we have the gears on the right side. He has already ridden at a few tests and is still extremely quick. I am confident that he is a podium contender at the road races. And if we have enough time to test – which will hopefully be the case – then he can certainly challenge for the top step of the podium in Macau.” And what expectations does Hutchinson have? “I enjoyed working with the whole team. It was a good relationship. The same core people are still there, so I see no reason why we cannot pick up from where we left off,” he said. “Having prepared so well in January and February I’m ready to race as soon as it is possible again.” You can find an exclusive in-depth interview with Hutchinson in the new TAS Racing e-magazine ‘Full Gas’: www.synetiqbmw.com\/fullgas\n"}

In the third BMW SIM 120 Cup race of the season on the virtual Nürburgring (GER), two more drivers secured their tickets to participate in the BMW SIM Live Event at the end of the year. Laurin Heinrich and Alexander Voß (both GER) celebrated victory in the #089 BMW M8 GTE, claiming prize money of 1,200 US dollars each. After two hours of racing, second place went to Kay Kaschube and Nils Koch (GER), who completed the one-two result for the BS+COMPETITION team and won 600 US dollars each. In a repeat of events at the fourth race in the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO a few weeks ago, the order in which the team-mates would finish only became clear on the final lap. Maximilian Benecke (GER) and Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen (NED) from Team Redline finished in third place. BMW works drivers Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT) claimed 16th place for ZF BMW Team. The BMW SIM 120 Cup on the Nürburgring Grand Prix circuit featured 46 teams competing just in the top split. This saw the drivers with the best overall ratings battling for victory on the iRacing platform in a competition that featured Romain Grosjean (FRA) as the second Formula 1 driver alongside Verstappen. There were more races within the race, referred to as splits. The BMW Junior Team appeared in one of these splits for starters with lower ratings. Dan Harper (GBR) and Neil Verhagen (USA) shared a BMW M8 GTE, while Max Hesse (GER) enjoyed the support of former BMW Motorsport Junior and current BMW works driver Erik Johansson (SWE). Heinrich and Voß were able to secure pole position after a close-fought qualifying session in the top split. They were able to defend thar position until just a few minutes from the end. However, Voß then had to let Koch pass in the #7 BMW M8 GTE after sliding out. Koch then received a ‘slow down’ penalty after putting all four wheels off the track when driving through the NGK chicane for the penultimate time. That allowed Voß to pull level with his team-mate once again and regain the lead on the first turn of the final lap of the race. The result means that Voß and Heinrich are the third duo to confirm their participation in the BMW SIM Live 2020 event. Benecke, Maximilian Wenig (GER), Josh Rogers (AUS) and Mitchell deJong (USA) had already booked their BMW SIM 120 Cups tickets at Daytona and Sebring (both USA). Spengler secured a superb sixth place on the grid for the #25 BMW M8 GTE from the ZF BMW team. However, he was then involved in two collisions early in the race, which pushed him back down the field and damaged his car. Eng took over driving duties at the halfway point of the race, crossing the finishing line in 16th place. In addition to the two BMW works drivers, Beitske Visser (NED) was also competing in the main race. Driving alongside Florian Woithe (GER), she crossed the line in 31st place for the Williams JIM Esports team. As the year progresses, three further BMW SIM 120 Cup races will give drivers the opportunity to secure their places on the grid for BMW SIM Live 2020. They will take place at the circuits of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL, 5th July), Road Atlanta (USA, 20th September) and Interlagos (BRA, 8th November). Reactions to the BMW SIM 120 Cup at the Nürburgring: Alexander Voß (#089 BMW M8 GTE, BS+COMPETITION, 1st place): “My heart was really racing when I made that error just before the end but then Nils made a similar mistake in the same chicane and I was able to get past and claim the victory. I am delighted to be competing at BMW SIM Live. That is much more important to us than the prize money. We worked really well with our team-mates Kay and Nils during preparations for this race and we found the perfect set-up.” Laurin Heinrich (#089 BMW M8 GTE, BS+COMPETITION, 1st place): “Claiming that ticket for BMW SIM Live is also the most important aspect of today’s win for me. I finished second at last year’s finale, just missing out on the win, which means I have some unfinished business with the event. Just like in the last DNLS race, the final phase of this event was really dramatic for us and our team-mates. Alexander reacted very well after his incident to prevent a 360-degree spin. That meant that he only lost a few seconds and was able to regain first place at the finish.” Philipp Eng (#25 BMW M8 GTE, ZF BMW Team, 16th place): “Firstly, congratulations to our team-mates from BS+COMPETITION on their one-two result in such a competitive race. Bruno also deserves praise for beating so many professional sim racers in qualifying to claim sixth place on the grid. Unfortunately, those early incidents in the race put paid to any chances we may have had of securing a top finish. The race went well for me after the car had some quick repairs during the pit stop. However, 16th place was the best we could do. As mentor for the BMW Junior team, I am also happy that the guys were able to compete against some strong competition in their split to gain some more experience.” Bruno Spengler (#25 BMW M8 GTE, ZF BMW Team, 16th place): “My qualifying lap was really great. It felt good to claim sixth place when competing against some of the best sim racers in the world but it was an unbelievably close-run thing. Just one or two tenths of a second slower would have seen me in 15th. The level of competition in the BMW SIM 120 Cups really is unbelievably high. We had a perfect set-up for our BMW M8 GTE. Congratulations to BS+COMPETITON on their win. Unfortunately, I was hit from behind twice during the race and the car suffered quite a bit of damage. When you consider everything that happened to us, we can be pretty pleased with finishing 16th. In any case, it was great fun.”\n"}

Just as a real racing driver needs a customised cockpit to be successful, the right hardware is also required in sim racing if you want to compete at the highest level. The range on offer is huge – from simple basic equipment, which any amateur gamer can pick up, to high-end solutions. BMW drivers Philipp Eng (AUT) and Christian Krognes (NOR), and sim racers Laurin Heinrich and Alexander Voß (both GER) give an overview of what is on offer and reveal that the most expensive equipment does not necessarily guarantee the fastest lap times. Sim rig, force feedback, direct drive and widescreen are meaningful terms to those heavily involved in sim racing. They are just some of the hardware components that can be used in virtual races at the highest level of the discipline. Essentially, a high-end kit consists of a solid and stable metal frame, in which the racing seat is integrated – the so-called sim rig. As a rule, a rig like this also includes a screen – preferably a high-resolution one. A steering wheel with appropriate engine and a set of pedals are also obligatory. This kind of equipment is currently allowing the likes of BMW works driver Philipp Eng to regularly take to the track in virtual BMW race cars, like the BMW M8 GTE in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series and the BMW Z4 GT3 in the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO with great success. Just a few weeks ago he won the iRacing 24h Nürburgring powered by VCO – the biggest success of his sim racing career so far. That career began at the age of 17, when he modified a racing simulator on his desk at home. “I shifted the schoolbooks to one side, clamped my steering wheel to the desk, fixed the pedals to the floor – and I was ready,” Eng recalled. Nowadays, his requirements are a little more sophisticated. “In my opinion, a stable rig that does not wobble is important. I also attach great importance to ensuring that the seat position is as close as possible to what it would be in a real race car,” said Eng. “However, the most important thing for me is a good steering wheel motor. In a static simulator, the steering wheel is the only connection I have with the track. Only through the force feedback am I able to feel how the car moves – not through my whole body, as I can in reality. Another thing that helps is the so-called direct drive, with which the virtual steering column leads directly into the engine, just like in a real race car. That results in the steering wheel reacting far more directly.” Voß: “It is worth spending more than half your budget on a good rig and good pedals”.Top sim racers Laurin Heinrich and Alexander Voß from the BS+COMPETITION team, who won the virtual 24-hour race on the Nordschleife alongside Eng, are real experts when it comes to equipment. On the topic of hardware, Voß said: “In my opinion, it is worth spending more than half your budget on a good rig and good pedals if you are looking to get top equipment.” His direct drive steering wheel is homemade, as that technology was not for sale when he received it seven years ago. Heinrich went a slightly different way in this regard. “I don’t have a homemade steering wheel. Instead, I recently bought a new direct drive model. I use a DTM-style steering wheel, because I am most comfortable with that.” Like Eng, both sim racers have a 49-inch widescreen monitor with 144 hertz. “A monitor with a fast reaction time is extremely valuable, as it gives you a very realistic feeling of speed and is easier on your eyes,” Heinrich explained. Eng added: “The image transmission rate is hugely important for me to immediately see on the screen the movements that I can feel on the steering wheel without any delay.” Eng does not feel that the system often seen on the sim racing scene, with three screens to allow a larger field of vision, particularly laterally, is necessarily essential. “After all, I don’t look through the side window in a real race car.” What equipment do you need, to be able to compete with the best?The big question regarding hardware for sim racing is: What equipment do I need, to be able to compete with the best? Do I really need to fork out a five-figure sum for the race simulator and all the accessories? One man currently showing that this is not necessarily the case is Walkenhorst Motorsport driver Christian Krognes. He has only been heavily involved in sim racing for a few weeks and drives a BMW Z4 GT3 in the DNLS powered by VCO. Although his equipment is more of a throwback to what Eng was using when he started out aged 17, Krognes is setting impressive lap times on the virtual Nordschleife and challenging at the front of the field. “I basically sit at a normal table, on a normal chair. During the day, I work from home as usual. Then, in the evening, I fasten my steering wheel in place and drive for a few hours,” Krognes explained. His pedals are attached to a box under the table and there is no sign of a metal sim rig holding the whole construction together. That does cause the odd issue. “If I brake too hard, I sometimes slide backwards on my stool,” said Krognes. He is now considering making himself a simple rig. At what point does high-end equipment make sense?How is it possible for Krognes, despite his relatively basic equipment, to keep pace in such a strong racing series as the DNLS powered by VCO? “More expensive does not necessarily mean faster,” said Eng. “There are also a lot of professional sim racers who do not have such high-quality equipment, but still show me how it is done.” Voß agreed: “You are not automatically half a second faster, just because you have invested several thousands of euros in a good simulator. You have to get used to everything – even very basic equipment. Familiarity plays a very big role. Only when it comes to squeezing out the final few tenths of a second do I think that it is easier with good equipment. In my opinion, you can perform more consistently with good pedals and a good steering wheel, in particular. It is more intuitive.” Krognes backed him up: “I don’t think I would be significantly faster with top-quality equipment, but I would probably be more consistent. A triple stint in an endurance race can be pretty uncomfortable on a normal chair.” The good news for amateur racers is that you can get hold of hardware to be competitive in sim racing, with a manageable budget. Only if you are spending many hours a day at the wheel, or need to find the final few tenths of a second at the very highest level, does it make sense to invest in high-end equipment. Eng, Heinrich and Voß will be doing just that when back in action at the virtual Nürburgring this Sunday. This time, however, they will not be on the Nordschleife but the Grand Prix Circuit.

Fitness training plays a major role in the everyday life of BMW works drivers, particularly in the off-season and the current situation. As well as training alone at home, they now also have the opportunity to regularly fine-tune their fitness together - online. That is because Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli and his team at Formula Medicine are offering a special group training session via video conference three times a week for the BMW works drivers, a service that is being embraced. “We had never tested this before but we had the idea due to the current situation and it works very well,” said Dr. Ceccarelli. “Everyone is very professional and they do their exercises, but it’s extra motivation to train live together with the others and to give the very best. It’s fun to train together and to see each other on video, so it’s not only physical training, it’s also great team building.” The BMW works drivers do not need a lot of equipment for the digital training sessions, which last about one hour. They train using their own body weight – all they need is a mat for the floor. For each session, the people at Formula Medicine develop different training programmes for strength and endurance. The service also includes mental training via video conference. The group online training is working so well that they could continue in the future. “I always say ‘every problem can bring an opportunity’,” Dr. Ceccarelli explained. “So we are already working in our facility to implement it and to have more options to work with webcam and video conferences to maintain this after Corona. During the season, the drivers are on the road a lot but with one or two training sessions per week on free days we all can keep connected and exchanging. And if a driver for example has a question regarding a specific exercise, we can easily connect via video, no matter where he is.” The plan is to continue training anyway until the season resumes. Three times a week, the BMW works drivers and BMW Junior Team dial into the meetings from their homes and go at it full-throttle for an hour. Quotes on the Formula Medicine online training: Philipp Eng: “It is cool that we have this opportunity and, even in these times, can train both physically and mentally with Dr. Ceccarelli and his team via video conference. It is great that we have this service. Fortunately, today’s technology allows this kind of thing, and I really enjoy taking part.” Sheldon van der Linde: “It’s a really cool thing that Formula Medicine is offering us. What I found really cool about that is that when you are on video and training with your other team-mates, you always push yourself harder. That is one of the reasons why I love to do this. The other reason is that we have our awesome trainers on board and I’ve been working with them in the off season in January for a few weeks when I was there. I really enjoy working with them, we have a really good relationship and it’s great to meet them online for training now. It’s important for us to be ready when the season starts and I think with Formula Medicine on board we drivers have nothing to worry about. With them we are well on track to be as fit as possible for the season start.” Bruno Spengler: “I think Dr. Ceccarelli and his team have really come up with a great idea, to come up with a new training programme for us several times a week, and for us then to be able to work through that programme together with the other drivers online. It is great fun, as we are able to see each other, have a chat, and train together. It is fantastic to be able to train together with Dr. Ceccarelli, his team and my fellow BMW drivers – in addition to my other training.” Martin Tomzcyk: “Exceptional times demand exceptional measures – or, in this case, exceptional training methods. I think the Formula Medicine team and its leader Dr. Ceccarelli have really done a good job in that regard. Via video conference, they give us the opportunity to train at home under their guidance. We are virtually in the training facility in Italy. It is usually circuit training, which is primarily to strengthen your core muscles and improve stamina and speed. It also gives you a boost to see the others and train in a team, although everyone is alone at home. It is a nice change from the training I am currently only able to do by myself at home.” Jens Klingmann: “I think it is extremely cool that we have the technical opportunities to partake in sport together, even at a distance, although everyone is at home by themself. It is also very important that you don’t need any equipment, just a mat, as this is training using your own body weight. Anyone can get started straight away, although I must say that this training with your own body weight is extremely tiring. However, it is a great motivator because your BMW colleagues are also there and you know that you are being watched, you try even harder. We spur each other on. I find it a mega cool thing, and it would be excellent to continue after coronavirus, because you can do it absolutely anywhere. You can join in from your home, a hotel room, the beach, the paddock, a truck – everywhere. That gives us a huge amount of flexibility, as we strive to stay physically fit and keep improving.” Max Hesse (BMW Junior Team): “It is mega cool. The guys really go for it and it is really hard work. It is obviously also very motivating to exercise with the trainers and other drivers. That spurs you on a bit more and makes it a little easier to get through the training. We are using the time now to work through our training really well and are also doing mental training to ensure we are also on top form mentally by the time things resume.” Dan Harper (BMW Junior Team): “The online training sessions with Formula Medicine are great. They are very beneficial for me and I think also for all the other drivers because it’s a good way for us to keep pushing with our training. As I am in the UK at the moment I am not able to be outside for more than one hour for exercise so doing these digital work-outs with Formula Medicine with the other Juniors, Max and Neil, plus the works drivers is really pushing me forward. And it’s also big fun. For sure it’s hard work so it’s really keeping me in shape for when the season starts at the Nürburgring and it’s just a brilliant way to keep in touch with everybody and to keep our training up to where it needs to be.” Neil Verhagen (BMW Junior Team): “The online training with Formula Medicine are really tough but great. It’s nice to see everybody’s face again and I really enjoy the training. They are helpful and it’s great to interact with everybody again.” \n"}

The Board of Management of BMW AG has decided today to update its guidance for the financial year 2020. The decisive factor for the adjustment is that the measures to contain the corona virus pandemic are lasting longer in several markets and are thus leading to a broader negative impact than was foreseeable in mid-March. It is therefore apparent that delivery volumes in these markets will not – as was previously assumed - return to normal within a few weeks. The highest negative impact is expected in the second quarter of 2020. The economic shifts caused by the pandemic make it difficult to provide a reliable forecast. The outlook is therefore subject to a high degree of uncertainty. To reflect this uncertainty, the company has widened the range for the EBIT margin for the Automotive segment and now expects a range between 0% and 3%. In the Financial Services segment, the return on equity is now forecasted to fall moderately year-on-year. Motorcycles deliveries over the twelve-month period are now expected to be significantly below the previous year's level. The EBIT margin for the segment is forecasted to be within a range of between 3% and 5%. Group profit before tax is still predicted to be significantly lower than in 2019. These targets are to be achieved with a workforce slightly below the level of the previous year. As already communicated, reductions in staff numbers due to fluctuation will be used to manage the workforce size. The updated guidance does not, in particular, include, a longer and deeper recession in major markets, a more severe economic slow-down in China as a result of recessions in other parts of the world, significant market distortions due to an even stronger competitive environment and possible implications caused by a second wave of infections and associated containment measures. The BMW AG will publish further details on the outlook and the earnings figures for the first quarter of 2020 on 6 May 2020 at approximately 07:30 a.m. \n"}

This Saturday was once again dominated by sim racing for several BMW works drivers. Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT) and their respective teams ensured that the BMW Z4 GT3 recorded a one-two result in the fourth race of the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO. Shortly afterwards, both drivers switched to virtual formula race cars to make their appearance in the first round of ‘THE RACE All-Stars Series’ in which they are competing in the ProCup as the BMW Motorsport SIM Racing team. Race 4 of the DNLS powered by VCO.The fourth race of the DNLS powered by VCO, the Eibach 3-hour race on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), culminated in a dramatic finale. The main players were two BMW Z4 GT3s. After three turbulent hours of racing, packed with exciting action and an unpredictable series of events, the final kilometres proved to be spectacular. With the end of the race in sight, the field was headed by the #189 BMW Z4 GT3 from BS+COMPETITION, which had emerged victorious from the iRacing 24-hour race at the same location one week earlier. In that car, driving duties were shared by Eng and his team-mates Alexander Voß and Laurin Heinrich (both GER) however the #107 BMW Z4 GT3, driven for Team BMW Bank by their team-mates Spengler, Nils Koch and Kay Kaschube (both GER), popped up right at the death. The #107 car then took the lead. The two BMW Z4 GT3s battled for the top spot in a thrilling wheel-to-wheel duel. Despite a contact including a spin of the #189 car, they were still far enough ahead of the nearest challenger to secure the one-two result for the BMW Z4 GT3. Victory went to Spengler and Team BMW Bank, with second place claimed by Eng and BS+COMPETITION. A total of eight BMW Z4 GT3s were competing in the fourth race of the DNLS powered by VCO. The other BMW works drivers in the race were Martin Tomczyk, Jens Klingmann (both GER) and Jesse Krohn (FIN), as well as the BMW Junior Team with Max Hesse (GER), Dan Harper (GBR) and Neil Verhagen (USA). Tomczyk and Klingmann shared driving duties in the car from the H&R BMW Team Green Hell with Robby Foley (USA) for the first time. ‘THE RACE All-Stars-Series’ season-opener.Barely two hours after their success on the Nürburgring Nordschleife, Spengler and Eng were back in action at the digital version of the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia, the venue for the first round of ‘THE RACE All-Star-Series’ 2020, with a host of famous names from real motorsport and sim racing. BMW Motorsport SIM Racing is competing with its own team in the series’ ProCup, with Spengler and Eng as the driving duo for the season-opener in the competition featuring digital formula cars. Qualifying is followed by two 15-minute races, the second of which starts with the grid in reverse order. The thousands of fans watching events around the world on the livestream were treated to some turbulent sprint races featuring a large ProCup starting field of 40 participants. In race one, Spengler crossed the line in 23rd place while Eng had to retire early. Starting 14th in the second race, Spengler put on a sensational chase to secure second place on the podium after seven laps. Eng also quickly reached the top ten after starting from 16th place. However, a collision then pushed him back by five positions. In the second half of the race, Eng gradually clawed back the positions lost and finished in tenth place. Reactions to the long sim racing Saturday: Bruno Spengler: “It was a crazy day. The race on the Nordschleife was really cool. I started from eighth place and managed to move up to fifth. My team-mates Nils and Kay then did a mega job and we were able to claim victory. We are delighted with our first win in the DNLS powered by VCO. Straight after that, it was time for THE RACE. The first race didn’t go so well, as I don't have much experience there yet, but with the grid in reverse order, race two was super and second place was a great result.” Philipp Eng: “The day started off really well with the afternoon on the Nordschleife. I put in a good performance in qualifying and I secured second place on the grid. The race was great and it was superb to claim a one-two result for the team, even though there was a bit of controversy through the final turns. That sort of thing can just happen when you are battling for the win. Unfortunately, there had already been some contact with a TCR car earlier in the race and that cost us about half a minute. Without that, it would probably have turned out as quite a relaxed win for us. There wasn't much time to train for THE RACE afterwards so I’m pleased with the top ten result in the second race. It was certainly great fun.” \n"}

Maximilian Günther (GER) remains undefeated after race two of the ‘ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge’. The BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver made it two wins from two races in the BMW iFE.20, this time on the newly-programmed ‘Electric Docks’ virtual circuit. Now with 50 points to his name, he continues to lead the championship. Alexander Sims (GBR) came home 14th in the second BMW iFE.20. In the Challenge Race, Team Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) finished runner-up for BMW i Andretti Motorsport to claim another spot on the podium. That was enough to see Siggy move to the top of the overall standings with 34 points. Günther started the race from second place, avoided the numerous collisions in the narrow first chicane, and wasted little time in taking the lead. That came under threat when Pascal Wehrlein (GER, Mahindra) closed the gap and started to apply pressure to the leader. However, Wehrlein then made a mistake, which allowed Günther to claim his second win of the season without any serious challenge over the closing laps. Sims again made good progress from 17th on the grid and was in contention for a top-ten finish. An incident then saw him drop back down the field, however, and he eventually came home in 14th place. Like Günther, Siggy also started the Challenge Race from second place in a BMW iFE.20. He held that position for 15 laps and finished runner-up to claim a second podium in a row, having finished third just one week ago. That consistency has earned him the overall lead in the Challenge Race competition, in which professional sim racers and guest starters go head to head. Charlie Martin (GBR) finished 15th in the second BMW iFE.20. Reactions to Round 2: Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, race result: 1st place, overall standings: 50 points): “I am very happy to have won this race as well. The first two corners were pretty chaotic as there were quite a lot of contact. Fortunately, I came through all that unscathed and was able to take the lead after turn three. From then on, I focussed on not making any mistakes and getting the win. That was not at all easy, as it would have been very easy to crash on this new circuit. As far as I am aware, that must have happened to some of my opponents. I am delighted with the great haul of 50 points after two races.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, race result: 14th place, overall standings: 1 point): “My race was okay. I was able to set the same lap times as in practice. That is my benchmark, as I still have very little simulator experience and am not particularly quick, especially compared to my fantastic team-mate Maximilian Günther. I am happy to let him take the limelight in sim racing – congratulations on another win! I am having a huge amount of fun and am looking forward to the coming races.”\n"}

He finished fourth to round off the top-four lock-out for BMW. Having emerged victorious from the first two races, Bruno Spengler (CAN) secured pole position in Mid-Ohio in his BMW M8 GTE before leading the race until it was time to make his pit stop. Catsburg then moved into first place, defending position against Spengler and Foley. Spengler crossed the finish line in sixth place. Nick Catsburg (#10 BMW M8 GTE, BMW IMSA Team Black, 1st place): “That was an unbelievably close race. All of us front-runners had a very similar pace. That was the first time that I was able to keep up with Bruno's speed. We then took a bit more of a risk with the amount of fuel during the pit stop, which allowed us to get past Bruno, but that did mean that I had to save some fuel towards the end and hold off Robby. Thankfully I was able to do that and claim my first win of the season.” Robby Foley (#96 BMW M8 GTE, Turner Motorsport, 2nd place): “After some bad luck in the first races, things went well for me this time. I am delighted to have got the Turner Motorsport BMW M8 GTE onto the podium. I just missed out on pole position in qualifying. It was pretty close at times during the race and there was contact once or twice. In the end, Nick was just that bit faster than me.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M8 GTE, BMW IMSA Team Red, 3rd place): “The podium is a fantastic result for me as that was effectively my second real sim race. Completing so many laps to prepare for this really paid off. I tried to drive a clean race and I managed that really well. We chose the right strategy. Of course, what helped most was the fact that I started much higher up the grid than at Laguna Seca but I have to say that there was a lot of adrenaline out there. It was almost like real motor racing.” Philipp Eng (#26 BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team Austria, 4th place): “The evening really didn’t start well. I made a mistake on my decisive lap in qualifying. To be honest, having to start from 46th place was a big challenge mentally, but I did have a superfast car in the race and I progressed relatively well. The pit stop went perfectly too. That made this fantastic chase possible.

{"prompt":"Exhaustive pre-production development process for the new edition of the two-door car carried out at race tracks and other test facilities – Final touches now being added on the country roads and motorways surrounding the BMW Group’s Research and Innovation Centre in Munich – Bespoke overall concept and chassis set-up give the new model captivating sports performance. ->","completion":" Munich. The concept of sporty driving pleasure in the premium midsize segment is being redefined and will soon be available to experience in the new BMW 4 Series Coupe. Following a series of exhaustive test drives held as part of the development process to prepare it for series production, the latest incarnation of the two-door model is now embarking on the final phase of dynamic testing. After having their driving qualities honed at the winter testing centre in Arjeplog, Sweden, at the BMW Group’s test centre in Miramas in France, on the Nürburgring’s Nordschleife circuit and at various other race tracks, the prototypes are now returning to their roots: engineers will put the final touches to the chassis technology of the new BMW 4 Series Coupe on the motorways and country roads around the BMW Group’s Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ) in Munich.Like its overall vehicle concept and design, the 4 Series Coupe’s chassis technology is a more individual composition than ever before. The proportions, aerodynamic properties and weight distribution of the two-door car provide the ideal basis for a chassis set-up focussed unerringly on exhilarating dynamic performance. A direct comparison with the new BMW 3 Series Sedan highlights the new model’s unique profile particularly clearly. The sedan’s already impressively low rear-axle lift is undercut by 0.015. Plus, the new BMW 4 Series Coupe is 57 millimetres lower than its four-door counterpart and its centre of gravity is 21 millimetres closer to the road as a result.This all combines with the increased negative camber at the front wheels and the 23-millimetre wider rear track to sharpen the car’s handling characteristics by a significant degree. The sports sedan already boasts extraordinary dynamism, but the new BMW 4 Series Coupe raises agility and lateral acceleration by a sizable margin again.The development team for the new BMW 4 Series Coupe also took a model-specific approach to incorporating the chassis technology and connecting the suspension to the body. The fruits of their labours will launch the new two-door model straight to the top of its segment in terms of sporting prowess and the driving experience. At the same time, the double-joint spring strut front axle \/ five-link rear axle configuration means the dialling up of dynamic performance doesn’t come at the expense of excellent comfort on everyday drives and long journeys. Lift-related dampers – which made their debut in the new BMW 3 Series Sedan and offer continuously variable, progressive damping control as a function of spring travel – have been tuned for an even sportier drive. Custom-made tower-to-front end struts and an additional shear panel on the bulkhead optimise steering precision and response, while bracing elements have been added around the rear axle to increase stiffness for improved straightline stability and lateral acceleration.The model line-up provides another indication of the new BMW 4 Series Coupe’s unwavering commitment to class-leading driving dynamics. The range will now be spearheaded by a BMW M model in the shape of the new BMW M440i xDrive Coupe. Powered by a potent straight-six engine delivering maximum output of 275 kW\/374 hp, it will also feature 48V mild-hybrid technology, with a 48V starter-generator and a second battery employed to both ease the load on the engine and act in unison with it. Besides improved efficiency, the principal benefit here is punchier power development when the driver hits the accelerator hard. The additional 8 kW\/11 hp generated by the electric boost effect underpins lightning-fast off-the-line getaways and in-gear sprints. The engine’s stunning power delivery, the standalone vehicle concept and the optimised chassis technology’s model-specific configuration combine to endow the BMW M440i xDrive Coupe with outstanding performance credentials. Harnessing the race track expertise of BMW M GmbH, the various elements have been woven together into an overall package of supreme handling agility, precision and poise.The power generated by the engine in the new BMW M440i xDrive Coupe is channelled to the road via an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission and the car’s intelligent all-wheel-drive system. The M Sport differential is also on hand to make sure that drive power is deployed to optimum effect in demanding driving situations. The locking effect generated by an electric motor limits speed equalisation between the inside and outside rear wheel when cornering, thereby enhancing traction and handling stability while enabling the driver to power out of bends with considerable dynamic verve. The custom-tuned chassis elastokinematics, exceptionally powerful M Sport brakes and 18-inch M light-alloy wheels with mixed-size tyres are likewise contributory factors in the precisely controllable dynamics of the new BMW M440i xDrive Coupe.The final round of testing on the car’s home ground will allow the engineers to fast-track their latest findings into the fine-tuning process at the Research and Innovation Centre. The focus here is on ensuring that the dynamic performance attributes of the new BMW 4 Series Coupe crafted on race circuits can also be experienced in normal driving conditions on public roads. Whether darting along winding country routes around Munich or constantly switching between motorway and urban traffic, the new BMW M440i xDrive Coupe epitomises how the unequivocally sporty design of the body and chassis, the bespoke set-up of the steering, brakes and all-wheel-drive system, the pinpoint feedback from the dampers and the precise interventions of the chassis control systems together serve up driving pleasure that thrills and delights – day in, day out.\n"}

While the team from Melle (GER) has enjoyed great success for BMW M Motorsport at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) and in the Intercontinental GT Challenge, the ‘Green Hell’ has a very special appeal for the team. When it became apparent that real motor racing was not going to be possible for the foreseeable future, the decision to enter the world of was a logical one for team manager Niclas Königbauer. “At that moment, when it became clear, we immediately took a good look around and considered what we could do instead. After all, we are all positively mad about motorsport,” said Königbauer. “We very quickly hit upon sim racing on the Nordschleife. Esports has been on our list for a long time. However, for time reasons, it has never made it to the top of the list.” Without any major preparation or professional help from a sim racing team, Walkenhorst Motorsport assembled two teams within a short time frame. So far, they have fielded two BMW Z4 GT3s in all the races in the DNLS powered by VCO. Many of Walkenhorst Motorsport’s regular drivers take their place at the wheel of their racing simulators at home: David Pittard (GBR), Mikkel Jensen (DEN) and Christian Krognes (NOR). They are supported by sim racers Scott and Sam Michaels (both GBR), but are also investing a huge amount of time in getting up to the standard of the top sim racers who compete on the virtual Nordschleife every week. “It is incredible how much time the guys spend on their simulators and how much detailed work they invest in the set-up,” said Königbauer. Pittard added, “I did used to sim race as a hobby, but had to face the fact that I was miles behind the real sim racers when I started to get involved with Walkenhorst Motorsport. I have trained incredibly hard for the last four weeks and spent at least four to five hours a day on the simulator.” Podium already for Walkenhorst Motorsport.All that effort has paid dividends already. In the latest DNLS race, both Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW Z4 GT3s were in contention at the front of the field. In the end, Pittard, Scott and Sam Michaels made it onto the podium in second place. Jensen and Krognes were also among the front-runners for much of the race, despite not being supported by a sim racer. “In reality, we have some of the best drivers on the Nordschleife in our team,” said Königbauer. “As the simulations are now incredibly close to reality, I was confident that our guys would get up to speed relatively quickly, despite their lack of experience. For us to achieve a podium so soon was not necessarily expected.” One Walkenhorst Motorsport engineer, whose primary role ahead of the race is to discuss the right set-up and strategies with Königbauer and the drivers, has also contributed to the success. That will once again be the case this weekend, and throughout the whole season in the DNLS powered by VCO. It is not yet certain whether this may result in more outings in other racing series and BMW cars. “Our focus, when real motor racing hopefully resumes at some point, is to continue to run what we are starting now on the sim racing scene,” said Königbauer. “We are examining other options with great interest, however we must always weigh up whether they are possible without having to hand over the whole project.” Turner Motorsport puts its faith in the virtual BMW M8 GTE.While Walkenhorst Motorsport is focussing on races on the virtual Nordschleife, Turner Motorsport is taking on the digital racetracks of North America with the BMW M8 GTE. In the real world, Will Turner’s team fields the BMW M6 GT3 in the GTD class of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship and the BMW M4 GT4 in various racing series. On the sim racing scene, it currently runs a BMW M8 GTE in the team’s classic blue and yellow livery in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series, in which the circuit in Mid-Ohio (USA) hosts round three of the season this Thursday. “At Turner Motorsport, we have always looked for new ways of presenting our passion for racing, our brand and our partners,” said Turner. “As such, Esports was already on our radar before the current situation developed, as it offers great marketing opportunities at minimal costs. We have been monitoring the market for years and believe that it has not yet peaked.” Turner Motorsport’s driver line-up features youngster Robby Foley (USA) who drives a BMW M8 GTE in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series and caught the eye with pole position at the opening round of the season in Sebring (USA). “Having him on board makes our entry into sim racing both easier and more exciting,” said Turner. “He has been actively involved in Esports for years and is an excellent ambassador for Turner Motorsport, our partners and the BMW Motorsport Esports activities.” Youngster Foley working together with BMW works drivers.Foley’s next outing in the BMW M8 GTE is on Thursday. “It is fantastic to compete on equal terms against some well-known drivers and – as is the case with BMW works drivers Bruno Spengler, Philipp Eng, Jesse Krohn, Nick Catsburg, John Edwards and Connor De Phillippi – to work with them on the set-up,” said Foley. Although he is only 23 years old, he is an old-timer on the sim racing scene compared to the majority of other professional racing drivers. “I started with iRacing back in 2011, just for fun,” said Foley. “I have been taking sim racing really seriously for about a year. Since then, I have also had professional equipment at home. I approach it exactly the same way as real racing, particularly in the current situation.” In real motorsport, Foley has been working with Turner Motorsport since the 2018 season. Last year, he won the IMSA races in Mosport (CAN) and Road Atlanta (USA) alongside Bill Auberlen (USA), and finished runner-up in the GTD drivers’ championship. “The collaboration with Will Turner and his team is fantastic,” said Foley. “Turner Motorsport is always innovative and finding new ways to present itself. You can see that now in sim racing, where the team already has plans for the future. I am looking forward to everything that is still to come, whether it be in virtual or real motor racing.” Note to editors:We are aware of the current difficult situation. Despite this, however, we have decided to provide you with regular media information in the coming weeks and months. We will report on our BMW works drivers on the sim racing scene and we will also provide you with interviews and background stories, particularly dealing with technology topics within BMW Group Motorsport.\n"}

BMW Motorsport SIM Racing also has a special livery for the virtual BMW M8 GTE on iRacing. Victory and third place in the virtual 24-hour race at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife.The 24-hour race at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) is one of the highlights on the race calendar for drivers, teams and fans – and the same is true for sim racing. The ‘iRacing 24h Nürburgring powered by VCO’ is one of nine special events organised by iRacing in 2020. For 24 hours, from Saturday afternoon to Sunday afternoon, more than 1,400 teams and around 5,000 drivers, including many well-known names from real-life racing, went on a thrilling ride through the Green Hell. Due to the large number of starters, the starting field was divided into various ‘splits’, so, there were more than 20 ‘races within the race’. After an exciting 24 hours of racing, the win and third place on the podium both went to BMW works drivers in the digital BMW Z4 GT3. Eng and his team-mates Laurin Heinrich and Alexander Voss (both GER) crossed the finish line as winners after 175 laps in the BS+COMPETITION #089 BMW Z4 GT3. The trio took the lead just under four hours before the end of the race, and refused to surrender it. They had a lead of just under 30 seconds over the second-placed MAHLE RACING TEAM. The BS+COMPETITION team’s success was rounded off by Spengler and his colleagues Nils Koch and Kay Kaschube (both GER) in the BMW Z4 GT3 with the #7 car which, with third place, also secured a spot on the podium. “I’m totally exhausted, but I’m also extremely happy,” said Eng after the win. “This success is one for the books, and is perhaps one of my biggest wins in addition to my real 24-hour races. I’m fortunate to have such fantastic team-mates in Alex and Laurin. Not only are they super-fast, but they also don’t make even the smallest of mistakes. That’s more than impressive. It was the first ever 24-hour race for our team BS+COMPETITION, and we got the win at the first time of asking – I couldn’t be happier. It’s also really cool that, even in these circumstances, we still can write headlines for BMW.” “It was a superb race,” added Spengler. “I’m really thankful to my team-mates because I have learnt a great deal from them. They are so good, they drive very consistently and are just amazing on this track. Nils and Kay did a fantastic job, and the same is true of the whole team. Getting first and third place is a terrific team result. The team is still relatively young, so to bring two cars onto the podium is really special, particularly when you think how high the level is in iRacing. In the end it was all about bringing the car home and not making any stupid mistakes when you’re getting tired. It worked – it’s a fantastic result and I am very happy.” Some of the BMW works drivers will be back in action on the virtual Nürburgring-Nordschleife next weekend, in the fourth round of the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO on Saturday, 2nd May. Günther wins Pro overall standings of ‘THE RACE All-Star Cup’.Maximilian Günther celebrated two major successes, one after the other, on Saturday, starting with his win in the first championship race of the ‘ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge. After he won the test round a week ago, the BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver secured first place again on the virtual track in Hong Kong (CHN). This time he was rewarded with 25 points. He leads the overall standings after one of eight races. Just a few hours later, he took the win in the Pro-Driver overall standings of ‘THE RACE All-Star Cup’. Going into the grand final, Günther had the same number of points as Mike Epps (GBR) in first place, but in a thrilling race at the virtual Nürburgring (GER), he finished sixth, right in front of his rival, to prevail and claim the cash prize of 30,000 dollars, which he is donating to support disadvantaged and traumatised children. “What a day,” said Günther. “I came straight from the Formula E race and hardly had any time to practice for ‘THE RACE All-Star Cup’ final. I started the grand final in eighth place, but was able to take advantage of those in front of me making mistakes. I’m delighted to have finished the season as the top Pro-Driver and third in the overall standings. I’m particularly happy to have won the 30,000 dollars on behalf of the Verena Januschke foundation for disadvantaged and traumatised children.” BMW Motorsport SIM Racing thanks COVID-19 heroes with special livery.Sim racing is currently experiencing a major boom, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic making real-life motorsport impossible. With this in mind, BMW Motorsport is using the sim racing platform to thank the heroes of the current crisis by means of a special ‘Race Like A Hero’ livery. All iRacing users are now able to download this special livery for the BMW M8 GTE on the ‘Trading Paints’ platform and use it on the virtual racetrack. The livery can be downloaded at: https:\/\/b.mw\/RaceLikeAHeroLivery\n"}

Stoffel Vandoorne ahead of me obviously made a mistake so I was able to take the lead and bring it home safely. As racers, we always want to win when we are competing. It’s no different in sim racing to real racing. I think as drivers we are having a lot of fun in these events during this time when we’re unable to be at the racetrack. I hope it’s the same for the fans.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, 10th place, 1 point): “It’s a lot of fun to get an adrenaline rush again from the pressure of being embroiled in head-to-head duels with other racing drivers. I was really excited. Unfortunately I’m still lacking a fair bit of speed compared with the top drivers to get a fast lap in qualifying, but in the race I tried to stay out of everything, so I was able to move up the field quickly on the first lap. Obviously, I was a bit lucky that I didn’t get caught up in any of the accidents. It was still a good feeling finishing in tenth place. Congratulations to Maximilian on another win. He really is as strong as an ox in the simulator.”\n"}
{"prompt":"The blossoms are opening on the trees and the roof of the MINI Convertible is opening on the road. These are two clear signals showing that the yearned-for spring has finally sprung. Cherry blossom is one of the most beautiful recurring spectacles of nature and Japan is not the only place on earth where this signals the start of the season of balmy days.  ->","completion":" Munich\/Bonn. Nature is not familiar with the concept of lockdown. Even this year, the start of the cherry blossom season is once again an absolutely clear sign that spring has come – and more than ever it is the symbol of anticipation for times to come when magic moments can be celebrated together and in the open air. The new MINI Convertible Sidewalk is also a very special spring messenger. The edition model of this open-top four-seater is an open invitation to let down the soft top and capture the first rays of warm sunshine, turn your eyes skywards and admire the colourful splendour of the cherry blossom.Bonn is the perfect destination for an outing to view this natural marvel. The city’s residents and tourists alike believe that Breite Straße – Broad Street – in the one-time capital of Germany provides a wonderful opportunity to admire the pageant in white and pink. The MINI Convertible Sidewalk provides an impressive contrast in blue to the subtle display of colour in Bonn’s old town. The Deep Laguna metallic paint developed specially for the livery of this edition model is combined with matching bonnet stripes and 17-inch light-alloy Scissor Spoke 2-tone wheels, which are also a model-specific design feature.The exclusive soft-top roof of the edition model is well worth a closer look. The MINI Yours Softtop Sidewalk features an artistically woven-in arrow graphic. Naturally, the roof had been opened to the elements for the spring tour around Bonn. The electric-powered roof operates almost silently and takes just 18 seconds to open up. The first blossoms are able to fall on the anthracite-coloured seats in the exclusive MINI Yours Leather Lounge Sidewalk version where they create a brightly coloured showpiece together with the contrast stitching in Petrol and Energetic Yellow. The petrol paint effect also embellishes the door bezels and the backlit trim on the passenger side of the new MINI Convertible Sidewalk.The fascination with the subtle springtime messengers originated in Japan. Cherry blossom has been venerated there for centuries. It represents beauty and transience – since this wondrous show of natural beauty only lasts for a few fleeting weeks between the end of March and the beginning of May. Originally, the Cherry Blossom Festival was reserved for the imperial court but since the 17th century, Hanami – translated as “flower viewing” – has been celebrated by everyone in Japan.The tradition of cherry blossom festivals has now spread far beyond Asia across the ocean to North America and Europe. In Washington D.C., the friendship between Japan and the USA is commemorated in the annual Cherry Blossom Festival. In the region of Extremadura in the West of Spain, more than two million cherry trees transform the “Valle del Jerte” valley into a sea of pink and white. And in Hamburg, the Cherry Blossom Festival has celebrated the partnership with the twin city of Osaka in Japan for more than 50 years.In Bonn, a rapturous reception for the blossom is a relatively recent phenomenon. But a post on Facebook “Places to See Before You Die” about the sea of blossoms in Breite Straße and Heerstraße in Bonn created huge hype in 2012 and brought unimaginable fame to these two streets. This year is no exception and pedestrians and amateur photographers continue to delight in the boulevard of cherry trees. And why ever not? The natural show can be happily enjoyed by individuals or in groups of two, while maintaining social distancing or alternatively on a spin with the new MINI Convertible Sidewalk. \n"}

During sim races, drivers sit in their race simulators in their own homes, so in races with virtual driver changes, the driver hands the car over to his team-mate, who is located in another city, country or even on a different continent. The physical demands – apart from the g-forces – are almost as high as in real-life racing cars. In the event of an accident, the car has to return to the pit for repairs and then wait for a period that is in line with the damage before being allowed back onto the track. Race control can also award a time penalty. The special features of sim racing include pro racing-drivers from real-life motorsport being able to compete alongside professional sim racers and there is a real closeness to the fans. They can follow the action live online and via various social media channels, for example, on the BMW Motorsport Facebook and YouTube channels. The drivers also get their fans involved via their social channels and in the DNLS powered by VCO there is even a digital press conference after each race. \n"}

Sim racing in Romania? Yes, sim racing in Romania! A country that plays a supporting role in traditional racing compared to great nations such as Germany, Italy, England or France is in the fast lane in the currently booming field of sim racing. BMW Group România is Title Partner of the increasingly popular Racing League România and is helping get a real BMW legend back on the racetrack. The car in action is the most successful touring car ever built: the BMW M3 E30. Roberto Ravaglia (ITA), Johnny Cecotto (VEN), Steve Soper (GBR), Eric van de Poele (BEL), Harald Grohs (GER) were some of the biggest names in touring car racing in the 80s. They sat behind the wheel of the legendary BMW M3 E30 in the golden age of the DTM, picking up countless wins and titles with the car and securing the drivers their permanent spots in the BMW Motorsport history. It is, however, definitely the car that deserves pole position in the ancestral portrait gallery. Even now, just the sight of the design of the BMW M3 E30 and the unrivalled sound of its engine is enough to make the heart of every BMW Motorsport fan leap, be it at a BMW Group Classic event, or when the car is in action as a race taxi in the DTM support programme. Just wonderful memories at a time in which no real-life motorsport is possible? Not at all, since thanks to BMW Group România and Racing League România, the BMW M3 E30 DTM is making an impressive comeback in sim racing at the moment. The extremely popular virtual race series is currently in its fifth season in Romania. It is supported by BMW Group România as Title Partner. They stream all the events live on the BMW Romania Facebook page, and the events are also shown on TV and attract tens of thousands viewers more each weekend. “We don’t see ourselves as a sponsor in this project, but as a real partner with the goal of growing together and giving the championship a platform with high visibility and interaction,” said Andreea Ciglenean, Marketing Manager, BMW Group România. “When we entered into discussions with Racing League România, we had no idea that this season would be taking place at a time in which no real-life racing is possible. Now our project is a perfect example of how you can act safely and stay at home without having to miss out on racing altogether. That is an important aspect at the moment, and the BMW M3 E30 DTM is the perfect car for our race series.” A total of 30 cars line up on the starting grid in each race, but these days more than 150 sim racers take part in qualifying for these events, including Romanian tennis ace Florin Mergea, former ATP doubles top-ten player and now a passionate sim racer. The platform for the Racing League România is the popular racing simulation Assetto Corsa. “The Racing League România has been organising events for the sim racing community for over a decade now, but as real-life racing is no longer possible, virtual races are a hot topic in Romania,” said Alexandru Siclovan, promoter of Racing League România. “We are proud that we are able to provide a suitable media product that with its emotive commentary and interaction brings the best of both worlds together, a professional storyline like in real-life racing, and the breath of fresh air of a younger target audience into the mix.” Every bit as legendary as the BMW M3 E30 DTM are the racetracks on which the Racing League România holds its virtual events. The last two race weekends took place on the virtual versions of the Norisring (GER) and the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER). The season got underway on 15th March and comprises ten stops, each with two 30-minute races. Other tracks on the race calendar include the Virginia International Raceway (USA), Circuit Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), Circuit Park Zandvoort (NED), Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit (RSA) and the Brands Hatch GP Circuit (GBR) for the season finale being held on 17th May. There is still plenty of opportunity for real fans of the BMW M3 E30 DTM to reminisce and relive the emotions of the glorious history of the car during this difficult time. It is definitely worth watching the upcoming races of the Racing League România. Note to editors:We are aware of the current difficult situation, but decided to keep on providing you with regular press releases in the coming weeks and months.

Home office is the order of the day in the current global situation, and the BMW Junior Team newly established for 2020 is no exception. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) are all preparing themselves at home so that they are ready to catch up on their first races on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) that were originally scheduled to take place over the next few weeks as soon as possible. To do so, they are currently building on the foundation they laid during the mental and fitness training at Formula Medicine in January and February. They are also taking part in sim racing virtual races on a regular basis. New to the team is the company soft trim, who as Official Partner of BMW Motorsport is supplying the BMW Junior Team with professional racing seats. Everything was prepared: The BMW Junior Team was well on the way to moving from the fitness camp into their shared house at the Nürburgring and starting their season of racing at the beginning of March. But then much more important things came to the fore in the current exceptional situation. Now, Harper, Hesse and Verhagen are continuing their training programme individually in their home towns. The foundations that were laid for this at Formula Medicine are extremely valuable. “We spent a large part of the camp working on mental training. The fundamental goal was for the Juniors to deliver top performances on the racetrack while using as little mental energy as possible. So the primary focus of all our exercises was on improving mental efficiency,” explains Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli, founder of Formula Medicine. “I am very pleased with the progress made by all three Juniors. I think it’s fair to say that now they are all able to make much better assessments of themselves than at the start of the training.” And Ceccarelli also testifies to the three Juniors significantly improving their performance when it comes to fitness, heaping praise on them: “I’m particularly pleased that all three drivers completed the camp with a great deal of enthusiasm and also grew together as a real BMW Junior Team on a personal level.” Verhagen says: “The two months in Viareggio were incredible. I was really surprised how much I improved through the mental and fitness training. It is impressive what the Formula Medicine trainers achieve. I’d like to thank them all for their fantastic support. Living with Dan and Max was also great. Now I’m at home in the USA and am aware of how the current crisis is evolving here. It makes you incredibly conscious of just how important health is and that it is the top priority at the moment. We all have to persevere in this exceptional situation. The thought of racing on the Nordschleife in a real racing car with the BMW Junior Team at some point is what is keeping me going. I’m really looking forward to it.” BMW Junior Team with its own logo and livery.Although the trio can only meet virtually at the moment, they are still working as a team – particularly when it comes to sim racing. As of this week, the BMW Junior Team is, with their own logo and matching livery developed by Michael Scully of Designworks especially for BMW Motorsport, competing in both the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup and the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO. “I hardly had any experience of sim racing before I joined the BMW Junior Team. We are in the process of learning and are racing against some of the best sim racers out there. Naturally that is a huge challenge, but we’re getting better with every sim race that we take part in,” says Harper, who is currently staying with his family in Northern Ireland. “Unfortunately this is without my dad, who was in England on business and is currently stuck there due to the lockdown.” soft trim is Official Partner of BMW Motorsport.As a new Official Partner of BMW Motorsport, soft trim is supplying the Juniors with racing seats. As a development service provider, soft trim is an important partner for the automotive industry. The company founded in 2001 focuses on the area of seating technology. At the site in Dresden (GER) more than 60 employees work on developing seating concepts and in doing so establishing the basis for series production. The expertise built up in the industry is also well received in motorsport. Since 2019, soft trim has been supporting racing teams in designing customised seat pans for their drivers. The foundation is a measuring procedure that determines the optimum seating position in the car. Kai Rudolph, General Manager of soft trim, says: “The partnership is a logical step for soft trim, to make even better use of existing synergies. The BMW brand has played an important role for us as a seat developer for many years now. There is also the steadily growing importance of motorsport, where we supply teams and drivers with customised seat pans.” Hesse has already worked with soft trim and says: “I know the employees and the product really well, soft trim can do things with a seat pan that other companies can’t. They use a 3D scanning procedure that finds the perfect fit for your seat, which is hugely important for endurance races. On top of that, their method is really fast.” Regarding the current situation, Hesse says: “We’re trying to make the best of the current difficult situation by training as intensely as possible so that when everything has been weathered and we’re allowed back on the racetrack we will be even better prepared.” It is impossible to say when the BMW Junior Team will be able to continue their originally scheduled training programme at the moment. But when that time comes, everything is ready and waiting for the trio at the Nürburgring: The house and an area of the BMW M test centre in Nürburg (GER) converted specially for the mental and simulator training, which will provide the Juniors with the optimum conditions. As soon as they are allowed back on the racetrack, according to current planning, they will first get their permit for the Nordschleife in the BMW M240i Racing, before switching to the BMW M4 GT4 and later to the BMW M6 GT3. Note to editors:We are aware of the current difficult situation. Despite this, however, we have decided to provide you with regular media information in the coming weeks and months. We will report on our BMW works drivers on the sim racing scene and we will also provide you with interviews and background stories, particularly dealing with technology topics within BMW Group Motorsport.\n"}
{"prompt":"White beaches, brightly coloured houses, azure-blue water and evergreen palm trees. Travellers taking a trip down the Overseas Highway from Miami along the Florida Keys archipelago of islands discover that the reality puts even the most gorgeous postcards in the shade.  ->","completion":" Munich\/Miami. 42 bridges link up the Florida Keys with each other. The string of islands located in the south of the Sunshine State is a very special type of hotspot for tourists. The local residents see themselves as unconventional free spirits who are famous for living by their everyday principles of hospitality and self-determination, zest for life, tolerance and being close to nature. During the journey along the Overseas Highway from the mainland to Key West, the incredible flair of the islands is visible with every kilometre that passes. The journey ideally needs to be undertaken in a car that also has a unique character. The new MINI Cooper SE powered by its all-electric motor combines virtues that are typical of the brand such as cosmopolitan outlook, individual flair and driving fun with an enduring sense of sustainability.The locally zero-emission journey starts in South Beach, Miami’s most popular beach. The trip from this starting point covers 260 kilometres until you arrive in Key West, the most southerly point where the Overseas Highway comes to an end. The journey should be possible with a fully charged high voltage battery without taking a stopover on the way. The range of the new MINI Cooper SE determined in the official test cycle is between 235 and 270 kilometres.Different parts of the city like Wynwood Art District, South Beach and the Midtown Design District are famous for their brightly coloured murals – must-see paintings on the walls of the houses. Unknown spray painters alongside some famous artists have created a pathway to immortality with these murals, which are almost as popular for photographic subjects as the art-deco buildings in Miami Beach.Highway No. 1 snakes along past the zoo to the south of Miami, through the city of Homestead and out across the water. On Key Largo, the northernmost and biggest island, the harmony between tourism and nature conservation so characteristic of this region is evident for the first time. Large hotel buildings obscure the view of the water. At the same time, Key Largo houses the headquarters of the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF), an international research and education establishment focusing on marine ecology. The MINI Electric makes straight for a quick-charging station on the car park. Anybody who hasn’t started off with a fully charged battery can use the midday break to top up on energy supplies. The battery and charging unit of the new MINI Cooper SE are suitable for charging with direct current up to 50 kW. So even a completely empty battery can be fully charged in less than one and a half hours. For the stopover on Key Largo this means that while the travellers can stock up on calories by tucking into the island’s typical dessert of delicious key lime pie, the MINI Electric also has enough time to recharge its batteries.The range is only reduced in small increments during the kilometres to come. This is not simply due to the usual federal speed limits. There really isn’t much need to use the power of the electric motor packing 135 kW\/184 hp for any racy overtaking manoeuvres with the inevitable increase in electricity consumption. Drivers are well advised to adopt a leisurely pace when travelling through places like Islamorada, Tavernier or Duck Key so that they don’t miss the large number of picture-postcard motifs along the Overseas Highway. There’s no doubt that the air-conditioning is indispensable. But in the MINI Electric it operates extremely efficiently courtesy of innovative heat-pump technology.The next typical combinations of tourist attraction and environmental protection site come on Grassey Key and Marathon. The Dolphin Research Center is a specialist welfare and research location for marine mammals. The facilities for housing and carrying out research into the animals are financed partly by entry charges from visitors. They are able to look over the shoulders of researchers and register in advance to swim in the water with carefully selected dolphins under rigorous supervision. Just a few miles away, vets and biologists look after sick and injured marine turtles at the Turtle Hospital, which are then released back into the wild after they have fully recovered.Just outside the city boundary of Marathon, the route taken by the MINI Electric passes over Seven Mile Bridge. The longest bridge in the Keys connects Marathon with Bahia Honda, primarily popular with tourists looking for bathing and surfing opportunities. Entrances to the particularly beautiful beaches on Bahia Honda are rather difficult to find and most of them can only be accessed after payment of an entry charge. Anticipatory driving is also highly recommended when motoring along the roads on Big Pine Key. Notices and signs warn visitors to keep a lookout for key deer. And indeed one of the wild deer living there happens to be grazing on the grass along the side of the road. You always need to be ready to slam on the brakes, preferably with maximum recuperation performance. The new MINI Cooper SE will then rapidly decelerate if the driver just slightly releases the pressure on the accelerator pedal. A toggle switch under the central instrument activates this mode, allowing particularly large amounts of brake energy to flow back into the high-voltage battery.Under these conditions, the power reserve in the battery actually takes drivers into the historic centre of Key West, where a public charging station is quickly found. The MINI Electric crew spent the rest of the outing exploring on foot. From ‘the Southernmost Point of Continental USA’, the trip goes along Whitehead Street and Duval Street into the northerly harbour area of the city. This is where travellers can follow in the footsteps of Ernest Hemingway. The subsequent Nobel Prize Winner lived in Key West for some ten years from 1928 onwards and wrote works including his bestseller “To Have and Have Not” there. The writer’s home and his favourite bar “Sloppy Joe’s” are now tourist attractions. There are lots of atmospheric local restaurants in the immediate neighbourhood where freshly caught fish and seafood are served on spacious terraces.The self-assuredness of the islanders is demonstrated with humour and pride everywhere on Key West. For example, Independence Day is celebrated on 23 April. On this day, the inhabitants of the southernmost island of the Florida Keys celebrate the foundation of the Conch Republic in 1982. At that time, they declared a symbolic independence in protest against a border control post set up by the US Federal Government on the Overseas Highway. Officially, the uprising only lasted for one minute but it actually did put a stop to the checks, which were very detrimental for tourism. Today, the flag of the Conch Republic, named after the large shellfish commonly found around the Keys, is a popular souvenir.The individual lifestyle on Key West is also associated with a ritual that takes place every evening on Mallory Square. While the MINI Electric was quietly recharging its batteries at the charging station ready for the return journey back to Miami, local residents and guests were streaming onto the promenade in the north-west of the city. Holding a cool drink, all the people there looked out to sea waiting for the sunset. And as soon as the sun went down in the Gulf of Mexico, applause broke out. Standing ovations celebrated the beauty of nature and the happiness of being able to experience this wonderful phenomenon in a very special place.Editorial note:The MINI Electric road trip from Miami to Key West was produced before the outbreak of COVID-19. MINI and all involved parties are aware of their social responsibility and advise against such a trip at this time out of consideration for the health and well-being of all.\n"}

Art Basel and BMW today announced the 2020 artist shortlist of the BMW Art Journey, a joint initiative recognizing and supporting emerging artists worldwide. Like a mobile studio, the BMW Art Journey can take artists almost anywhere in the world to develop new ideas and envision new creative projects.As this year's Art Basel show in Hong Kong had to be cancelled due to the outbreak and spread of the new coronavirus, Covid-19, the jury conducted its selection process online. Artists and their galleries were invited to submit digital applications, including a short video by the artists explaining their work and process. For the first time, eligible participants included not only artists from the Discoveries sector of the 2020 show, but – more generally – artists presented by participating galleries founded less than ten years ago. The international jury chose the following shortlist:Leelee ChanBorn in 1984; lives and works in Hong Kong; represented by Capsule Shanghai.Jes FanBorn in 1990; lives and works in New York; represented by Empty Gallery, Hong Kong.Amy Lien & Enzo CamachoBorn in 1987 and 1985; live and work in New York and Manila; represented by 47 Canal, New York.The shortlisted artists are now invited to develop the proposal for their ideal journey, with the winner to be announced in June 2020.The members of this year’s expert jury are:Claire Hsu, Director Asia Art Archive, Hong KongMatthias Mühling, Director Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus, MunichPatrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, President Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, TurinPhilip Tinari, Director UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing Samson Young, artist and winner of the first BMW Art Journey“The shortlisted artists are united by a common interest in research-led practices that are well-positioned to benefit from the support that the BMW Art Journey can provide,” noted the jury in its unanimous decision. “While offering perspectives that are uniquely their own, these artists' visions are not bound by national and cultural boundaries.”“In the collaborative practice of Amy Lien and Enzo Camacho, archival and anthropological research comes to ground installations that make visible urgent, complex, unlikely narratives. Their planned presentation for Art Basel in Hong Kong, based on a religious mural by midcentury Filipino-American painter Alfonso Ossorio, struck us as one of the most multifaceted and compelling of the duo’s projects to date. Jes Fan excels in his use of materials, such as glass, silicon and resin. We appreciated his examination of the body at a molecular level, exploring its limits and framing the existence of a biological body in a digital contemporaneity. He has also probed the notion of otherness, questioning received categories of race, gender and identity. In the densely populated city Hong Kong, Leelee Chan opens up resonating spaces with her sculptures, as if from an unknown dimension. Her ethereal, extraterrestrial-looking objects are composed of the detritus of the big city. Like an archaeologist, she assembles fragmented snapshots of an urban civilization. At the same time, the objects appear to transcend the human understanding of space and time,” states the jury.Works of this year’s shortlisted artists can be viewed in a virtual showroom setting at https:\/\/www.artbasel.com\/bmw-art-journey.In collaboration with the winning artist, the journey will be documented and shared through publications, online and via social media.Past winners of the BMW Art Journey include sound and performance artist Samson Young (presented by a.m. Space, Hong Kong at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2015); video artists Henning Fehr and Philipp Rühr (presented by Galerie Max Mayer, Dusseldorf at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2015); Abigail Reynolds (presented by Rokeby, London at Art Basel's show in Hong Kong in 2016) as well as Max Hooper Schneider (presented by High Art, Paris at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2016), Astha Butail (represented by GALLERYSKE, New Dehli, Bangalore at Art Basel´s Hong Kong show in 2017), Jamal Cyrus (represented by Inman Gallery, Houston at Art Basel’s Miami Beach show in 2017), Zac Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland at Art Basel’s Hong Kong show in 2018) and Lu Yang (represented by the gallery Société, Berlin at Art Basel Hong Kong 2019).BMW has supported Art Basel’s shows in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong Kong for many years.For further information about the artists and the project, please visit:www.bmw-art-journey.com \n"}

The global corona situation is also having an impact on the BMW Motorrad Race Trophy. There will be no overall ranking for the 2020 season for BMW Motorrad Motorsport’s customer racing competition. This is due to the postponement and cancellation of numerous races in the individual race series that are classified for the Race Trophy. The Race Trophy has been a key pillar in BMW Motorrad’s motorsport activities since 2014. Every privateer BMW rider who competes in a race series classified for the Race Trophy is eligible to take part. A complex rating system sees them awarded points for the Race Trophy overall ranking based on their results in their respective championships. The rider who has picked up the most points by the end of the season wins the Race Trophy. In 2020, there would have been 25 race classes in 21 international and national championships that would have been classified. However, in most of these series, races have already been postponed or cancelled, and further changes to the schedule are to be expected. “The collaboration with our privateer BMW riders and teams in the international and national championships is extremely important to us. The Race Trophy brings the entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport family from around the world together, and this community is really important to us,” says BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “With the Race Trophy, we honour the successes that our privateer racers celebrate around the world. However, the corona crisis is currently having a huge impact on racing globally. In many series in which the BMW privateer riders are involved, races have already been postponed or cancelled. At this time it is impossible to predict when the racing season will be able to start in the countries affected, how many races will actually be able to be held and what the calendars will end up looking like. A fair distribution of points, and thereby equal opportunities, wouldn’t be possible for the overall ranking in this situation. Which is why we have decided that there will not be an overall ranking this season. We believe that the international BMW Race Trophy family will understand why we have taken this step, and still remain connected with our many privateer riders around the world as a community.” The technical support for the international racing customers provided by BMW Motorrad Motorsport engineers will still be made available this season, where this can be planned. \n"}

The virtual racing season continues to gather speed. Race two of the Digital Nürburgring Endurance Series powered by VCO was held on Saturday. BMW works driver Philipp Eng (AUT) finished on the podium in the three-hour race on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER). Together with his team-mates Alexander Voß and Laurin Heinrich (both GER), he finished second overall in the #189 BMW Z4 GT3. In doing so, he presented the BS+COMPETITION team with its first podium finish. Simulator racing is becoming increasingly popular in the current situation. As such, round two of the DNLS powered by VCO, which was broadcast live on the internet, featured a very strong field. Many professional racing drivers from a wide range of racing series took their place on the grid. As well as Eng, they included BMW works drivers Bruno Spengler (CAN), Martin Tomczyk (GER), Jens Klingmann (GER) and Jesse Krohn (FIN), as well as the BMW Junior Team with Neil Verhagen (USA), Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER). In total, BMW teams – including BMW M Customer Racing team, Walkenhorst Motorsport – fielded eight BMW Z4 GT3s. In sim racing, the drivers each sit at home on their own race simulators. During the virtual driver changeover, the driver hands over the car to his team-mate, who could be sat in a different city, country, or even continent. Apart from the g-force, the physical demands are almost as great as in a real racing car. In the case of a crash, the car must return to the garage for repairs and wait an amount of time appropriate to the damage before it can return to the track. Race control can also impose time penalties. One of the features of sim racing is that professional racing drivers from real motorsport can compete alongside professional sim racers. The fans can also get involved. They can follow the action live on the internet and various social media channels, such as the BMW Motorsport Facebook channel. The drivers also involve their fans on their social channels. For example, Eng showed himself celebrating at home and spraying champagne on his terrace on Instagram. Thousands of fans around the world were involved on various channels during round two of the DNLS powered by VCO. In addition, all class winners where available for a Q&A in a digital press conference after the race. The race. In qualifying, Eng landed the #189 BMW Z4 GT3 on third place on the virtual grid. As the start driver, he soon gained a place and the BS+COMPETITION team was running second when he handed over to Voß. The team held onto that position comfortably until Heinrich guided the BMW Z4 GT3 over the finish line after a little more than three hours of racing. Victory went to the Williams Esports team. The second BMW Z4 GT3 in the overall standings was the #35 Walkenhorst Motorsport car. Mikkel Jensen (DEN), Jody Fannin (GBR) and Christian Krognes (NOR) came home ninth to claim a top-ten finish. BMW works driver Krohn bolstered the VRS Coanda Simsport team. He and his team-mates Martti Pietilä (FIN) and Tommy Ostgaard (NOR) finished 14th overall in the #108 BMW Z4 GT3. BMW works driver Spengler raced in a characteristically black BMW Z4 GT3 for Team BMW Bank (car number 107). His team-mates were well-known sim racing YouTuber Jimmy Broadbent (GBR) and Nils Koch (GER). The trio started strongly, but was then forced to stop for repairs, during which time they lost ground, and eventually finished 25th. BMW Team Green Hell with Tomczyk, Klingmann and Kay Kaschube (GER) launched an impressive fightback from 16th on the grid, but dropped back through the field after a crash and ultimately had to settle for 27th place. The BMW Junior Team was an innocent party in a crash 20 minutes into the race, which resulted in a long stop for repairs. In the end, Verhagen, Harper and Hesse came home 50th in the #113 BMW Z4 GT3. Quotes after race two of the DNLS powered by VCO. Philipp Eng (#189 BMW Z4 GT3, BS+COMPETITION, 2nd place overall, 2nd place SP9): “I am delighted to have finished runner-up and claimed the first podium for the BS+COMPETITION team. It was really good fun and my pulse was racing faster than in a real racing car because I did not have quite the same control as in a real car, partly because I am still lacking a bit of practice. However, the car was great, the set-up was perfect, and the strategy was also spot on. We worked perfectly as a team, which was key to us claiming a spot on the podium.” Jesse Krohn (#108 BMW Z4 GT3, VRS Coanda Simsport, 14th place overall, 11th place SP9): “It was an eventful race for us. After spinning at the start, we fought back well. It was very nice to line up alongside a Finnish and a Norwegian sim pro. I still have a lot to learn from these guys, as there are some big differences compared to the real Nürburgring Endurance Series. That was my first race and I think that we will definitely improve as we take part in more races. This time, everything was a little bit at short notice. I think we will benefit from having a little more preparation time as a team. Nonetheless, it was great fun and that is a good result, given the issues we had at the start.” Bruno Spengler (#107 BMW Z4 GT3, Team BMW Bank, 25th place overall, 18th place SP9): “Unfortunately, I struggled with technical issues on my PC in qualifying. That meant I was only able to do one lap, which is obviously not enough on the Nordschleife. In the race, I fought my way into sixth place from 16th on the grid. We had a good car and really good pace. Jimmy Broadbent also performed really strongly as the second driver. Unfortunately, Nils Koch also had a technical fault, which resulted in him being involved in a crash. That is obviously very unlucky, but I think we can definitely learn from this race. This was my first race in the DNLS and I obviously hope that more will follow.” Martin Tomczyk (#112 BMW Z4 GT3, BMW Team Green Hell, 27th place overall, 20th place SP9): “It was another great event. After the first race, in which everyone was finding their feet a bit, everyone now knows what it is all about. And you could see that from the way the field was even more evenly matched. The start of the race was excellent. I was able to hold my own and make up some positions. Unfortunately, Jens then made light contact with the crash barrier and, after eleven minutes of repairs, we lost a lot of ground. However, it was great fun – and noticeable that you felt as excited as at a real racetrack, and frustrated if you suffered a crash like we did. Although it is only virtual, you still feel incredibly competitive as a racing driver, and go through all the emotions accordingly. I think it is great, and am already looking forward to the next race.” Jens Klingmann (#112 BMW Z4 GT3, BMW Team Green Hell, 27th place overall, 20th place SP9): “That was our second race in the DNLS, this time as a trio with Martin and Kay. Kay was very helpful to us in the run-up to the event, and assisted us with the set-up. Compared to race one, we took a big step forward, including with regard to our personal performance. As an absolute sim rookie, I am happy with the way I was able to improve my performance and my lap times, even though I was not quite up there with the very top drivers. Martin made a superb start and we were running in the top ten. Unfortunately, I then lost the rear axle a little and was unable to rescue the situation. As such, we had to pull into the pits for repairs, which cost us a lot of time. That is my fault, and I’ll try to do better next time. However, it is great fun, we are competitive, and I am looking forward to the next race. I will continue to practice on the simulator between now and then.” Max Hesse (#113 BMW Z4 GT3, BMW Junior Team, 50th place overall, 21st place SP9): “The crash in today’s race was unlucky. Neil was almost past the Mercedes, and it looked as though he had pulled off a successful manoeuvre. However, Dominik Baumann then got the blind corner all wrong and there was a crash. Generally speaking, we have taken a massive step in the right direction this week as the BMW Junior Team. We have relatively little experience of sim racing compared to many others, but we are learning a huge amount. We dramatically improved our lap times on the Nordschleife and are getting closer in terms of the set-up. We will stick to it, practice a lot, and continue to improve over the coming weeks.” Results BMW Z4 GT3 – round two of the DNLS powered by VCO. 2nd place overall \/ 2nd SP9: #189 BS+COMPETITION (Philipp Eng, Alexander Voß, Laurin Heinrich) 9th place overall \/ 9th SP9: #35 Walkenhorst Motorsport (Mikkel Jensen, Jody Fannin, Christian Krognes) 14th place overall \/ 11th SP9: #108 VRS Coanda Simsport (Jesse Krohn, Martti Pietilä, Tommy Ostgaard) 19th place overall \/ 14th SP9: #118 VRS Coanda Simsport (Marc Basseng, Jörn Schmidt-Staade, Paschalis Gkergis) 24th place overall \/ 17th SP9: #34 Walkenhorst Motorsport (David Pittard, Sam Michaels, Scott Michaels) 25th place overall \/ 18th SP9: #107 Team BMW Bank (Bruno Spengler, Jimmy Broadbent, Nils Koch) 27th place overall, 20th SP9: #112 BMW Team Green Hell (Martin Tomczyk, Jens Klingmann, Kay Kaschube) 50th place overall \/ 21st SP9: #113 BMW Junior Team (Neil Verhagen, Dan Harper, Max Hesse) \n"}

World-wide, societies are facing a difficult and challenging situation, not only because in many areas life has come to a halt at the moment and people are urged to stay at home to prevent the spread of the corona virus, but also as the current situation causes sorrow and grief for many people. Someone who has experience with difficult situations is BMW works driver and brand ambassador Alessandro Zanardi (ITA). With his positive attitude, he inspires people all around the world, also in crises like the current one. In an interview, Zanardi speaks about staying at his home in Northern Italy, about his daily routines and about the positives that can help him in difficult times. Alessandro, geographically you are in the centre of the virus crisis in Italy. First and foremost: how are you and your family? Alessandro Zanardi: “We are all well. We of course feel the consequences of what is happening but for sure our thoughts and prayers go to all the people and all the families fighting the virus much more directly, in all the hospitals with all the supporting people, the nurses, the doctors and so on. We feel that we are very lucky. We have a house, I have all my training equipment here, we are healthy – therefore we are not suffering more than it is reasonable to feel like you are suffering.” Can you describe your daily life at the moment? Zanardi: “Personally, as someone who still has sporting objectives in front of me, I can focus much more on my training. For sure I would have never ever wished for something like this to happen but in everything there are always different aspects and not everything is always negative as not everything is always positive. But for me one positive aspect is that the phone is not ringing much, that nobody is asking me to go anywhere so I have much more time to assess to my priorities in the order I want. I wake up in the morning and I say: okay, this is the time of the day when I will be training. So I plan my day around my sporting programmes and of course I am working a lot with the computer, I am staying connected on a professional level by sending emails, preparing stuff. And until recently, all preparations were also with regard to the most important objective of the year which would have been Tokyo. Of course now I have to reconsider everything but the way I am it won’t be difficult to find a new objective to chase. I can focus on different projects and I have many.” But one of your goals and projects is now Tokyo 2021? Zanardi: “Well, of course at my age from a sporting point of view every year is like a dog’s year, it’s like seven years. If it was almost kind of a miracle for me to aim to go to Tokyo approaching my 54th birthday, it will be even harder to do it one year later when I will be approaching my 55th birthday. But for sure I can tell you that regarding my intentions, I am perfect. Regarding turning my intentions into achievements, time will tell, we will see.” So let’s get back to the current situation: is it a challenge to deal with isolation? Zanardi: “I have to say that I have total trust in the scientists who are studying the problem and we have to believe in them; we have to help in the best way we can which now is staying at home, trying to avoid spreading the virus. Because now we are learning that the number of people infected is probably ten times higher than the one we were thinking just a few days ago. This is because we did not test the total population. And there are a lot of people probably being infected without knowing it because they don’t have any symptoms. This of course creates a lot of concerns and the only way you can avoid bad consequences is to make sure that everybody stays home that the virus is not spread even more. On the other hand, in the majority of the cases, we do have the resources inside our body to fight the virus and to win this battle like we do with other viral infections. So we have to wait, we have to trust the people who are right now fighting the illness from the front row of the battle and just obey to the rules that every government is sending out to the population – it’s as simple as that.” You’ve been a fighter all your life and especially after your accident. Nowadays you are an inspiration for many people. From your experience, is there anything you want to tell your fellow Italians and the rest of the world in these difficult times? Zanardi: “First of all I have to say that the fact that I had to fight some difficult situations over the course of my life does not mean that I am enjoying this type of fight (laughs). I would rather avoid problems. But for sure, whenever you overcome a problem in your life it’s an experience for which you have to develop new tools. And once the experience is behind you, these tools can possibly stay in your repertoire to overcome other problems which you inevitably have to face during the journey of your life. And I can tell that people are already different, I can tell that people are re-discovering the sense of community, the sense of friendships, the sense of needing each other in order to really complete themselves. Because we are nothing if we cannot express our emotions. So it’s not so much up to people like me to send out a particular message but the real hope is that people will be more talented from now on in looking for that type of inspiration, listening, leaning on others and allowing others to help them. Because that’s what we are, and we are nothing without this all. So this is the only positive aspect of what is happening and we have to make sure that this experience will teach everyone a good lesson and we will leave this all behind us with better instruments to proceed in our life and to live a better one.” Does your positive attitude towards life help in such difficult times? Zanardi: “It’s difficult for me to say because as I said at the beginning I know that I am someone who has the privilege of having a house, I have my wooden house in the garden where I keep all my training equipment, I have a great, healthy family surrounding me, we are watching a lot of movies, I have plenty of things to do. So the discomfort I am experiencing these days is very, very small in comparison to what other people are experiencing. But at the same time, what I can tell you is that the common point with what is happening these days from a personal point of view and what happened to me another period in my life is the capability in having an interest in the positive aspects that you can always find in everything. And that is what led me to turn what had happened to me into a great opportunity. When I lost my legs, even before I could discover where to search and what to find, I was very confident that I would find something positive in what happened. And I did. And with what I did in my life I guess I proved that that concept is always true. So right now from my small miseries I can tell you that the positive aspect is the fact that the phone is not ringing much, I don’t have to travel – these are very slowed-down days. And in the busy life like the one I normally live I am kind of enjoying the quiet phase I am going through. But I am sure there are much better aspects which, if we are curious enough, which we can collect, which we can keep or use as a starting point to build a better life for everyone of us. The important thing right now is not to panic, is not to take our own decisions without the right information. The important thing is to act like a community, it is to really follow the instructions we are receiving and if the biggest down point is that we have to stay at home for another month, another two months, you’ll name it – we have to learn to cope with it. The sun will rise sooner or later and there will be time to do other things. But for now it’s important that we put this enemy behind us in the right way.” Facts about Alessandro Zanardi. Date of birth: 23rd October 1966Place of birth: Bologna (IT)Marital status: Married to Daniela, one son: Niccólo Career in racing. 201924 Hours of Daytona in the BMW M8 GTE, SUPER GT x DTM Dream Race at Fuji in the BMW M4 DTM2018DTM guest appearance in the BMW M4 DTM: fifth place in Sunday’s race at Misano2016Debut in the BMW M6 GT3: Victory at the final round of the Italian GT Championship at Mugello201524h Spa-Francorchamps with Timo Glock and Bruno Spengler with the BMW Z4 GT32014Blancpain Sprint Series with the BMW Z4 GT32005 - 2009FIA World Touring Car Championship WTCC with BMW (four wins)2004FIA European Touring Car Championship ETCC with BMW2003Comeback as a racing driver with BMW in the FIA European Touring Car Championship ETCC2001CART Championship, severe accident on 15th September at Lausitzring, loses both legs1999Formula One1997 - 1998CART World Series 1996IndyCar World Series1991 - 1994Formula One Main successes as para-athlete. 2019Para-cycling World Championship: 2 gold medals, 1 silver medal2018Para-cycling World Championship: 1 silver medal, 1 bronze medal, long distance triathlon at Cervia with a new world record of 8:26:06 hours2017Para-cycling World Championship: 2 gold medals, 1 silver medal2016Paralympic Games Rio de Janeiro: 2 gold medals, 1 silver medal2015Para-cycling World Championship: 3 gold medals, long distance triathlon in Hawaii in 09:40:37 hours2014Para-cycling World Championship: 2 gold medals, long distance triathlon in Hawaii in 9:47:14 hours2013Para-cycling World Championship: 3 gold medals2012Paralympic Games London: 2 gold medals, 1 silver medal \n"}

There is no telling yet when it will be possible to hold races again. During the wait, the two BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team riders, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Eugene Laverty (IRL), are following the guidance to ‘Stay at Home’. Despite that, they are both keeping busy – although in different ways. While Sykes, as a father, has now more time to spend with his daughters, Laverty is pursuing long-held interests, such as music and languages. Stay at Home – they both did, even before it was made obligatory by governments. “It’s a strange time and while the situation is relatively under control in my estimate here in Portugal, my wife Pippa and I have opted to keep ourselves in lockdown out of the principle ‘Stay at Home’,” says Laverty, who lives near the Portimão race track in Portugal. Sykes adds: “It’s a difficult time for everybody world-wide in this present time. Everybody is doing their part, trying to get this virus under control. It is best to stay at home at the moment and hope that this passes sooner rather than later.” Usually, WorldSBK riders are on the road a lot. So for family man Sykes, the break brings with it the positive that he can now spend much more time with his two daughters. They are with him at his home in Leamington Spa, England. The three of them are staying in touch with the rest of their close family by phone. According to Sykes, in general not a lot has changed for him at the moment. “I’m very fortunate, as since I was young one of my goals was working towards getting myself set up in a nice home. I certainly thank my lucky stars at this time more than ever.” His home has large grounds, allowing the trio to spend plenty of time outside, whilst still staying at home. “We’ve got a few things set up outside along with a very large trampoline in the garden, which we are using a lot,” says Sykes. “We have been lucky to have great weather here. It has almost been like early summer so we have been playing a lot outside. My two girls love to dance, so I turned on the outside music and set up a little wooden stage for the girls to dance on. It was great value entertainment for me too.” And when it cools down outside, the play continues inside. “We paint, do crafts, watch movies and indulge in a number of treats. We are able to still be quite normal, with the exception of not going to school at present.” With this in mind, Sykes has taken on a new role of being a teacher for his children and helps with the homework from school for this extended period. As well as the garden and the living room, Sykes also spends a lot of time in the kitchen. “I have always been the one to do the cooking anyway, but the chef side in me has come out in force now,” he grins. “I always think of good meal plans in my head for me and my girls because we always eat fresh food but obviously now that luxury is not as simple so my freezer is full as we have come up with a different approach to make the ingredients go further.” Sykes is also in action as a craftsman, carrying out some DIY work around his house. Guitar, language and first aid courses. Meanwhile, Laverty is also far from bored in Portugal. One of the first things he did at home was to take on some 1000-piece jigsaws. The first one is already complete, with more to follow. He has also signed up for an online guitar course. “So come the summer we may have to schedule some gigs around World Superbike race weekends. Entry will be free and complimentary ear plugs provided,” he says with a chuckle. Laverty has been learning Portuguese for a long time, but has now upped his daily lessons. “Music and language are two things that I wish I’d done more of as a kid, and now I’m making up for it. They’re great for the mind, too,“ he says. Together with his wife Pippa, Laverty is taking part in an online first aid course. They are learning what to do, for example, in case of a respiratory arrest, heart attack or haemorrhages, such as cardiopulmonary massage and the recovery position. “They are important basic lessons that can save lives,” Laverty stresses. Laverty is also very active on his social media channels and is coming up with things for his fans. These include his podcast, which he now records from home. And – thanks to the wonders of digital networking via social media – he also takes on various different challenges with other racers from the world of two and four-wheel motorsport, from jigsaws to fitness challenges. Speaking of fitness, fitness training obviously still takes up plenty of time for the two riders from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. As professional racers, they are preparing for the moment when everything resumes. For Sykes, the current situation has changed nothing in this regard. “I’ve been training from home since 2011,” he explains. “I always planned to be based at home for a number of reasons but mainly to be more productive with my time so I am lucky to have a fully-functioning gym at home. That means I am very well set-up and don’t have to worry about the training aspect. The only thing I am not doing at this moment is to go cycling outside.” Laverty has also had to put his big hobby, cycling, on hold. “We are still permitted to, but the reality is that there are 100,000s of cycling accidents per year and now is not the time to add stress to our healthcare workers.” And so his bike sits on a stationary trainer in his fitness room at home. While he spends hours clocking up the kilometres at home, he watches old racing documentaries and season reviews. In addition, Laverty uses a power station framework for his strength and conditioning. “I am missing riding motorbikes,” Laverty says. “But absence makes the heart grow fonder, so I will be more than ready to return to action!” Note to editors:We are aware of the difficult situation at present. Despite this, however, we have decided to provide you with regular media information for the near future, in the form of background stories regarding BMW Motorrad Motorsport. \n"}

In times of uncertainty, inspiring people play an even more important role in sustaining society. The BMW Group and CNN International Commercial (CNNIC) have teamed up to portray the stories and attitude of some of the most remarkable creatives, artists and leaders of our time through two unique series comprising a total of eleven short films exploring “The Art of Leadership”. By focusing on the personal stories that drove exceptional individuals in their field to inspire modern society, each film in the series will embody core leadership values of BMW: responsibility, inner strength and independence. Values also inherent to BMW´s luxury car suite – BMW’s X7, 7, 8 und M8 Series. On Thursday, CNN kicked off a six-part branded content series by launching the first brand film produced by CNNIC’s award-winning in-house studio Create. This first film portrays one of the most successful DJ duos and electronic music producers in the world, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike. Set against the backdrop of one of their concerts in Norway, the Belgian brothers recall how they became leaders in their field, reflecting on their passion and the relationship with their audience. This and the other upcoming brand films produced by Create are shot and edited for global distribution on a mix of CNN International’s platforms across TV, digital, and social, Great Big Story and will also be featured on BMW’s central brand website. Later this year Great Big Story, CNN’s global media company devoted to cinematic storytelling, will launch a sponsored editorial series comprising five micro-documentaries that put the spotlight on inspiring women and men who created their social impact on leading by example. The first film scheduled for May, will introduce the fascinating double life of Brandon Tory. Talented in tech while being a gifted emcee, Brandon successfully navigates both worlds – working as a senior AI engineer at Google by day and a successful hip-hop artist at night. Each film will run across Great Big Story’s platforms and social accounts, while distribution will be enhanced using WarnerMedia’s Launchpad technology to reach defined audiences across social media. “BMW has a long and diverse history of projects that provide platforms and stages for creative minds and bold new voices - be it in design, art, sports or engineering. We see it as one of our missions - and have always done so, to enable and nurture transformation. These stories are the result of a perfect match between two entities which share the same values and goals. We are absolutely delighted that CNN and BMW work together to create these unique pieces about exceptional people, who are rethinking and redefining leadership. As we are always striving for excellence, we strongly believe this partnership is a milestone for both of us.” said Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President Customer and Brand BMW.“All the best partnerships are based on common values, and I am delighted that this is the case with this exciting new project with BMW,” said Cathy Ibal, Senior Vice President, EMEA, CNN International Commercial. “As leaders in our respective fields, we honor and value those talents and characters that are portrayed in the films as they change our society for the better. Powerful, emotional storytelling from Create and Great Big Story will have a prominent stage as we distribute these films in smart ways across all platforms to reach a truly global audience that values leadership and the stories behind it.” Facebook:https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/greatbigstory\/videos\/531948957462067\/Twitter:https:\/\/twitter.com\/greatbigstory\/status\/1243326871686635520Instagram:https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B-N1dabhs01\/\n"}

The race will start at 14:30 (EST) and broadcast on the iRacing eSports Network on YouTube and Twitch. Statements on the “Super Sim Saturday”. Maximilian Günther: “I am really looking forward to the next all-star race on Saturday. Last weekend was my first taste of eSports racing, and I can say without any doubt that I am hungry for more.” Philipp Eng: “I am very much looking forward to taking to the virtual racetrack with so many of my fellow professional racing drivers and sim racers. At the moment, the simulator is our only opportunity to go racing. I will prepare as well as possible and hope to be up there at the front of the field.” Colton Herta (BMW Team Black, #23 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “I'm looking forward to racing this weekend. It's always exciting to go up against everyone no matter the circumstances. Like many things right now racing is coming to a stop at the minute so I think this will help propel interest and hopefully give people an outlet to watch some form of Motorsport.” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team Black, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “I am very excited to race against my IMSA competitiors and be a part of something new. I’m not sure something like this has been put together by a major championship.” Bruno Spengler (BMW Team Red, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “Sim racing is an important tool that allows a driver to stay fit. And now, while we are all staying safe we can keep on doing our job. I am pleased to be a part of this event and look to put on a good show along with my BMW colleagues.” Nick Catsburg (BMW Team Red, #26 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “This weekend’s SuperSebring race is going to be awesome. Everyone i currently spending more time on the simulator and I would like to thank IMSA for this initiative.” Jens Klingmann (#112 BMW Z4 GT3): “I am actually new to sim racing and am naturally a little nervous about my very first race in the simulator. It is fascinating to see how sim racing has developed, particularly in recent years. It is a fantastic alternative to real motor racing for us, particularly at the moment. I can hardly wait to make my debut alongside my team-mate Martin Tomczyk – and on the Nordschleife, of all places.” Martin Tomczyk (#112 BMW Z4 GT3): “It is obviously a shame for us racing drivers to be at home instead of at the racetrack at the moment. As such, I am all the more delighted that sim racing is offering us the opportunity to still go racing. Personally, I am spending a lot of time in the simulator at the moment. I think holding the season-opener on the Nordschleife in a virtual environment, and in line with the original regulations, is a great idea. I am sure there will be a lot of well-known names on the grid.” Neil Verhagen (#113 BMW Z4 GT3): “It is obviously a shame that we are unable to make our debut on the Nordschleife with the BMW Junior Team this weekend. However, instead of that I now have the opportunity to take part in this race alongside Dan. I am sure I can learn a lot about both sim racing and the Nordschleife.” Dan Harper (#113 BMW Z4 GT3): “We should actually have been making our debut on the Nordschleife this weekend. Unfortunately, that is no longer possible. However, I am looking forward to the virtual race. We are racers and want to be quick in the simulator too. As such, we will get in as much practice as possible before the race on Saturday.”\n"}

The unique function offers new options for making the most out of the capabilities of BMW plug-in hybrid models for locally emission-free driving in city traffic. BMW eDrive Zones trigger an automatic change to the purely electric operating mode as soon as the vehicle enters a designated area, e.g. low emission zones. BMW eDrive Zones are now available in various BMW plug-in hybrid models. In addition, the BMW Points loyalty programme will be introduced later in the year, with which drivers of BMW plug-in hybrid models will be rewarded with attractive premiums via a point system. Every electrically driven kilometre counts, and within an eDrive Zone, twice as many points can be collected. By collecting a sufficient number of points, participants can gain access to attractive rewards such as free charging volumes on BMW Charging.The BMW Group is setting important impulses for more sustainability on the roads, both with the continuous expansion of the range of vehicles with electrified drive systems and with the consistent advancement of BMW eDrive technology. BMW Plug-in hybrid models of the BMW and MINI premium brands are now available in all relevant vehicle segments.The BMW eDrive Zones now help to make use of the potential of plug-in hybrid vehicles in reducing emissions in urban traffic even more intensively than before. This innovative service brings together the BMW Group's expertise in the fields of electromobility and digitalisation. Both fields of development are components of the future topics D+ACES (Design, Automated Driving, Connectivity, Electrification and Services) which are anchored in the corporate strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT.__________________________With the introduction of the innovative BMW eDrive Zone and BMW Points digital services, the BMW Group is showing its determination to use technological innovations consistently and even independently of legal regulations in the interests of greater sustainability in the field of individual mobility. This corporate strategy generates impulses for the entire automotive industry and for cities all over the world. The technology approach developed by the BMW Group for the eDrive Zone service would also be conceivable for plug-in hybrid models from other brands. Besides that, there is the option of defining an eDrive Zone for each metropolitan area. This could give cities a comparatively simple way of promoting electromobility even further and thus contributing to improving urban quality of life. The new functions create additional incentives to reduce fuel consumption and emissions when driving in urban traffic and help to rise quality of life in the urban environment. For the driver, the increasing share of electric driving also contributes to a reduction in operating costs. A purely electric trip results in significantly lower energy costs than using the combustion engine as is shown by comparative calculations for current plug-in hybrid models. This applies particularly to city traffic, where electric power consistently achieves a higher level of efficiency than a petrol or diesel engine.Intelligent networking increases the share of electric driving.The development of the BMW eDrive Zones service is based on a BMW Group pilot project in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam. There, 50 drivers of plug-in hybrid models were given access to the GPS coordinates of defined inner city areas via a dedicated app. When entering this area the drivers were asked to change to the purely electric driving mode MAX eDrive. After only a few months, it was already apparent that the drivers involved in the pilot project had covered around 90 percent of all routes within the Rotterdam eDrive Zone in purely electric mode. The BMW eDrive Zones service, now standard in various BMW plug-in hybrid models, uses geo-fencing technology via GPS. Switching to the purely electric driving mode is automatic. When the service is activated, each available eDrive Zone on the navigation map is graphically highlighted in the Control Display. There you will also see a notice that the vehicle automatically switches to ELECTRIC mode as soon as it reaches an eDrive zone. The plug-in hybrid vehicle is locally emission-free for as long as the charge level of the high-voltage battery allows within the eDrive zone. If the energy reserves run out, the activation of the combustion engine is also shown in the Control Display.The BMW eDrive Zones service is now available in all variants of the BMW plug-in-hybrid models BMW 745e, BMW X5 xDrive45e and BMW 330e. Further models will follow successively. BMW eDrive Zones available in about 80 European cities.The benefits of the digital BMW eDrive Zone service can be experienced in a large number of major European cities and their low emission zones from the very beginning. All current 58 cities and regions in Germany that have already defined a low emission zone were taken into account. Besides that, there are 20 other core areas of major cities in Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. The list will be expanded in the future to include additional countries and cities, so that the electric driving shares of plug-in hybrid models can be increased in a steadily growing number of city areas.In Germany, the following cities and regions have currently designated a low emission zone - and have been defined as BMW eDrive Zones: Aachen, Augsburg, Balingen, Berlin, Bonn, Bremen, Darmstadt, Dinslaken, Düsseldorf, Erfurt, Eschweiler, Frankfurt\/Main, Freiburg, Hagen, Halle (Saale), Hanover, Heidelberg, Heidenheim, Heilbronn, Herrenberg, Ilsfeld, Karlsruhe, Krefeld, Cologne, Langenfeld, Leipzig, Leonberg\/Hemmingen and surroundings, Limburg an der Lahn, Ludwigsburg and surroundings, Magdeburg, Mainz, Mannheim, Marburg, Mönchengladbach, Mühlacker, Munich, Münster, Neuss, Nürnberg, Offenbach, Osnabrück, Overath, Pfinztal, Pforzheim, Regensburg, Remscheid, Reutlingen, Ruhr area, Schramberg, Schwäbisch-Gmünd, Siegen, Stuttgart, Tübingen, Ulm, Urbach, Wendlingen, Wiesbaden, Wuppertal.BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles have long offered considerable benefits as compared to those with traditional drives:Positive overall CO2 balance for BMW plug-in hybrids.Sometimes the \"real\" life cycle assessment of plug-in hybrid vehicles is questioned, especially in markets with a low share of green electricity in the public grid. For BMW plug-in-hybrid models, the BMW Group has had CO2 certificates drawn up for the entire cycle from raw material procurement, supply chain, production and use phase to recycling.When charging with European average electricity during the use phase, the BMW plug-in-hybrid models show substantial CO2 savings compared to their conventionally driven counterparts. The BMW Group does not launch an electrified vehicle without proof of this kind.\n"}

The BMW Group has successfully concluded the financial year 2019, continuing the upward trend in profitability in the fourth quarter. At the same time, between October and December 2019, revenues reached their highest level ever for a single quarter, reflecting the growing proportion of vehicles from the upper luxury segment. Over the full year, Group revenues exceeded 100 billion euros for the first time and were more than twice as high as in 2009. \"In 2019, we improved our profitability from quarter to quarter – despite a challenging market environment. This shows that we have the right products on the road and that our strategy is effective,\" stated the Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Oliver Zipse, on Thursday in Munich. \"We are embracing the transformation of our industry with confidence and trust in our innovative strength. We recognised the signs of change at an early stage and made preparations accordingly. Our full potential is now emerging – at exactly the right moment.\" Unequivocal commitment to achieving CO2-targets The BMW Group is continuously working to reduce the CO2-emissions of its new car fleet. The company has always lived up to its voluntary commitment and will achieve the CO2 fleet target for its European new car registrations also this year. This is around 20 percent below last year´s target. One third of that step can be achieved by further improvements to conventional drivetrain systems and two-thirds by the growth in the field of electrified vehicles. The BMW Group’s endeavours to meet future mandatory CO2 and fuel consumption limits are therefore based on the combined impact of Efficient Dynamics technologies – which have been deployed by the BMW Group since 2007 – and the ongoing electrification of vehicles. BMW Group to offer five all-electric series models by end of 2021 As a pioneer of electric mobility, the BMW Group is already today a leading manufacturer and supplier of electrified vehicles and is currently in the process of expanding its range significantly. By the end of 2021, the company intends to have more than one million vehicles with all-electric or plug-in hybrid drivetrains on the roads. At that stage, the BMW Group will offer five all-electric series production vehicles. Alongside the BMW i3, demand for which increased for the sixth year in succession, production of the all-electric MINI Cooper SE* was commenced at the Oxford plant (UK) towards the end of 2019. The BMW iX3 will go into production this year at the plant in Shenyang, China, followed in 2021 by the BMW iNEXT in Dingolfing, Germany, and the BMW i4 at the Munich plant – all of which will be equipped with fifth-generation electric drivetrain technology. By 2023, the BMW Group will already have 25 electrified models on the roads – more than half of them all-electric. The key to achieving this objective is having intelligent vehicle architectures that, with the aid of a highly flexible production system, enable a model to be powered fully electrically, as a plug-in hybrid or with a combustion engine. With these prerequisites in place, the company is in an ideal position to meet demand in each relevant market segment and offer its customers a genuine power of choice between the various drive types. By 2021, demand for electrified vehicles is predicted to double compared to 2019. The BMW Group then expects to see a steep growth curve up to 2025, with sales of electrified vehicles growing on average by more than 30 per cent p.a. High upfront expenditure for future mobility In paving the way for the future of mobility, a substantial level of upfront expenditure was again required during the period under report. Research and development expenses for the year 2019 in accordance with IFRS totalled € 5,952 million, significantly up on the previous year dealers and other third parties when they purchase a company vehicle at auction and dealers when they purchase company vehicles directly from BMW Group. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent third party dealers. The vast majority of deliveries – and hence the reporting to BMW Group of deliveries – is made by independent third party dealers. Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenue that BMW Group recognises in respect of such reporting period. EBITAbbreviation for “Earnings Before Interest and Taxes”, equivalent in the BMW Group income statement to “Profit \/ loss before financial result”.

The 26-year-old will contest the Asia Road Racing Championship (ARRC) for the ONEXOX BMW TKKR SAG Team this season, with backing from BMW Motorrad Motorsport and partner alpha Racing. The season opener was held at the Sepang International Circuit near Kuala Lumpur (MAS), and Reiterberger caused a stir on his BMW S 1000 RR right from the start. Before the actual race weekend, a test was scheduled for the start of the week in Sepang in which Reiterberger set another lap record. He went on to set further records in the practice and qualifying sessions, which saw him claim pole position on his RR. However, it started raining just in time for the first race, and Reiterberger was in fourth place when he saw the chequered flag. In the dry second race, he lived up to his standing as favourite and celebrated his first win of the season with a lead of almost eight seconds. “We’re delighted with the win,” said Reiterberger. “Undoubtedly there are a few areas in which we could improve. But apart from a few minor details, I’m really happy. I’d like to thank my whole crew at the ONEXOX BMW TKKR SAG Team and alpha Racing. I’ve got most of my former crew with me again with these guys.

The BMW Concept i4 takes electric drive to the core of the BMW brand and heralds a new era in Sheer Driving Pleasure. The BMW Concept i4 represents a look ahead to the BMW i4, slated to enter production in 2021. It provides a whole new take on the dynamic excellence for which BMW is renowned and blends a modern, elegantly sporty design with the spaciousness and functionality of a four-door Gran Coupe – all while generating zero local emissions.“The BMW Concept i4 brings electrification to the core of the BMW brand,” says Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design. “The design is dynamic, clean and elegant. In short: a perfect BMW that happens to be zero emission.” The drivetrain’s standout numbers include a range of up to 600 km (WLTP), output of up to 530 hp, 0 – 100 km\/h below the display indicate the technical adjustments taking place.“Core” mode introduces the driver’s area to an updated interpretation of the four “widgets” familiar from the display concept of existing models. Here, the graphics reprise the pattern above the air vents and the Gold Bronze accent colour, consciously referencing the car’s interior design. In the area where the central display used to be positioned, a map and widgets now line up alongside one another. The user can navigate around the diagonal widgets using a swipe movement and arrange them intuitively by drag-and-drop. This allows them to adapt the display to their personal preferences.In “Sport” mode, the “widgets” come closer together and create a focussed view. Sideways movements behind the zones are used to show how tight the next corner is, facilitating anticipatory driving. This form of content presentation also allows effective peripheral viewing. The right-hand area of the display shows specific functions in a similar way to BMW M’s lap timer app.“Efficient” mode debuts an “Assisted Driving View”, which shows the driver what the car’s sensors are detecting. This Experience Mode opens up deeper insights into the car’s technology, such as how it communicates with its surroundings. In the BMW Concept i4, the focus here is on anticipatory and efficient driving, and key information for efficient driving is incorporated. The right-hand area of the display shows additional vehicle information, such as the charge level and range. The sound of the BMW Concept i4.The BMW Concept i4 is not only characterised by its individual design, but also by its own visionary and unique sound. It was developed under the brand name of BMW IconicSounds Electric by world renowned composer Hans Zimmer together with BMW Sound Designer Renzo Vitale. BMW IconicSounds Electric aims to emotionalise BMW's electric vehicles and make them audible using individual sound worlds. The sound of the BMW Concept i4 achieves this to perfection – it combines BMW’s past and future. It gives the driver the feeling that there are no limits of expression. The sound is manifold, surprising and it provides a sense of lightness and transparency. The sound worlds of the BMW Concept i4 range from the driving sounds in \"Core\" mode to the more intense and pronounced sounds of \"Sport\" mode. Also included are the sounds of the door opening and the starting scenario. The technology as earmarked for the upcoming BMW i4.Fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology is a defining feature of the BMW i4 and therefore also of future electric mobility. The BMW iX3 due to go into production in 2020 will lead the way in the application of the new tech, which will be introduced in a number of electrically powered BMW vehicles – such as the BMW iNEXT and BMW i4. The electric motor, power electronics, charging unit and high-voltage battery using fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology are all-new developments enabling the BMW Group to take another significant step forward in the field of electrified drive systems. The electric motor developed for the BMW i4 generates maximum output of up to 390 kW\/530 hp, which ranks it alongside a current BMW V8 combustion engine. Its instantaneous power delivery gives the BMW i4 standout performance attributes and exceptional efficiency.The fifth generation of BMW eDrive also brings a newly designed high-voltage battery with the very latest battery cell technology. The version of the battery developed for the BMW i4 impresses with its extremely slim construction and optimised energy density. It weighs roughly 550 kilograms, has an energy content of around 80 kWh and achieves an operating range of up to 600 km in the WLTP cycle.All in all, fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology sets new standards in terms of power density, efficiency and range in locally emission-free driving. Series production of the new BMW i4.Series production of the new BMW i4 will begin in 2021 at the BMW Group’s main plant in Munich. This means that, in the future, combustion-engined vehicles, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles will be manufactured on the same assembly line in Munich.Integrating the BMW i4 into the existing production system represents a challenging task for Plant Munich. The body concept of the BMW i4 differs from the architectures of the vehicle models produced at the plant to date due to the need to accommodate its high-voltage battery. Approximately 90 per cent of the existing production equipment in the body shop can be incorporated into the process, i.e. adapted to manufacture of the i4. However, the remaining ten per cent – especially the machinery involved in building the rear structure – will need to be newly built.A separate new piece of equipment will be fitted in the assembly halls for installation of the high-voltage battery, as the battery needs to be fitted in the car from below. A particular challenge in the conversion\/installation process are the crowded structures of the assembly halls. Working within these tight confines, old machinery will have to be removed and new equipment installed and brought on stream within a six-week period. This requires long-term planning and precise implementation.The company is investing a total of around 200 million euros in Plant Munich to bring series production of the BMW i4 to fruition.\n"}

The first Sunday of the 2020 FIM World Superbike Championship (WorldSBK) at Phillip Island (AUS) did not go as planned for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Tom Sykes (GBR) finished the morning’s Superpole Race in sixth position on his BMW S 1000 RR. In race two in the afternoon, he had to settle with tenth after a technical issue. His team-mate Eugene Laverty (IRL) unfortunately suffered a concussion in a crash in the morning’s warm-up and was declared unfit to race after a check at the Medical Centre. After setting a new lap record on his RR and securing his 50th WorldSBK pole position in Saturday’s Superpole qualifying, Sykes also started Sunday’s Superpole Race from first position on the grid. He finished the extremely closely fought ten lap sprint in sixth position, only 1.6 seconds behind the winner. This also meant P6 on the grid for race two in the afternoon. After the start Sykes was in the mix in the leading group but his efforts and the potential of the RR remained unrewarded as on lap five, a technical issue made him drop down to 12th place. After 22 laps of racing, he took the chequered flag in tenth place. Quotes after race two on Phillip Island. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It has been a disappointing day. Eugene felt extremely comfortable on the bike. So he maybe was a bit over enthusiastic and unfortunately he crashed while being on a very fast lap. The positive aspect, however, is the fact that he clearly has developed a good feeling for the bike. What happened is a pity, but we are glad that he did not sustain any severe injuries apart from concussion. Tom started the morning’s race from pole position. Here we could see that power is still an issue as we are still losing on the straight. Sixth place however was not bad, especially only 1.6 seconds behind the top. The field is extremely close together this year. In race two, he unfortunately suffered a minor technical issue that forced him to quickly restart the bike. It seems, however, that in this race we also could not have maintained the pace in the final stages so we focus on the combination of riding style, chassis and tyre durability. You have to see though that Phillip Island is a challenge in this regard and this could improve at the next races.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First of all, on Eugene’s side I feel really disappointed for him because he certainly turned a corner this morning. He felt as though we had given him a good bike and unfortunately during this morning’s warm up got caught out on a fast lap at T10 and crashed. The crash was a big impact crash and as a result he was left concussed and could not continue further in the two remaining races. To Eugene’s own admission he was a little exuberant to crash but we don’t hold that against him, he was trying his best and we are glad he is relatively okay and will be back for Qatar. Tom really struggled today. The Superpole Race I think was a fair reflection of his speed to get P6, but he was still lacking that top speed which hurts us here. Going into the final race from sixth on the grid, he got a good start and kept in the group but unfortunately had a technical issue mid pack and was lucky not to be collected. He then reset the bike and finished tenth to take a couple of points, but the damage had been done by then as the tyre was too worn to try and catch the front group. We will build on our qualifying and free practice pace which has always been top 6 and try to convert it into good race positions in Qatar.” Tom Sykes: “It’s just been one of those weekends where we have been a bit unlucky. We had an unbelievable qualifying and the pace of the BMW S 1000 RR was really impressive and I felt very comfortable on the bike. In the Superpole Race, I felt really good. There were a few incidents on track which meant I lost around 1.6 seconds which coincidentally was the same gap to the leader at the end of the race, but this was a good step forward for us. Going into the final race, we stuck to our game plan, we got a good start and I just tried a preserve the tyre a little bit. But unfortunately had a little technical issue which lost us a bit of time. It was a disappointment but I tried my best, the team tried their best and we will continue to do so for Qatar.” Eugene Laverty: “Unfortunately I had a crash in warm-up and suffered concussion so the doctors did not allow me to race. I understand their decision, even if it is not easy to accept as a rider but ultimately it is the correct one. I am very disappointed with myself for the crash as the bike was fantastic. It was the first lap of warm-up, I should have been more tentative and I was on course to take first position. I’d needed to take my time and be calmer because I missed a big opportunity for the races today. I’m sorry to the team.” \n"}

Maximilian Günther (GER) gave a tactically astute performance in the Marrakesh E-Prix (MAR) to finish runner-up and take his place on the podium at round five of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E Championship. It was Günther’s second top-three result with BMW i Andretti Motorsport in the #28 BMW iFE.20, having previously taken victory in Santiago (CHI). He climbs into fourth place in the Drivers’ Championship, just behind team-mate Alexander Sims (GBR) in third. Sims also drove an impressive race, but was unfortunately forced to retire from fifth place shortly before the finish. BMW i Andretti Motorsport is currently second in the Team standings with 90 points. Günther started from second place on the grid after a strong performance in qualifying. He set the fastest time in the regular qualifying session, earning himself a point towards the Drivers’ Championship. In the Super Pole, he was only beaten by António Félix da Costa (POR, DS Techeetah), who was just 0.069 seconds quicker. Günther spent much of the early stages of the race, in which efficiency and energy management played a key role, challenging for the lead. Eventual winner Félix da Costa pulled clear in the closing stages, while Günther was embroiled in a spectacular battle for second place with Jean-Éric Vergne (FRA, DS Techeetah). Günther made the decisive overtaking manoeuvre on the final lap. Sims started the race from eighth place and focussed on saving as much energy as possible in the first half of the race. That paid dividends later on in the race and, as he did in Mexico City (MEX), Sims started to fight his way back through the field to fifth place. Shortly before the end of the race, a scrap with Edoardo Mortara (ITA, Venturi) resulted in contact that broke the track rod on the #27 BMW iFE.20. Sims was forced to retire from the race on the final lap. Reactions to the Marrakesh E-Prix: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“Congratulations to Maximilian Günther on the second podium of his young career as a BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver. The BMW iFE.20 made a good impression all weekend in Marrakesh. It was the same story in the race. Maximilian and the team once again gave a very tactically mature performance, made good use of the efficiency of the BMW i drivetrain, and more than deserved second place. The battle with Jean-Éric Vergne in the closing laps was top class! Unfortunately, Alexander Sims’ car suffered a mechanical issue after contact with Edoardo Mortara shortly before the end of the race. At that point he was running fifth after an intelligent race. It is a great shame that he was not rewarded with some points. After five races, our record this season is still very positive. Congratulations to António Félix da Costa on his win.” Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport, team standings: 2nd place):“We came here with high expectations after our performance last year. Maximilian and Alexander impressed in qualifying. We then had a strategic battle with DS Techeetah in the race. We knew that they would be very strong – and we were ultimately unable to stop António. However, Maximilian more than earned his second place with an outstanding performance and great overtaking manoeuvre on the final lap. I feel sorry for Alexander: like in Mexico, he once again produced a fantastic fightback and was set to score a lot of valuable points in fifth place. To be forced out so close to the finish – without, in our opinion, having done anything wrong – is a bitter blow.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, starting position: 8th place, race result: DNF, points: 46, driver standings: 3rd place):“Unfortunately, the race once again showed what a thin line there is between fortune and misfortune in Formula E. I lost a few positions at the start, but was then able to save a lot of energy and win back one place after another with the clever use of ATTACK MODE. It was all looking good until the contact with Edoardo Mortara shortly before the finish, in which my car was damaged. That was that – a real shame. However, congratulations to Maximilian and the team on a deserved podium finish.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, starting position: 2nd place, race result: 2nd place, points: 44, driver standings: 4th place):“I am really very happy with second place. Today was all about managing the race intelligently. In the first half of the race I was still able to challenge António for the lead. In the end, however, he was simply a little bit too good. Congratulations to him on the win. I then had the battle with Jean-Éric towards the end of the race, in which I fortunately came out on top, thanks to a late overtaking manoeuvre.” The BMW i Safety Cars.BMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 6.

The 2020 FIM World Superbike Championship (WorldSBK) started with a bang by the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. In Saturday’s Superpole qualifying of the season opener at Phillip Island (AUS), Tom Sykes (GBR) rode his BMW S 1000 RR to a record pole position. Sykes was then leading half of the distance of race one, before dropping positions and finishing ninth. His new team-mate Eugene Laverty (IRL) was 13th in Superpole and 11th in the race. It was a dream start to the season for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. In Superpole, Sykes was the first rider to go out on the qualifying tyre and rode to a stunning new all-time lap record by setting a time of 1:29,230 minutes. In the remaining minutes, no one was able to beat that and so Sykes, who is the WorldSBK pole record holder, celebrated his 50th pole position in the series. Laverty qualified for 13th place on the grid. Race one of the new season also began perfectly for Sykes on his RR. After a few position changes on the opening corners, the Englishman regained the lead and maintained P1 until the 12th of 22 laps. In the second half of the race, Sykes unfortunately fought with blunt weapons and so had to settle with ninth at the chequered flag. Laverty dropped some positions at the start but then showed great fighting spirit to battle his way back towards the top ten, crossing the line in 11th. Quotes after race one on Phillip Island. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We had a very nice starting position today to kick off the season. Starting from the front row with this view here in Phillip Island is just fantastic. Tom Sykes’ pole position is a great achievement that we deserved. Throughout the week we showed, also in the test, that we can be in the mix. It was of course also great to lead the first 11 laps of the race. Handling of the bike looks very good. Then unfortunately Tom got a tyre issue and as a result the performance dropped sharply. So we have to look at our tyre selection again. Many competitors were on a different tire compound. Eugene Laverty’s performance in qualifying was unfortunately not so strong, which resulted in a relatively poor starting position. On the other hand, he had good pace in the race and was sometimes as fast as the top riders. He fought with Davies and Rinaldi for a long time, was then overtaken again and again on the straight because we still lack engine power here. But Eugene was basically satisfied with the chassis and I think there is a lot of potential. We will attack again tomorrow.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Firstly we are pleased on getting pole position in Superpole with Tom, this gave him a real good chance of a result in race one. Eugene however didn’t make the best use of his qualifying tyre, but he will learn from that and come back stronger. The race obviously was a little disappointing given the great start for Tom who was riding with a lot of confidence and lead for a large proportion of the race. We made a tyre choice which in hindsight wasn’t what most went with, it was the ‘B’ type rear compound tyre which in the latter stages lost grip and that cost many positions. Eugene had a different situation and ran with a few difficulties during the race with engine braking pushing him deep into corners, but he settled into the race well and at one stage was the fastest rider on track. But having starting down in P13 meant he got himself into Davies, Rinaldi and Tom in the closing laps. We will take the information away, work hard over night and hopefully come back stronger tomorrow.” Tom Sykes: “The day started well and with all things considered I have to say I am very happy with a number of things. Certainly qualifying for me was really controlled and I felt really comfortable. The BMW S 1000 RR was working great with the Pirelli qualifying tyre so I was able to do what I wanted and to get a circuit record along with my 50th pole position is some achievement. In the race, we had a good start. It was unfortunate we had a coming together with Jonathan Rea early on, but I settled back in and got into a good rhythm for the first half of the race. Unfortunately, my rear tyre drastically dropped off mid race which is something we didn’t expect and ultimately cost us in race performance, this is something we will work on overnight and make sure we are there or there abouts for tomorrow two races.” Eugene Laverty: “We had a difficult start to the race. Obviously starting from P13 meant we had some work to do in the early stages, but I felt it went better than expected as I was worried we didn’t have the pace to go with the group. Having said that it was clear that some of the riders around us didn’t have such good race pace but for us, that was something we have been working on over the last four days which helped regarding our pace late in the race. We will start again from P13 tomorrow which makes it tough for me, but I will attack and try make up some positions early on.” \n"}

After the tests in Jerez and Portimão we had some open points that we were able to continue and to confirm here in good conditions. Now we have to make our choice for the race weekend. Tom’s pace is strong and we now have to try to keep it over the race distance. With Eugene, we have identified a few things we will work on for the weekend to also further improve his pace. Our goal for the opening round is: we want to start from the front row and I think that we have the chance to get onto the podium.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We’ve had two good days of testing here in Australia. On Eugene’s side, we’ve had a lot of information to work through and we had satisfying results, mostly with the electronics and his feel for the delivery of the power. That has been his focus area and while we are happy so far we will take some of this work into Friday. On Tom’s side we’ve had a huge list of items for him to test over the two days. We are pretty happy with where we are. We’ve not managed to do much race simulation due to the extensive test items, so that will be Fridays focus. We know we can qualify very well and aim to be on the front row in qualifying. But it’s not about qualifying, it’s about the race and we know that to be in contention for a podium position, we need to do consistent fast lap times in the latter parts of race. To do so and to be on the podium is definitely the goal for the season opener.” Tom Sykes: “I’m very happy with the way things have gone. We had very successful winter tests, didn’t get too carried away with the lap times and really focused on the set-up of the BMW S 1000 RR. We really got through a strong test programme and when we came here to Phillip Island, it has paid off. As soon as I rolled out, the bike felt very good and we were able to work on the little parameters that we had in store before the race weekend. Overall, I’m happy with the outcome. We have a lot of information that we will study over next days and we will try to come back strong for the race weekend with a good base set-up. Regarding my goals for the season opener: obviously everybody is here trying to win races. I just want to be more consistent throughout the season but we always have to aim for the podium, always have to try to make that podium into a race win and obviously here it is not different.” Eugene Laverty: “I’m a typical rider, I always want more time, an extra day to be ready but it has been a good couple of test days. We’ve worked a lot towards race preparation because you have concentrate on 20 laps not just on one lap and that has been our focus. We still have some work to do to do that fast lap time as for example Tom has been able to do but I’m confident that we will get there. We need to be fighting up there for the podium because this bike’s capable of it at this track. We’re feeling prepared. We need some more dry time on Friday to find our one lap pace but I’m confident that for the long distance, we will be there.” \n"}

It is a word that really gets the pulses of amateur golfers around the world racing: Fancourt. Located on the fabulous Garden Route, about halfway between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, the Fancourt Golf Resort will host the 30th BMW Golf Cup International World Final this year, from 2nd to 7th March. Around 100 competitors from 33 nations have qualified for the highlight of the 2019 season in recent months. On two extraordinary golf courses – Outeniqua and Montagu – they get to feel like a pro at a majors tournament for a whole week. Both courses were designed by Gary Player and are among the country’s finest.“The 30th anniversary of the BMW Golf Cup International World Final is a special milestone as it emphasises the significance of the amateur golfing commitment for BMW,” said Jörn Plinke, Head of BMW Golfsport Marketing. “We have been offering our guests at the BMW Golf Cup International, and specifically at the World Final, a unique experience for three decades now. We are really looking forward to heading to Fancourt for the anniversary tournament, where we will have the best conditions for this kind of tournament. Breath-taking golf courses, an exclusive resort, a tournament in pro conditions and the fantastic supporting programme – this is what is in store for the world finalists. But primarily the encounters with golfing enthusiasts from 33 countries, who give the event a unique flair.”The world finalists will travel to Western Cape in South Africa with their ‘plus ones’ – where the Pacific and Indian Oceans meet, and golf and nature come together in perfect harmony. With its challenging, but fair courses with a majestic mountain backdrop, the resort offers a complete golfing package in a league of its own. Competitors rooms are also located at the luxurious resort, with a supporting programme designed with great attention to detail rounding off the week, which is set to be an unforgettable one for all competitors.However, a successful week of golf includes more than just the sporting aspect. Golfers have a heart – and so the World Final week also focuses on supporting local projects. This year, BMW’s attention has been drawn to “George Child and Family Welfare” (GCFW). The foundation’s patroness is Fancourt owner Sabine Plattner. For almost 100 years, the charity project has been changing the day-to-day lives of many children and families in and around the city of George for the better – and as part of the World Final, every competitor will have the opportunity to learn all about the projects and to support them.Sustainability is also of paramount importance to the World Final. The installation of mobile drinks stations and the absence of plastic drinking bottles are just some of the measures being put in place to minimise the tournament’s ecological footprint. Every guest will be given a reusable bottle that can be refilled with fresh water at numerous locations on site.A BMW Golf Cup International World Final would not be complete without having a golfing legend as a special guest to hold a Golf Clinic for the finalists and to present the trophies. And who better to take on this role than one of the major players on the golfing scene: eight-time winner of the European Tour Order of Merit, Colin Montgomerie of Scotland. “Monty” will also bring the Ryder Cup trophy with him, which he won as a player five times and as the captain in 2010.The World Final will be divided into three categories: Men’s Category A (up to HCP 12), Men’s Category B (HCP 13-28) and Ladies (HCP up to 28). In addition to the titles in these singles categories, there will also be a nations ranking. This was won by Team China at the last edition in Mexico; however, they and the joint team from Hong Kong and Macau have both withdrawn from the competition as a precautionary measure due to the Corona virus.\n"}

Famous influencer and photographer Brooklyn Beckham had the exclusive opportunity of a photo shoot with the BMW i8 Safety Car in its new design that was presented to the world last Thursday. Beckham has a huge fan base on Instagram with 12 million followers. He had already got familiar with the BMW i8 Roadster *, when he drove it at the Coachella Festival 2019. Now he has added the driving experience with the BMW i8 Safety Car. In an interview he talks about his experience at the Mexico City E-Prix and the challenges of photographing a car. Mr. Beckham, how do you sum up your experience at Mexico City?Brooklyn Beckham: “It was an amazing experience. Thank you to BMW i Motorsport for the opportunity. On Thursday we had a great filming and photo session at some really unique locations. It was fun working with the BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car and I think we created some really cool stuff. On Friday I even had the chance to drive the car on the racetrack myself and as a passenger of Safety Car driver Bruno Correia.” What is the challenge of photographing a car, compared to taking pictures of other objects or people?Beckham: “I find photographing a car more challenging as you can’t catch a moment of someone’s personality. When I photograph people I try to capture a specific emotion and with a car you have to create the whole environment from scratch and need to consider quite a lot of technical requirements like reflections, angles and colour grading, for example. All this together makes the project very challenging and exciting.” How does the new extraordinary design of the BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car inspire you as a photo artist?Beckham: “When I saw the new BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car my eyes lit up because it was a completely new design that I have never seen before and that always excites me. The car just looks stunning to me.” At the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival you got behind the wheel of the BMW i8 Roadster. Now you have driven the sister Safety Car as well. Can you describe what you particularly like about the car?Beckham: “The BMW i8 Roadster was the perfect car for me to drive to Coachella 2019; it’s small, quick, and most importantly environmentally friendly. When I drove the safety car here at Mexico City it was such an incredible experience for me. I really enjoyed every minute of it.” The Mexico City E-Prix was the first Formula E race where you are live on site. Can you understand what so many people find captivating about racing?Beckham: “I’ve always been into racing cars ever since I can remember so was really excited to attend the race with BMW. And I haven’t been disappointed. It was a great experience and the atmosphere was so electric.” Formula E is a fully-electric racing series. You like cool cars. How cool is electric mobility for a 20-year-old like you?Beckham: “Electric cars are so incredible to me. The whole technology behind it is really impressive. Most importantly they’re eco friendly and I personally find them more sleek and sexy.”\n"}

A clever race strategy and an equally efficient performance from the BMW i drivetrain helped Alexander Sims (GBR) to move up 13 places during the Mexico City E-Prix (MEX) and finish the fourth race of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship season in fifth position. He also claimed an extra point for the fastest lap of the race. Sims is now in second place in the drivers’ championship with 46 points, just one behind new leader Mitch Evans (NZL, Jaguar), who won the race in Mexico. BMW i Andretti Motorsport remains at the top of the team standings, with 71 points. No-one had expected such a strong result after the qualifying session ended. Sims and Maximilian Günther (GER) struggled to find the perfect set-up and had to be content with starting from 18th and 16th positions on the grid. Sims drove a clever race right from the start, managing his energy reserves very well as he progressed gradually through the field. Fifth place and the fastest lap of the race were his just reward for a faultless drive and an excellent strategy. Günther had more problems as he battled to assert himself in the midfield and finished the race in eleventh place. Reactions to the Mexico City E-Prix: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“Congratulations to Alexander Sims and the entire BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team on this fantastic recovery performance to finish fifth after starting 18th on the grid! After the disappointment of qualifying, we made the right decisions for the race. We opted for a cautious approach with the energy in the BMW i drivetrain and, unlike our rivals, we did not make any mistakes. Unfortunately, things did not go according to plan for Maximilian Günther this time and he got caught up in some midfield battles. The fact that Alexander drove the fastest lap of the race shows just how fast the BMW iFE.20 can go. We have held on to first place in the team standings and Alexander is second in the drivers’ championship. That all means that we are feeling good as we leave Mexico City. Many thanks to the Mexican fans and the organisers for this unbelievable atmosphere in the stadium. Just seeing it is enough to give you goose bumps.” Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport, team standings: 1st place):“After the poor qualifying result, we can be more than pleased with the fifth place for Alexander Sims. He gave an outstanding performance after starting the race so far back. Thanks to him, we have extended our lead in the team standings and we are very close to first place in the drivers’ championship. That is a very positive way to finish the weekend. Unfortunately, things didn’t go well for Maximilian Günther all day. Now he has to write the weekend off and look ahead.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, starting position: 18th place, race result: 5th place, points: 46, driver standings: 2nd place):“After this qualifying session, the race itself was a major challenge for us. However, we were able to save much more energy than our rivals in the first section of the race, which we were able to use later for the chase. I had a really strong car during the race. Overall, it is fantastic to finish a race day that had started in such a disappointing way with such a good result.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, starting position: 16th place, race result: 11th place, points: 25, driver standings: 8th place):“That was not our day. Firstly, we will have to take a look at what went wrong. For whatever reason, we just did not have the speed required in qualifying. Things did not improve for me in the race – in contrast to Alexander, who really produced a great catch-up performance. At the moment, I can only speculate as to the root cause, but there is no point doing that. We will analyse everything in detail and see what we can do better.” The BMW i Safety Cars.BMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 6.

Aspiring Terrain: Highway: 195km, gravel \/ mountain track: 180km Tests: SP18: ‘Akrapovic Challenge’, SP19: ‘Gate clutch start’ Top three teams: 1. South Africa, 2. Italy, 3. France ->","completion":" Mt. Aspiring, New Zealand. Day seven of the 2020 BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy saw the GS riders head further south, exchanging the high country of the Mackenzie Basin for the first reaches of the Upper Otago, not an easy transition as mountains are constant barriers to movement here in the South Island. The smallest lines of weakness – passes and gorges – are typically the only way to reach new territory and so it was the GS Trophy route negotiated four mountain passes and plenty of water crossings before the riders were allowed to reach the camp at Lake Wanaka, which in the early evening sat in the shadow of the imposing Mount Aspiring (a world heritage site).Such is the scenic drama of these high country regions they have been made world famous by the filming here of the ‘Lord of the Rings’ movies; but the land here has a long and real history of its own and men have mined these areas for years, whether it was the Maori searching for green stone (jade) or the European pioneers drawn by the gold rush of the late 19th century.The GS riders had enjoyed gold of different nature in the truly magnificent sunrise over Lake Wanaka before setting off for their first test of the day, the Akrapovic Challenge, found just 30km along the track to the Hakataramea Pass. This test required all three team riders to ride a parcour that was part gravel floor part inclined bank with tricky cambered turns that overturned a few. Against the clock, the riders balanced attack with technique, and for the leading teams of South Africa and France it was evident both were taking a measured tactic of being fast but not erratic – a mistake at this point in the competition could prove difficult to reverse.After the test the riders continued up the pass on a flowing trail that allowed long glances westward toward the Southern Alps where the snowy peak of Mt. Cook (Aoraki by its Maori name) – at 3724m New Zealand’s highest mountain – was lit by the orange and gold rays from the morning sun.Once over this pass the route veered westward into Danseys Pass, an altogether more technical trail where the steep valley sides closed in tight – as did flocks of the Merino sheep, which repeated blocked the trail! At the head of the pass the riders could at last take their break for lunch at the Danseys Pass Hotel – as remote an establishment as you’ll ever find. Upon leaving the pass again the mountains were thrilling the riders with their beauty as clouds tumbled like waterfalls from the peaks.When away from the mountains the route passed along the high country where smaller hills slipped between the pastures and occasional crop fields. Small towns drifted by, like Naseby and Wedderburn with their history embedded in gold mining – you can still see the odd abandoned miner’s hut rusting away – but today these communities rely mostly on agriculture to sustain them.In the afternoon the route took in one last high pass, up through Thomson Gorge, and at the highest point the riders found their second test of the day, ‘Gate clutch start’. Here the teams, starting from the gate at the head of the pass, had to bump start a BMW F 850 GS in the shortest possible distance. That’s start and stop, with the engine still running after the crash braking. Here again some played safe allowing themselves a good few metres to gain momentum before bump starting the GS and hitting the brakes. Braver teams, like Russia, successfully gambled on just two turns of a wheel before dropping the clutch catching the engine and braking – all done in less than five metres.Test complete it was a last run downhill to Lake Wanaka, although this trail was peppered with water crossings and gates, so something of a stop-start affair. Wanaka is set in a huge glacier-formed valley, with fields dotted with giant rocks. The Pisa Hills stood to stop the riders from heading too far south while ahead the Southern Alps were again an imposing dark wall of rock that stood as barrier to the west coast.The ride from Rotorua, across two islands, has been magnificent, at times challenging but always inspiring. Now the GS Trophy riders have just one more day to savour this most dramatic and beautiful of countries. And for the few that are in contention for the GS Trophy itself there’s still the nerve-wracking final grand-parcours which will determine the new champions. One more day, but memories that will last a lifetime. \n"}

New partnership, new car design: ahead of the Mexico City E-Prix (MEX), BMW i made two important public announcements. Firstly, BMW i has extended the contract as ‘ABB FIA Formula E Official Vehicle Partner’ and will continue to equip Formula E with an extensive fleet of BMW i safety vehicles through Season 6 and beyond. Secondly, the BMW i8 Safety Car will appear in a spectacular new design from the fourth race of the season onwards. The announcement about the partnership extension took place during an evening event held by BMW i and Founding Main Partner Julius Bär in Mexico City, where the car was also revealed. Guests included Dr. Andreas Aumann, Vice President BMW i Product, eMobility, Pia Schörner, Head of BMW Motorsport Marketing, Jamie Reigle, Chief Executive Officer of Formula E, and the internationally renowned influencer Brooklyn Beckham, who got the chance to take some exclusive photos with the new Safety Car ahead of the race. “BMW i has played a pivotal role in the success of Formula E since the start of the championship,” said Jamie Reigle, Chief Executive Officer of Formula E. “Not only as a founding partner, but also as a strong competitor and manufacturer currently leading the team standings. I am extremely pleased to continue our collaboration together as official vehicle partner long into the future. It shows BMW’s commitment as a leader in electric mobility.” In addition to being ‘Official Vehicle Partner’, BMW i also provides the car fleet for the popular ‘BMW i VIP Laps’, the taxi rides on the racetrack that take place during Formula E events around the world. BMW i is also ‘Official Partner’ and ‘Founding Partner’ of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. “As a pioneer in the field of electromobility, and a founding member of Formula E, we are proud to extend our long collaboration and to support the series as ‘Official Vehicle Partner’ with our extensive fleet of support cars in Season 6 and beyond,” said Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President Customer & Brand BMW. “One highlight is obviously our BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car, which we presented in Mexico with a spectacular new design. It is the first and only Roadster to be used as a safety car. Right from the word go, BMW i has played an active role in shaping the rapid development of Formula E for automobile manufacturers, companies and fans all over the world. From the very first minute, we have believed in the concept and used the inspiring environment to test our pioneering BMW i technology and innovations under competitive conditions in the technology lab that is Formula E, and to present them to the public.” Safety Car design aligned with the colours of the light bar.The BMW i8 Safety Car, which BMW i is making available as a Coupé and as a Roadster, also boasts a future-oriented and innovative new design. As was the case for the BMW iFE.20, the Safety Car has been designed by Michael Scully, Head of Design BMW Group Motorsport. It carries forward some elements of its predecessor. These include the blue and white corners, crossing over in the style of the BMW logo. Emphasis is also placed on the view from above, which plays a particularly important role due to the elevated seating location for many spectators at the Formula E races. Then there is the asymmetrical layout that provides maximum visibility at high speed. As with the race car, the non-reflective, matt black cockpit element that has been extended to cover the entire area around the driver represents the most striking change. This pushes the driver to the fore, underlining the core importance of this role. “We integrated the colours of the light bar into the design specially for the Safety Car. This makes the striking colour scheme for the car extremely authentic,” says Scully. BMW i has long enjoyed a close connection with Formula E, appearing as ‘Official Vehicle Partner’ since Season 1. BMW i Andretti Motorsport has also been racing competitively since Season 5. After two wins in three races from Alexander Sims (GBR) and Maximilian Günther (GER), the team is currently heading the team standings. In addition to celebrating sporting successes, the BMW iFE.20 race car is used primarily as a technological laboratory for further development of drivetrain concepts for BMW i production cars. The Formula E project has seen the most intensive technology transfer between motorsport and series production in the history of BMW. The BMW i Safety Cars.BMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 6.

BMW M Motorsport’s preparations for the 2020 DTM season are in full swing. This week, the BMW M4 DTM returned to the track at a three-test test at Vallelunga, Italy. In action were drivers Philipp Eng (AUT) and Timo Glock (GER), who completed an intensive programme of testing from Wednesday to Friday. Predominantly sunny weather made for nearly consistently good conditions over the three days at the racetrack to the north of Rome. This allowed BMW M Motorsport to work through all the test points scheduled with the modified BMW M4 DTM. Different technical ideas for the coming season were evaluated in a number of short and long runs. In total, Eng and Glock completed 460 laps – that is 1,851 kilometres of testing. Joining them in Italy were the two newcomers to the BMW works squad for the 2020 DTM, Lucas Auer (AUT) and Jonathan Aberdein (RSA). They used the test days to get to know the team and processes at BMW M Motorsport. The next test is scheduled for 16th to 18th March at Monza (ITA). All the BMW DTM drivers will be in action at this official ITR test. The opening round of the season takes place at Zolder (BEL) from 24th to 26th April. Quotes on the DTM test at Vallelunga. Philipp Eng: “We are very happy with the test. It was great to feel how much positive energy there is in the team, and to see how much hard work has been put in over the winter. Everyone is fully motivated. As a driver, that gives me an extremely good feeling. Out on the track, we confirmed that we have been able to implement everything we resolved to do. The car is really very easy to drive. We have taken a further step forward and I am now looking forward to the next test in Monza.” Timo Glock: “It was very nice to be back in the car after the long break. When I arrived in the paddock on the first morning, I realised that this is my 20th year in motor racing, if I deduct the karting years. And I still have butterflies in my stomach when I walk through the paddock, and look forward to getting behind the wheel of a racing car. I had a big smile on my face for the first few laps. I really enjoyed it. The car felt good and we were able to work through some of the points on our list. It was a positive test and we must now make sure we sort everything else out in Monza and continue to prepare well for the season.” Lucas Auer: “It was a very interesting test for me. I have seen all the processes at BMW, got to know everyone in the team, and obviously also watched what Philipp and Timo were up to on the track. I am now very excited about Monza, where I will be at the wheel of the BMW M4 DTM myself.” Jonathan Aberdein: “It has been great to be at Vallelunga preparing for the 2020 DTM season. My role at this test was to spectate, to get to know the team and to learn how everything is operating and running. It has been valuable for me to gather this information. Now I can’t wait to get behind the wheel of the BMW M4 DTM myself at the next test at Monza.” \n"}

The GS riders crossed the South Island west to east, riding 440 km over mountain passes and along the Canterbury Plain to reach Lake Tekapo, in the foothills of the Southern Alps, in the early evening. Along the way they encountered yet more mountain tracks, made multiple river crossings and, as Team Middle East were keen to point out, they’d been through that famous Kiwi experience: four seasons in one day.The GS Trophy riders started the day as they always do, with a 5:30 am call to breakfast ready for a 7 am start. They then enjoyed a dawn ride along the west coast, heading south from Punakaiki Beach toward the port town of Greymouth. The one test of the day came early, just half an hour from the start. In ‘Rent-a-Ride’ the teams were challenged to ride a trials course twice, with two different riders recording as near as identical times as they could manage. With no timing devices permitted it came down to the third member of the team to pace the riders. At the same time, of course, they needed to ride the course immaculately with no footing or stops. And as part of the course was also submerged, it was a tricky enterprise start-to-finish.Test finished, the GS riders passed through the Victorian gold rush town of Greymouth (which latterly became a port, and a farming and timber town, although these days tourism is an equal contributor to the economy). From here the GS riders turned inland, taking Arthur’s Pass to cross the mountains and enter the Canterbury Plain, although first came the Canterbury High Country where dramatic limestone escarpments rose tall in testament to the significant seismic activity that regularly reshapes the South Island.Gravel roads then brought the GS riders across the gentler Canterbury Plain where for the first time on this cross-islands adventure arable farming mixed with pastoral as sheep and cows grazed next to fields of wheat and barley – a gentle calm beauty after the drama of the mountains. After a late lunch in Geraldine, the GS riders then took to the hills again, riding through the sheep stations of the Mackenzie Country where they found technical riding in the rocky climbs and descents and challenge in the many water crossings, as rocks and loose stone unseated more than a few.The day ended at Lake Tekapo, located almost plumb centre of the South Island. The lake is in fact a reservoir built in the 1970s – it takes its sparkling blue-green hue from the silica found in the glacial waters that feed it – and is part of an extensive hydro scheme that provides New Zealand with 85% of its total energy needs. Along with energy taken from geo-thermal sources, New Zealand is close to achieving a total renewable, sustainable energy supply. With riders arriving in camp after 6 pm it had been another 11 hours riding day. Although only one test was completed the riders were more than happy given the challenge of the day’s riding and the never-ending spectacular scenery. Rider quotes: Jorge Osorio, Team Middle East: “What an amazing day! We start with a nice test, very technical. Then we rode up the mountain pass, we saw massive slopes with waterfalls and a huge viaduct – and shivered in the falling temperature! The views were like we’ve never seen before – beautiful. And then we came to this amazing off-road route where we crossed glacial rivers and were riding up really technical climbs, it was amazing. And through it all we got to experience what the Kiwi’s call ‘four seasons in one day’, we had the cold, the rain and now the sunshine. Incredible.” Gleb Koltsov, Team Russia:“I came here as the team journalist but after we lost one of the riders due to visa issues I’ve become a participant too! And making me a participant is like an adventure – a real adventure – because I didn’t expect to be here in this situation; I didn’t prepare, I’d never ridden the BMW F 850 GS before. So now I’m doing every challenge, it’s a real challenge for me – and very exciting, if exhausting when I have to write my story every evening. Today, we’ve had a typical day for us – where we start the first test with a fail! But after that we relax and feel the emotions of the ride. Today was a great route. Our marshal, Jean-Luc took us on the toughest route, with big hills and so many river crossings, this has probably made it the best day of the trip so far. So thank you to Jean-Luc, it’s been amazing.” Isabela Londomo Rivas, Team Int. Female Team II:“Today was incredible. Very long, 440 km I think, with a spectacular route with gravel, rocks, hills, lots of river crossings and all the time the views were amazing. Today we rode together with the second international female team and being the first to leave in the morning we made it our joint mission to make it first to the camp at the end of the day. And we did this. So okay, it’s not a race – but we won!” BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2020 Oceania.Day 6 overall standings:1 South Africa 3092 France 3023 Italy 2874 Brazil 2605 South Korea 2586 Netherlands 2417 Russia 2398 Middle East 2179 Australia 2159 Latin America 21511 USA 21112 Argentina 19813 Japan 18713 Mexico 18715 Nordic 18016 UK 17217 India 16618 Thailand 16519 Malaysia 15720 Int.

A private customer team will compete with BMW Turbo Power in the DTM for the first time in the 2020 season. French team ART Grand Prix returns to the series and will run a BMW M4 DTM. This sees the number of BMW race cars on the grid rise to seven. At the wheel of the privately-run BMW M4 DTM for the 2020 DTM season will be a well-known driver, with Robert Kubica (POL) set to make his debut in the touring car series. The 35-year-old took to the track in the BMW M4 DTM for the first time at the DTM Young Driver Tests at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) in December. “This is really great news for the DTM,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “We are delighted to welcome ART Grand Prix to the DTM as a private customer team. It has always been our goal to make the DTM field even larger and more attractive with privately-run BMW M4 DTMs. There were several options and we have held many discussions with potential teams in recent months. Considering all the aspects, we opted for the package provided by ART Grand Prix. After the test in Spain last December, Robert Kubica made no secret of the fact that he could imagine a future in the DTM. It is great that ART Grand Prix is now allowing him the opportunity to contest the 2020 season in a BMW M4 DTM. Robert showed during the test that is very good in a DTM car. He is a real asset to the series. We have our fingers crossed for ART Grand Prix and Robert, and hope they have a successful DTM season.” “No need to introduce BMW, Robert Kubica or the DTM! Their fabulous careers speak for themselves,” said ART Grand Prix team principal Sébastien Philippe. “This project is important to us and we have been putting a lot of energy into it over the winter. It is with great pride that we will undertake it with the ambition to honour a historic car manufacturer, BMW, which has won several titles in the most demanding passenger car championship. Our goal will also be to accompany Robert Kubica, who is about to write a new page in his already incredibly rich motorsport career. Our last participation in the DTM series dates all the way back to 2015\/16, so ART Grand Prix will need to relearn the inner workings of this high-level championship. Our objectives will be modest at the start of the season, but with the determination of our team, I hope that we will progress from the start of the season to fight with the frontrunners.” “The DTM has appealed to me for a long time – and the test in December at Jerez de la Frontera really gave me a taste for more,” said Kubica. “I am really looking forward to starting this new chapter in my motorsport career. I believe the DTM is one of the strongest and best race series in the world. I immediately felt at home in the BMW M4 DTM at the test. ART Grand Prix has been a big name on the international motor racing scene for years. I am sure we can achieve a lot together in the DTM. We obviously still have to gain experience compared to the established DTM teams, but we will work hard to ensure that we improve all the time. I can hardly wait to race in the DTM.” The team, from Villeneuve-La-Guyard (FRA), was formed in 2005. ART Grand Prix is an established name on the international motorsport scene. The team is primarily known for its many successes in various Formula series, right up to GP2 and Formula 2. Team Principal Sébastien Philippe’s crew has helped many renowned racing drivers on their route to the top. ART Grand Prix has already competed in the DTM in 2015 and 2016, claiming a total of four podium finishes. In preparation for the season, ART Grand Prix and Kubica will attend the ITR test at Monza (ITA) from 16th to 18th March. The 2020 season kicks off at Zolder (BEL) from 24th to 26th April. \n"}

Today’s stage was something of a liaison as the 2020 BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy transitioned from the North Island to the South Island of New Zealand. The GS riders had interpreted this as a chance to rest and recharge their batteries, only with a 3:30 am call to breakfast – so as to catch the early inter-island ferry – they soon realised, like Int. GS Trophy riders before them, that there really is no rest in this competition until the finish.Nonetheless, today was a great opportunity for the GS riders to share experiences, as with three hours on the ferry they had plenty of time for inter-team chats. Albeit that was after they had completed their first challenge of the day – the ‘40 years of GS Quiz’ in which they were tested on their knowledge of this iconic motorcycle that has become so much more than just a brand. In fact it was a ferry ride in three parts: knowledge test, sleep and sight seeing, the latter coming as the ferry made its way down the spectacular Queen Charlotte Sound to the port of Picton.In Picton the GS Trophy riders created a stir as all 140 F 850 GS motorcycles disembarked the ferry together, followed by the vast entourage of cars and trucks that support the event. Once out of Picton – which took all of two minutes, it’s that small – the GS riders enjoyed a scenic ride through the Marlborough Sounds. Although this region is world famous for its wine production, the route followed the national park trail along the sounds and then up into the valleys before reaching the small town of Havelock (population: 486) where the GS riders gratefully stopped for a coffee break, or maybe for something cooler as the temperature was uncharacteristically hovering around a sweltering 30ºC. From here it was a short ride to Pelorus Bridge where they found their campsite set deep in a forest, one which was again peppered with New Zealand natives such as totara, beech and rimu.Even the early afternoon finish was not an opportunity to rest as the GS riders found two more challenges waiting for them. First was the ‘GPS Challenge’ in which the teams took their BMW Motorrad Navigator VI GPS units and had to find their way – on foot – through the forest to find another Navigator VI unit from which they extracted data to be reported to the marshal at the end of the challenge. Warm work, running through the forest in the heat of the afternoon.No sooner had they finished this, than the riders were shepherded to the ‘Metzeler Challenge’ where they needed to demonstrate their prowess with the tools, changing the rear wheel on their F 850 GS. Again, as this was against the clock the teams needed to have intimate knowledge of the wheel spacers, chain run and brake arrangement if they were to set a fast time.So the event has reached its halfway point and while the competition is hotting up, particularly with the top three being so close on points, the going from here is set to get progressively more testing with big days ahead in the big country. It’s going to be the strong and the skilled who’ll prevail.Finally, as if there could be any more to do, this evening the teams submitted their images for the second GS Trophy photo contest. Public voting for the photo competition will open at 00:00 (GMT+13 New Zealand time) on February 13 and remains open for 24 hours. Go to www.gstrophy.com for full details on how to vote. Rider Quotes:Jaap van Hoofwegen, Team Netherlands:“We’ve had a great start to the competition. It’s an amazing experience, meeting new people every day and riding through incredible scenery. This is the first Int. GS Trophy for the Netherlands and we were hoping to do well, so we’re actually quite chuffed with how we are doing. Today we have had what’s been described as something of a rest day, but we’d have to say setting your alarm for 3:30 am to pack your tent does not feel like resting! Anyway, we’re looking forward to the second half of the competition where we expect the temperatures to get cooler – maybe! – the scenery to get bigger and the challenges tougher.” Ronnie Lundberg, Team Nordic: “This is our first Int. GS Trophy since 2010, so it’s great to be here. We are enjoying every second of it, it’s been great riding on the beaches and making friends from around the world. The scenery is amazing. On day one we said, ‘woah, this is the best scenery we’ve ever seen!’ but our marshal said ‘wait, it gets better’. And he was right, every day is more magnificent. And the bike, the F 850 GS, we love the bike – the suspension, the power, the way it’s so narrow, it’s great in the gravel, great on the road, across everything as GS stands for. It’s a sport bike, it’s an everything-you-want bike!” Assada Porananond, Team Thailand“I’m Team Thailand’s journalist. It’s been very exciting, my three guys are having a very unique experience. They’re also feeling exhausted, because of the change of temperature from day to night – they’re not used to the cold nights and mornings. Right now they are asleep on the top deck of the ferry, hopefully getting their energy back ready for what’s to come, which we understand will be more adventurous still! We love riding with the other teams, we are not the best with the English language but motorcycling – and the GS – is a common passion and that breaks down the barriers. And the SENA communications units have really helped us, we can talk all the time!” BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2020 Oceania.

{"prompt":"Synopsis of Day 3. Location: Wainui, North Island, New Zealand  Weather: Sun, 22-28ºC Course: 345km, Castlepoint to Wainui Terrain: Gravel 180km, trail 10km, highway 155km  Tests: SP6: Beach Drift, SP7: White Rock Leatt Neck Brace Challenge; SP8: Trial Top three teams: 1. South Korea, 2. South Africa, 3. Netherlands  ->","completion":" Wainui, New Zealand. There was a concerted push south today as the 2020 BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy looked to finish the day within striking distance of the Cook Strait, ready for a leap onto the South Island tomorrow. Only first there was nearly 350km of mixed trail and highway, through the never ending hills of the Wairarapa, diving into native woodlands, crossing pastoral flatlands then a return to the spectacular east coast before finally crossing the Rimutaka Range to make camp in the bush on the edge of Wellington, New Zealand’s capital city. The GS riders again responded to a pre-dawn 5:30am call to breakfast, yet again finding wonder in the incredible sunrise over the Pacific Ocean, this time seen over the reef at Castlepoint. Less than a kilometre from the start they stopped for the first challenge of the day, Beach Drift. Here one rider from each team rode against the clock over a deep sand section, then crossed back and forth across flatter sands before making a precision stop in a defined box. The deep sand claimed many victims, either tipping over or sinking deep, including the hitherto infallible Team South Korea. From here the riders enjoyed riding a hard pack farmer’s trail over spectacular cliffs to Waimimi – just another small name on the map marking the location of a handful of farming homesteads. Here the riders turned inland toward Masterton, the Wairarapa’s market town. A mix of flowing roads and twisting gravel tracks, much of it through native forest sections, took the riders east and as they crossed the highpoint of 536m at Pariwhariki they could see in the distance the impressive, brooding Tararau Range that divides the southern half of the North Island, with peaks reaching 1300 metres.After a refuel and coffee break in the quaint historic town of Martinborough the riders then headed east again – not south! – On the gravel tracks that lead to the iconic White Rock at Pahaoa. The beach here is black sand which contrasts starkly with the solitary white rock that somehow holds steady in the immense raging surf – this is no swimming spot! Here the GS riders were entertained by the Leatt Neck Brace Challenge, hurling their gloves up the beach into the neck braces in something resembling target practice! The final leg of today’s journey saw the GS riders swoop over the Rimutakas on the biker-famous Rimutaka Hill Road – a favourite weekend haunt of Wellington’s bike riders. The curves are entertaining, but either side of the road (which peaks at 725m) is a vast dense native bush with manuka, beech, cabbage trees, hebe and ferns. New Zealand almost as it was when Captain Cook first arrived. Only the action didn’t end here as the teams again had to elect a rider to ride the final challenge of the day: the Trial, a weaving track that led through the trees and through a stream on the edge of the bush that borders the campground for tonight. Of course this was set against the clock, with time deductions for footing and stalls. While it was a typically late end to the riding day it was an early turn-in for sleep as tomorrow the GS Trophy makes a very early pre-dawn start for the inter-island ferry to the South Island. Quotes: Andrea Padovani, Team Italy: “It’s been a very hard and beautiful spirit riding the GS Trophy, we are every day riding hard to make our goals. Sometimes it is difficult, sometimes easy, but we go on and see what each day brings. The days are hard because we ride for many hours, but we are enjoying it because the landscape is beautiful – New Zealand is something amazing, different to all we know. We have enjoyed the Sena communications; riding with the Australians today they talk so much! But yesterday we rode with the first female team and they said we speak a lot. The Sena is a challenge to us, though, for being Italians we speak not just with our voice, but with our hands and our faces!” Brandon Grimsted, Team South Africa: “The event has been thrilling, lots of excitement, so we’ve experienced lots of nerves. We’ve had a lot of supportive feedback from our fans and friends back at home, and placed fourth we’re in a good position in the competition, so we will put these past days behind us and push on. Today we had a shaky start – BJ (Vosloo) was maybe too aggressive in the first test, but Cobus (Theron) likes his technical riding and so scored us a clean ride in the trial. A good day. But New Zealand – it leaves me speechless, it’s an incredible country!” Cleuci Ronzella, Team Brazil: “This is some event! The views are amazing, the route is amazing – but we need to rest, there’s been so much riding in the last three days. All the same, we simply don’t have the words to explain how we feel, this is an incredible experience. We hope to go better in the next days, we will find our strength.” BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2020 Oceania.Day Three overall standings:1 South Korea 157 points2 South Africa 146 3 Netherlands 145 4 France 1425 Italy 133 6 USA 1247 Australia 1228 Russia 114 9 Latin America 111 10 Brazil 109 11 Mexico 105 12 Argentina 10113 Middle East 93 14 UK 7915 India 7816 Nordic 7717 Malaysia 6718 Japan 6219 North Africa 6220 Thailand 6221 Int.

BMW Motorsport heads into the sim racing season with a varied programme and is prominently represented on a host of virtual racing platforms. In the BMW SIM 120 Cup, teams and drivers from around the world compete at the wheel of the BMW M8 GTE on the iRacing motorsport simulation. The BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup will be hosted on the rFactor2 platform. Participants will battle for prize money of almost 75,000 Euros across all competitions. Like last year, a grand BMW SIM Motorsport finale is planned: The best and most successful professional and amateur drivers qualify for the BMW SIM Live event in Munich (GER). “Our two SIM Cups with the BMW M8 GTE on iRacing and the BMW M2 CS Racing on rFactor2 form the basis for our virtual racing programme in 2020,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “They allow us to address talented and enthusiastic drivers on many different levels and provide them with a route into the fascinating world of motorsport. We are also planning continual expansion of our range of cars on the relevant platforms.” Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand Experience, added: “With BMW SIM Motorsport we are going our own BMW way in sim racing. We are closely linking the content and event side of our commitment with our activities at BMW i and M Motorsport. At the same time, we are addressing new target groups – in the sim community and outside of it. In 2020, our fans will have the opportunity at many actual racing events to qualify for our grand finale in Munich – BMW SIM Live. In this way, we are addressing both passionate sim racers and amateur gamers alike and will bring them together at BMW SIM Motorsport. The whole segment is really gaining momentum and BMW is actively shaping the scene.” The eSports sector has been a growth market for years. eGamers across the world go head to head online in sport and non-sport simulations. As well as this, they also compete at popular offline events all over the world. The fan base for the different eSports disciplines is expanding at great speed. This is particularly true of virtual motor racing. BMW SIM 120 Cup kicked off in Daytona.On 12th January, around 800 drivers competed in the initial BMW SIM 120 Cup event on the iRacing sim racing platform. At the virtual ‘Daytona International Speedway’ (USA), Maximilian Wenig (GER) and Maximilian Benecke (GER) from Team Redline GT claimed victory in the BMW M8 GTE – each securing prize money of 1,200 US dollars and a ticket for BMW SIM Live 2020. A further five BMW SIM 120 Cup events will be held over the course of the season. The calendar next takes sim racers to Sebring (USA), the Nürburgring (GER), Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), Road Atlanta (USA) and Interlagos (BRA). In each two-hour race, two drivers will share driving duties at the wheel of the BMW M8 GTE. Prize money is not restricted to the winners, as the second and third-placed drivers can also each look forward to receiving 600 and 300 US dollars respectively. BMW works drivers will also appear regularly in the BMW SIM 120 Cup. Nick Catsburg (NED) and Philipp Eng (AUT) claimed 13th place as BMW Team CATENG at the first race of the season in early January. In addition to the BMW SIM 120 Cup events, iRacing also offers users the new BMW 12.0 Series. The BMW M8 GTE is the car of choice for these 12-minute sprint races, which take place on different tracks every week. The championship debuted at the start of December 2019 and is very popular among the users. The BMW M8 GTE is also a firm favourite at the big iRacing special events, where participants can choose their own cars and compete in endurance races. At the virtual 24 Hours of Daytona, 374 teams were competing in BMWs, completing more than 235,000 laps as the race progressed. The Nürburgring as a virtual school – in the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup.For the races in the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup, BMW Motorsport is working with the rFactor2 platform. The new entry-level model in the BMW M Customer Racing range will be used for the races. The BMW M2 CS Racing made its virtual and actual debut in public at 2019 BMW SIM Live on 5th December 2019. The competition’s ten events are all about the Nürburgring (GER). Each event takes the sim racers closer to another aspect of the iconic racetrack – whether it be different layouts or extreme weather conditions. This also makes the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup the ideal stage for the three members of the new BMW Junior Team – Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) – who will compete in all the races on their simulators. The race winners each receive 1,000 Euros in prize money and a starting place at the season-ending event in Munich. The winner of the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup finale will also have the opportunity to drive the actual BMW M2 CS Racing out on the track. Fans can also become BMW racing drivers at the circuit.The BMW SIM Fan Cup also gives BMW Motorsport fans the chance to qualify for BMW SIM Live 2020. At many actual racing events in the IMSA series, the DTM and the ABB FIA Formula E Championship, as well as the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring, they can strive to set fast lap times over the course of the race weekend in a special sim area. The fastest time of the weekend receives a starting place in the BMW SIM Fan Cup Finale at the season-ending event.

The 2020 BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy enjoyed a spectacular opening stage today as the competitors set off from the thermal springs and Maori homelands in Rotorua to travel through native forest, up onto pastoral high country before descending to Hawke’s Bay for a first camp on the trails, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The GS Trophy riders were up before dawn, striking camp ahead of a 5:30am breakfast call in preparation for the 7am start – that breakfast being very important with no less than 11 hours of riding ahead. After passing by the first volcano of the tour, the 821m cone of Putauaki (Mt. Edgecumbe), the route took the riders into the native forests of the Huiarau Ranges, where gravel roads followed the river valleys upstream, each turn revealing new natural highlights of the stunning beech forest, which is peppered with native exotics like ponga, toi (mountain cabbage tree) and fuscia. Beautiful to see, sweet to smell. After two hours the riders reached the banks of Miniha Stream, a tributary to the Whakatane River, where the arrival of the BMW F 850 GS motorcycles startled a family of Kuni Kuni pigs grazing on the grasses. When the engines quietened the riders could appreciate the sounds of the forest: cicada buzzing their incessant ‘zid-zid’ while bell birds, tui and fantails added their myriad song. It was here the riders faced their first test in the 2020 Int. GS Trophy – River Crossing. For each team the three riders needed to ride a trials course that crossed and recrossed the stream before exiting up a steep bank – all three needing to complete the course before a four minute cutoff. The stones and boulders rattled the GS bikes as well as the nerves of the riders, particularly as footing and falls attracted additional penalties – a daunting prospect on this opening day. Falls did indeed come, but so did some spectacular rides, the French notably smooth, fast and efficient.After the River Crossing the riders regained the gravel tracks, working their way up to the beautiful Lake Waikaremoana and the impressive Mokau waterfall. Here the GS Trophy riders faced the second test of the day, ‘Sena Challenge’ were one rider was effectively blindfolded and would be guided by instructions from his teammate – via his Sena 50R mesh intercom bluetooth headset – around a slalom course. A simple act of faith, and a fun test, but it also highlighted the benefits the riders have been enjoying for the first time in the GS Trophy of being able to communicate in real time with their marshals and each other. The course changed in character immediately after Lake Waikearemoana as the forest gave way to the high country grazing lands that eventually lead down to Hawke’s Bay. This region is typified by steep valleys, high cliffs and tenacious sheep! Riding both highway and gravel this made for a most sinuous trail that allowed the riders to enjoy the F 850 GS’s agility and punchy 95 horsepower. The finish came at a camp ground just outside the seaport of Napier, a beautiful city famed for its Art Deco buildings – those buildings being so prominent on account this city was levelled and rebuilt after an earthquake in 1931. The riders could have been mistaken for having survived a seismic event of their own such was their powder-white appearance after enduring Metzeler-created dust trails for most of the day!. Quotes: Nikki van der Spek, International Female Team 1: “It’s been a lot of fun today. The country is amazing, it is so beautiful and it’s different all the time. The off-road is mostly gravel, not so hard to ride but you have to be careful of the loose gravel. The tarmac is like a race track, corner after corner – a lot of fun! The first test wasn’t easy, my bike fell down and so did that of the second rider so we timed-out. The Sena Challenge revealed that we have a language barrier in our team; we are Dutch, French and Colombian – so three different languages! We’ll have to work on that.” Sunao Ueda, Team Japan: “The route today was very good, beautiful if dusty in the gravel. But a great experience and when our marshal took us to the highest point in the ranges the view was huge – magnificent! The tests were good, too, although I laid my bike down in the stream, so not so good for us. What I really enjoyed with the company of Team Italy. With the Sena intercoms we were talking – and laughing – all the way, this is a very nice feature of this GS Trophy.” BMW Motorrad International GS Trophy 2020 Oceania.

The BMW Group is expanding production capacity and increasing its staff at the Competence Centre for E-Drive Production in Dingolfing faster than originally planned. Due to growing demand for electrified vehicles, the plant expects the number of modules needed for production of high-voltage batteries to double from the previous year. The number of electric motors required will also increase significantly.Michael Nikolaides, head of Production Engines and E-Drives at the BMW Group: “We are embarking on a massive expansion of our Competence Centre for E-Drive Production in Dingolfing: from 8,000 square metres currently to 80,000 in the future. This is where we produce powertrain components for our fully and partially electric models. By the end of the year, we will increase our staff in this area from 600 to more than 1,400.” Up to 2,000 employees will work on electric motors, battery modules and high-voltage batteries in Dingolfing in the medium term.Christoph Schröder, head of BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, adds: “Thanks to close cooperation between vehicle and component development, our Dingolfing site is now leading the transformation of the automotive industry. More than one in five BMW 5 Series Sedans built at our Dingolfing vehicle plant today is already a plug-in hybrid. We deliver premium e-mobility from Lower Bavaria to customers all over the world.”800 new jobs in electric component production – specialists neededFor the upcoming ramp-up and planned volume growth, qualified staff are currently being recruited on a large scale – both internally at the BMW Group’s plant locations and outside the company. As Nikolaides points out: “We are also combing the market for specialists for the future technology of e-mobility.”Broad electrified vehicle line-up creates stronger demand for electric powertrain componentsThe introduction of the new BMW 330e*, BMW X5 xDrive45e* and BMW X3 xDrive30e* plug-in hybrids, together with the pure electric MINI Cooper SE*, brings the number of electrified vehicles in the BMW Group line-up to 12. These will be joined in 2020 by additional electrified models, such as the BMW X1 plug-in hybrid and the fully-electric BMW iX3.The BMW Group plans to expand its range of electrified vehicles to 25 models by 2023 – more than half of them fully electric. A quarter of the BMW Group vehicles sold in Europe are likely to be electrified by 2021; this percentage will reach a third in 2025 and half in 2030.As a result, the company has a correspondingly high demand for electric motors and batteries. BMW Group Plant Dingolfing plays a pivotal role in supplying other sites with these electric powertrain components. “We don’t just supply the vehicle plant here in Dingolfing; we also delivery batteries and electric motors to most of our automotive plants worldwide,” says Nikolaides.Preparations for production of fifth-generation electric powertrain components well underwayThe site in Lower Bavaria has years of expertise in building components for electric vehicles. Series-produced batteries for the BMW i3 have being coming off the line here since 2013. Since then, products and processes have been continuously optimised.Preparations are already underway for production of the fifth generation of electric motors and batteries. Production is slated to start later this year and will set new standards for scalability and performance capabilities.Important infrastructure decisions are also being made in parallel. In the areas around Dingolfing, the search is underway for a site to locate a new supply centre for the Competence Centre for E-Drive Production. This would be built over the next few years and serve as a “logistics platform” for the competence centre once it reaches its full capacity.\n"}

Two additional first-rate jazz ensembles will present their musical skills at BMW Welt and interpret this year’s theme “The Melody at Night”. The third and fourth concert of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 featuring the Polish ensemble Adam Baldych Quartet and Berlin-based Peter Gall Quintet will be held on February 11 and 18, 2020, respectively. Following two further concerts, the expert jury of BMW Welt Jazz Award will then choose two finalists to compete at the serie’s last concert in May. In addition, the audience will also vote for its favourite ensemble.This year’s edition of the BMW Welt Jazz Award will enter its third round on February 11, 2020, featuring the Adam Baldych Quartet. From an early age, Polish violinist Adam Bałdych was a celebrated prodigy in his home country and launched his international career at the tender age of 16. Following his fellowship at the Berklee College of Music, Baldych was signed by Siggi Loch’s ACT label in 2011. Only two years later, he was awarded the Echo Jazz and has since won numerous other awards including the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. Today, Baldych is celebrated by critics for his supreme technique, which helped “redefine the sound of violins”, and his unparalleled dynamic and powerful use of his instrument. He has worked with international stars such as Yaron Herman, STian Carstensen, Iiro Rantala and Helge Lien and written music for both theater and film. With his current project, “Sacrum Profanum”, Baldych returns to his classical roots – together with his Polish colleagues, pianist Krzysztof Dys, bassist Michal Baranski and drummer Dawid Fortuna, he focusses on “sacral music” and its great composers, from medieval mystic Hildegard von Bingen and Renaissance composer Thomas Tallis to contemporary Russian avant-garde musician Sofia Gubaidukina.Only one week later, on February 18, 2020, the Peter Gall Quintet will put their musical skills to the test at the double-coned structure of BMW Welt. Born in Bad Aibling and based in Berlin, Peter Gall is one of Germany’s most prominent drummers and composers. He has been performing together with his brother, pianist Chris Gall, and alongside jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel as well as numerous other musicians, mostly singers, including Thomas Quasthoff, Jane Monheit, Kim Sanders, Jasmin Tabatabai, Peter Fessler, Take 6 and the New York Voices. Gall has also continued to maintain his international contacts ever since he studied at the Manhattan School of Music in New York. At this year’s BMW Welt Jazz Award, he will present his first album as a band leader. “Paradox Dreambox” is an impressive kaleidoscope of modern jazz sounds presented in collaboration with outstanding colleagues of the innovative German and European jazz scenes including Echo Jazz laureate and finalist of the very first edition of BMW Welt Jazz Award, saxophonist Wanja Slavin, Dutch guitar icon Reinier Baas, pianist Reiner Böhm, winner of the award Neuer Deutscher Jazzpreis, and up-and-coming bassist Felix Henkelhausen.Programme of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020Concerts from 7 pm to about 9.30 pm at the double-coned structure of the BMW Welt:January 14, 2020 Cecilie Grundt QuintetJanuary 21, 2020 Andrea Hermenau QuintetFebruary 11, 2020 Adam Bałdych QuartetFebruary 18, 2020 Peter Gall QuintetFebruary 25, 2020 Reis\/Demuth\/WiltgenMarch 10, 2020 Giovanni Guidi QuintetThe concerts are offered free of charge; however, seating is limited and cannot be guaranteed.

The BMW Group is long-term Corporate Partner of the 11th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art.The members of this intergenerational, female identified team of South American curators envision the forthcoming edition of the Berlin Biennale as a series of lived experiences that evolve as a process. It begins with three sequential moments, exp. 1, exp. 2, and exp. 3 (experiences), unfolding from September 2019 to May 2020, which attempt to learn from and build sustainable relations, not only with participating artists and projects but as importantly, with the city and people of Berlin. The program includes exhibitions, performances, artist residencies, lectures, presentations, and workshops. In summer 2020, the upcoming edition of the Berlin Biennale will bring forth all experiences at four venues.Dates:Epilogue – 11th Berlin Biennale: 13.6.–13.9.2020Public opening: Friday, 12.6.2020, 7 pmFirst exhibition day: Saturday, 13.6.2020, 10 am–7 pm Press conference: Thursday, 11.6.2020Press preview: Thursday, 11.6.2020, 10 am–6 pm Friday, 12.6.2020, 10 am–6 pmProfessional preview: Friday, 12.6.2020, 10 am–6 pmVenues:11th Berlin Biennale c\/o ExRotaprintBornemannstraße 9, 13357 BerlinThe 11th Berlin Biennale space at ExRotaprint—a tenant-run project initiated by artists, bringing together work, art, and community—has been a space for the 11th Berlin Biennale’s diverse experiences since September 2019. ExRotaprint is a model for urban development that rules out financial profit through ownership and establishes a heterogeneous, open environment for all parts of the community. The former site of the Rotaprint AG printing press manufacturing plant with its buildings dating from the 1950s is located in Berlin’s Wedding neighborhood. In 2004 visual artists Daniela Brahm and Les Schliesser formulated a concept for on-site tenants to take over the property. The goal was to develop the location to serve a heterogeneous mix of uses for “Arbeit, Kunst, Soziales” [work, art, community] and to achieve affordable rent for all. Since 2007, the tenant founded, non-profit ExRotaprint gGmbH has been dedicated to the restoration and development of the 10,000-square-meter property. Today, ExRotaprint hosts over one hundred social initiatives, businesses, and spaces for independent artists and others working in the creative sector.daadgalerieOranienstraße 161, 10969 BerlinIn 1965, with the help of the former West Berlin Senate, the DAAD [German Academic Exchange Service] took over the “artists-in-residence program” initiated two years earlier by the Ford Foundation. Under the new title “Berliner Künstlerprogramm des DAAD” [DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program], it became a renowned support program for international artists, writers, and musicians, and later also for filmmakers. In 1978, the daadgalerie opened as a new exhibition venue in former West Berlin. The location was intended to bring together the diverse activities of the artists’ program and offer international guests a platform within the West German cultural scene. Since 2017, the daadgalerie has been located at Oranienstraße 161 in Kreuzberg in “Haus Stiller.” The residential and commercial building was designed in 1910 by the Jewish-Hungarian architect Oskar Kaufmann. Interdisciplinary exhibitions and events by current and former guests of the program are shown on two floors. A dialogue with the local art scene and other institutions in the city is the primary focus.Gropius BauNiederkirchnerstraße 7, 10963 BerlinIn 1881, the Gropius Bau opened as a museum and school of decorative arts. In view of its eventful history and the variety of institutions that have been active here over the years, the Gropius Bau is organized as an open framework for addressing a broad variety of artistic practices and modes of thinking. Since Stephanie Rosenthal took over as director in 2018, the program has focused on opening up the institution as a location for artistic creation and exchange. The active collaboration with contemporary artists aims at revealing creative processes, presenting new perspectives, and reflecting the possibilities of the institution. A central reference point for the program is also the nuanced examination of the building’s geographical location, history, and present-day status, including questions of land, borders, trauma, care, and repair.KW Institute for Contemporary ArtAuguststraße 69, 10117 BerlinSince its inception in the early 1990s, KW Institute for Contemporary Art has devoted itself to the central questions of our times through the production, presentation, and dissemination of contemporary art. The Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art, which was launched soon after, emerged from a pressing desire for an extensive dialogue with the international discourse around contemporary art. In addition to other venues across the city, the Berlin Biennale has regularly used KW’s exhibition spaces since 1998. Numerous outstanding artists and internationally renowned curators have since realized important new works and exhibition projects there, establishing the two institutions located under the roof of KUNST-WERKE BERLIN e. V. as vibrant venues for progressive artistic practices, both within the Berlin art scene and internationally.More information and a selection of images are available via the website and upon request: 11.berlinbiennale.de\/press\/The Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art is funded by the Kulturstiftung des Bundes (German Federal Cultural Foundation) and organized by KUNST-WERKE BERLIN e. V. The 11th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art is supported by the Senate Department for Culture and Europe.Besides the Berlin Biennale, the list of long-term commitments of the BMW Group to the arts in Germany’s capital city includes the Gallery Weekend and the Preis der Nationalgalerie. Beyond the extensive commitment to the arts, BMW cooperates with the opera house Staatsoper Unter den Linden and invites to the long-standing open-air format “State Opera for All” at Bebelplatz. With BWM OPERA NEXT, the partnership was extended in 2018 and makes use of the opportunities of digitalization to open fresh perspectives and new ways accessing the world of opera for young audiences.\n"}

The test and development phase for the BMW M2 CS Racing is entering the home stretch. Now the time has come to present the new entry-level car in the BMW M Customer Racing product range to the public, and to potential customers. Last weekend, the BMW M2 CS Racing celebrated its North American debut at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA). The intention is for the car to continue the success story started by the BMW M235i Racing and the BMW M240i Racing in recent years.Fans were able to steal a first glance at the newest member of the family at the first highlight of the new season, where three different BMW racing cars were in action – the winning BMW M8 GTE and the BMW M6 GT3 in the 24-hour race, and the BMW M4 GT4 in the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge race. The BMW M2 CS Racing was on display in the event area near the BMW M Experience truck, where anyone could come along to take a look.BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt said: “BMW racing cars have enjoyed regular success in North America since the 1970s and they really thrill the fans. That applies to our GT cars and to the BMW M2 CS Racing’s predecessors that helped BMW customer teams to secure countless wins and titles over the years. From the 2021 season onwards, we are aiming to add a new chapter to our history of success in North American motorsport with the BMW M2 CS Racing.”From the start of the 2020 season, responsibility for the sale and distribution of BMW race cars for customer racing lies with BMW M GmbH. Their Head of Sales and Marketing, Thomas Felbermair, said: “North America is the most important market for BMW M worldwide, therefore it is important for us to present the BMW M2 CS Racing as our new entry-level car for the first time in the US. With this car we will not only be represented in classic motor racing, but also in the club racing segment and in the Track Day community. We have many loyal fans and customers in North America, who all share an emotional connection to our brand. Consequently, we see plenty of potential for our new car in North America. We are looking forward to giving our fans, customers and BMW dealers a close look at the BMW M2 CS Racing at various events during the next few weeks. I am sure that they will love it.”After appearing at Daytona, the BMW M2 CS Racing was presented to North American BMW dealers during a conference outside Miami (USA). In early March, the car will be shown at the TC America season-opener at Austin (USA), where it will be sent into race competition by customer teams from the 2021 season onwards.BMW M2 CS Racing to continue the success story in North America.The BMW M2 CS Racing can build on the extremely successful history of its predecessors in North America. Since 2016, BMW customer teams have claimed three team titles and two drivers’ championships with the BMW M235i Racing and the BMW M240i Racing in TC America and the previous series. The aim is for the new car to continue in this vein.The BMW M2 CS Racing offers the best setup for successful entry into motorsport. The new customer racing car is powered by an S55 six-cylinder in-line engine with BMW M TwinPower Turbo Technology which, with a capacity of 2,979 cc in the racing version, achieves between 280 hp , depending on the Balance of Performance or Permit B classification. The maximum torque of 550 Nm is transmitted by a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission which has been applied using specialist motorsport software. Another highlight of the BMW M2 CS Racing is its engine management. As with the BMW M4 GT4, in the future this will be controlled via power sticks, which enable various performance levels to be programmed and retrieved depending on the stipulated Balance of Performance.In parallel, BMW Motorsport is developing an upgrade variant of the BMW M2 CS Racing with 450 hp, providing a compelling racing car for the club racing segment that is rapidly gaining in popularity in North America.\n"}

Maximilian Günther (GER) earned his place in the history books in the ABB FIA Formula E Championship with victory at the Santiago E-Prix (CHI). In an interview, the youngest Formula E winner ever discusses the eventful race, his mental strength, the reasons behind the strong start to the season for the BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team, and his goals for the season and the coming years. Maximilian, how many messages did you receive in the first few days after your win in Santiago? Maximilian Günther: “A heck of a lot. It took a few days to get around to answering them all.” Now you’ve had time to reflect, how do you rate your success? Günther: “I am still absolutely delighted, particularly as I enjoy watching the footage of the race and reliving the emotions time and again. As I said straight after the race, the victory was a dream come true for me. What we achieved as a team in Santiago means an awful lot to me. One year ago, I had to take a break from my Formula E career after the race in Santiago. To now win, twelve months later, at the same venue, shows that I was right to keep believing in myself, working hard, and sticking to my guns.” What does it mean to you to be the youngest winner in the history of Formula E? Günther: “It is definitely cool to see my name on the top of this record list, although it goes without saying that the win, the 25 points and the trophy, with which I associate all those fantastic emotions, are more important to me. Let’s see how long I hold that record for.” After the extremely exciting closing stages of the race, BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt praised the way you drove so “maturely and calmly”. How were the final laps in the cockpit for you? Günther: “The last ten laps were very intense, for several reasons. You had the heat, which meant we had to be very careful about energy management and the temperature of the batteries. The amount of race time remaining meant that, for a long time, it was uncertain whether or not we would have to drive another lap. As such, we were on the radio a lot discussing the strategy. Then António Félix da Costa came storming up behind me, because he and his team had apparently banked on not having to do an extra lap. When he passed me with an aggressive manoeuvre, I stayed calm and concentrated on how I could still win the race, as it was clear to me that the issue of temperature was more critical for António than it was for me. I did not give up, stayed with him and, fortunately, was able to counter decisively on the final lap.” Is the ability to stay calm one of your biggest strengths? Günther: “I believe I am very good at doing my own thing and focussing on myself. That certainly helped me in such a complicated and hectic race. However, that does not only go for me personally. As an entire team, we focussed solely on getting the best out of the race situation for us. That worked out superbly.” In your opinion, what was the key to your win? Günther: “There were several factors. Firstly, the timing of our second ATTACK MODE was perfect. I was able to overtake both Pascal Wehrlein and Mitch Evans and take the lead. That gave me two crucial advantages. I had a clear track ahead of me, which meant the batteries were cooled better, and I was able to drive a little more economically and thus go easy on the battery for a few laps. That paid dividends in the closing stages. Then there was the outstanding communication with my race engineer. I am very happy that we understand each other so well, even after the short time I have been in the team. We have both worked very hard on that in recent months. We trust each other implicitly.” Generally speaking, how happy do you feel in the BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team? Günther: “Right from the first test, I have felt extremely happy in the team and have settled in very quickly. From the word go, I felt my biggest task was, as quickly as possible, to get on so well with every member of the team that we are able to work together at the highest possible level. We are making good progress in that regard, but there is definitely still room for improvement. After all, that was only my third race for the team. It is obviously great to be rewarded so early for the hard work with a win.” How would you explain the impressive start to the season for BMW i Andretti Motorsport? Günther: “Several factors play a part. For one thing, BMW i Motorsport and the Andretti team complement each other very well. Everyone contributes as well as possible with their own particular strengths. Then, the experience that the team gained as a works outfit in Season 5 certainly also plays a role. Furthermore, the guys in Munich are doing a mega job developing the drivetrain. Alexander Sims and I also have a great relationship and are very open with each other when it comes to sharing our experiences. All the jigsaw pieces are coming together very nicely at the moment.” What are your goals for the rest of the season? Günther: “My goal for this season is to continue on the path we have embarked on. We must focus on ourselves, do our homework, and thus improve continuously over the course of the season. We must wait and see what that brings us come the end of the season. In the medium and long term, my goal is to win the title in Formula E. That does not have to be this season but, generally speaking, that is what I aspire to.”\n"}

BMW Group India presents the 1979 Art Car painted by most renowned American artist Andy Warhol in India. His creation will be exclusively exhibited from 31 January - 2 February 2020 at the India Art Fair in New Delhi. After Alexander Calder, Frank Stella and Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol created the 4th Art Car for BMW with the BMW M1Group 4 to compete at the infamous 24 hour race of Le Mans. BMW Art Cars or the ‘Rolling Sculptures’ are original masterpieces of art that demonstrate an individual synthesis of artistic expression and automobile design. Since 1975, 19 international artists have created Art Cars based on contemporary BMW automobiles of their times, all offering a wide range of artistic interpretations.Mr. Rudratej Singh, President and Chief Executive Officer, BMW Group India said, “At BMW, we just don’t build the best performing cars, but deeply believe in the intangibles. We hold our design aesthetics very dear, this inspires us as well as our users to stretch their creative boundaries. People love BMW for its superior performance, safety, luxurious experiences, and an underpinning is the design and aesthetic creative sensibility. To help build and strengthen intercultural platforms of creativity in the field of art, music, design and architecture is therefore very core to us. India Art Fair is a perfect platform for us to reach out to our discerning customers and showcase the brands aesthetics and design philosophy. My personal favourite is the exclusive showcase of the most photographed BMW Art Car in the world - by Andy Warhol. It is at India Art Fair and I would urge our fans and patrons not to miss seeing it in person! We bring to India yet another timeless interaction between art, artist and the automobile closer to our customers and connoisseurs of art.”#4 BMW Art Car Andy Warhol 1979 BMW M1 Group 4“I love this car. It’s more successful than the artwork,” was the opinion of Andy Warhol after his sweeping brush strokes had transformed the BMW M1. It took him less than half an hour to create the fourth exhibit in the BMW Art Car Collection. 40 years later, enthusiasm for the mid-engined sports car remains unabated. Already world-famous at that time, the US icon of Pop Art shared the same passion with many automobile fans of that bygone era. And the fascination of the unique special created by Warhol has indeed increased. Many fans regard his Art Car as the highlight of the entire collection.A person who declares soup cans a work of art or aspires to have a department store closed so that it may be preserved as a museum for posterity, will not see any conflict between technology and creativity. Consequently, this is how he worked. Instead of first designing a scale model and leaving the final completion to his assistants as his predecessors did, the pop art legend painted the BMW M1 from the beginning to the end himself. “I have tried to give a vivid depiction of speed. If a car is really fast, all contours and colours will become blurred”.Andy WarholThe name Andy Warhol is the quintessence of pop art. Born in Pittsburgh USA in 1928, he studied from 1945 to 1949 at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He began his artistic career as a commercial artist and was successful in holding his own exhibition in New York as early as in 1952. In 1956 his work was acknowledged with the coveted “Art Director’s Club Award“. 1962 saw the creation of the legendary “Factory” – a negation and reversal of traditional artistic ideas as it had never been seen before. His celebrity portraits and paintings of trivial objects became famous. Warhol died in New York in 1987.BMW Art Car CollectionFor over 40 years, BMW Art Car Collection has fascinated art and design enthusiasts as well as lovers of cars and technology with its unique combination of fine art and innovative automobile technology. Several cars from BMW Art Car Collection are usually on display at the BMW Museum in Munich, the home of BMW Art Cars, as part of its permanent collection. The remaining BMW Art Cars travel the globe – to art fairs as well as exhibitions.The BMW Art Car collection was born when French race car driver and art aficionado Hervé Poulain, together with Jochen Neerpasch, then BMW Motorsport Director, asked his artist friend Alexander Calder to design an automobile. The result was a BMW 3.0 CSL, which competed in 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1975, where it quickly became the crowd’s favourite. Since then, 19 international artists have designed BMW models, among them some of the most renowned artists of our time: Alexander Calder (BMW 3.0 CSL, 1975), Frank Stella (BMW 3.0 CSL, 1976), Roy Lichtenstein (BMW 320 Group 5, 1977), Andy Warhol (BMW M1 Group 4, 1979), Ernst Fuchs (BMW 635CSi, 1982), Robert Rauschenberg (BMW 635CSi, 1986), Michael Jagamara Nelson (BMW M3 Group A, 1989), Ken Done (BMW M3 Group A, 1989), Matazo Kayama (BMW 535i, 1990), César Manrique (BMW 730i, 1990), A. R. Penck (BMW Z1, 1991), Esther Mahlangu (BMW 525i, 1991), Sandro Chia (BMW M3 GTR, 1992), David Hockney (BMW 850CSi, 1995), Jenny Holzer (BMW V12 LMR, 1999), Ólafur Eliasson (BMW H2R, 2007), Jeff Koons (BMW M3 GT2, 2010), John Baldessari (BMW M6 GT3) and Cai Fei (BMW M6 GT3).The BMW Art Car Collection is by no means complete as it stands. The number of exhibits will continue to grow, adding artistic expressions to the collection.About BMW’s Cultural CommitmentSince its inception, BMW Group India has participated in leading cultural engagements across the country. In 2007, two BMW Art Cars embellished by world renowned artists Andy Warhol (BMW M1, 1979) and Roy Lichtenstein (BMW 320i, 1977) were presented at the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai. BMW Art Car by Jeff Koons, Sandro Chia and Cesar Manrique have been exclusively showcased at India Art Fair. Since 2012, BMW has partnered with Kochi-Muziris Biennale, the contemporary art fair, which brings international artists to India and creates a global platform for Indian artists. In 2012-13, the innovative BMW Guggenheim Lab came to India. Based at Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum and conducted at six different sites in Mumbai, the lab organised six weeks of free program with diverse audience and communities addressing the challenges and conditions of the urban city.For almost 50 years now, the BMW Group has initiated and engaged in over 100 cultural cooperation’s worldwide. The company places the main focus of its long-term commitment on contemporary and modern art, classical music and jazz as well as architecture and design. In 1972, three large-scale paintings were created by the artist Gerhard Richter specifically for the foyer of the BMW Group's Munich headquarters. Since then, artists such as Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Daniel Barenboim, Jonas Kaufmann and architect Zaha Hadid have co-operated with BMW. In 2016 and 2017, female artist Cao Fei from China and American John Baldessari created the next two vehicles for the BMW Art Car Collection. Besides co-initiatives, such as BMW Tate Live, the BMW Art Journey and the ‘Opera for All’ concerts in Berlin, Munich, Moscow and London, the company also partners with leading museums and art fairs as well as orchestras and opera houses around the world. The BMW Group gives absolute creative freedom in all its cultural activities – as this initiative is as essential for producing groundbreaking artistic work as it is for major innovations in a successful business.\n"}
{"prompt":"Spectacular light installation in Lisbon, the “Green Capital of Europe 2020”, demonstrates the progress made in expanding the public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles – searchlights installed at charging stations illuminate the sky above the city – action in the Portuguese metropolis is part of the campaign to place the market launch of the all-electric MINI Cooper SE in the limelight.  ->","completion":" Munich\/Lisbon. Electromobility is conquering city traffic. And the new MINI Cooper SE will finally allow the driving fun so typical of the brand to be experienced with local zero-emission mobility in urban environments. MINI ELECTRIC is raising the profile of sustainable mobility at the market launch for the all-electric model of the British premium brand in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. The charisma emanating from electric mobility is being symbolised in a very special way using powerful searchlights connected to public charging stations in the city as their impressive cones of light are directed into the night sky. The light show is projecting a very clear message: There’s no shortage of charging points. MINI ELECTRIC is showing the route to them and highlighting their availability: The ideal time has now come to transfer to local emission-free mobility.The location for the spectacular show put on by MINI ELECTRIC was selected with care. The European Commission has selected Lisbon as the “Green Capital of Europe 2020”. The metropolis on the Atlantic coast has qualified for the award with a large number of initiatives on improving environmental conditions and the quality of life in the city. A total of more than 500 public charging points gives Lisbon one of the world’s densest networks for supplying electricity to electric vehicles. And the city authority is becoming increasingly committed to local emission-free mobility. 39 percent of the municipal fleet is already made up of electric vehicles.The event is being staged by MINI ELECTRIC in cooperation with Lisbon’s city authority and it is concentrated on the inner city and three urban districts along the Atlantic coast. It quite literally highlights the sheer density of the network of charging points and thereby demonstrates the excellent conditions for electric driving. The light cones projected into the sky by the searchlights signal that drivers of electrically powered automobiles are able to charge the high-voltage battery installed in their vehicle at virtually every street corner. The light show was designed in close collaboration with the Portuguese air-safety authorities so as to exclude any impacts on air traffic.Lisbon is being transformed into a beacon for many cities where significant progress has recently been achieved in the expansion of the charging infrastructure. Across Europe there is now a network of more than 170 000 public charging points for electric vehicles. Parallel development is seeing battery-cell technology achieving a steady increase in range. As a consequence, the new MINI Cooper SE benefits from specific technology designed into the model in the form of a high-voltage battery located low in the floor of the vehicle and configured to deliver a range of between 235 and 270 kilometres. The car offers exactly the same space for passengers and baggage as the conventionally powered MINI 3-door automobile.Meanwhile, the driving fun offered in the new MINI Cooper SE is absolutely unique, delivered by an electric motor packing 135 kW\/184 hp and generating spontaneous development of power. It can accelerate from zero to 60 km\/h in 3.9 seconds and sprints to 100 km\/h in just 7.3 seconds. And there’s no delay when the high-voltage battery is being charged up. The charger for the new MINI Cooper SE allows direct-current quick-charging stations to be used along with a refresher of the energy reserves with power of up to 50 kW. This means that the high-voltage battery can be charged to 80 percent of total capacity within just 35 minutes.\n"}

The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has continued its preparations for the 2020 season of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) with a double test. Last week, the team and its riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Eugene Laverty (IRL) spent two days testing in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. This was followed on Sunday and Monday by a further two days of testing in Portimão (POR). The team used the tests to work through a comprehensive programme with the BMW S 1000 RR. Both riders had two bikes at their disposal. This allowed Sykes, Laverty and their respective crews to evaluate more new components and many different set-up configurations, in order to establish the best possible basis set-up in time for the start of the season. While it rained repeatedly on both days in Spain, conditions were dry and sunny at times in Portugal. The two riders used the time between the two tests in Jerez de la Frontera and Portimão for another important part of pre-season preparations: fitness training. Sykes and Laverty trained together at times. The final phase of preparations now begin at the team headquarters in Guisborough (GBR) and at BMW Motorrad Motorsport in Munich (GER). The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team heads to Philipp Island (AUS) for a further two days of testing on 24th and 25th February, before the new season of WorldSBK gets underway at the same venue from 28th February to 1st March. Quotes after the tests at Jerez de la Frontera and Portimão. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “On the whole, we are happy with both tests, as we were able to work through an extensive programme with both riders. We travelled with some new parts for the RR, including new wheels, and we made also more steps forward in terms of electronic strategies and their detailed set-up both in Jerez and Portimão. Over the course of the four days, we were able to sort out some important issues on both sides of the garage, and to gain a lot of information and data. We now have an even clearer idea of what direction we need to head in on Phillip Island. We also have reinforced the team in the form of new members, and the double test was the perfect way to fully integrate them in our team. We will now continue to work hard, to ensure we are as well prepared as possible when we travel to Australia.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was very productive days in Spain and Portugal with a very successful finish at Portimão. Good weather greeted us here and that also allowed us to go through the items we could not do in Jerez due to rain. We’ve made big steps with the elcetronics with both riders benefitting from it. Eugene overall got a lot of confidence now going to Australia, Tom tried some settings he was not used to evaluate them and to to find an even better direction for him. Both riders and the team took the decision not to put any special development or qualifying tyres on, so the times that we have got have been on the normal race tyre. Overall, both riders are very satisfied with the work we have conducted, we gathered a lot of valuable data and have a good base to move into Australia. So it was a positive test and we can’t wait to go to Australia.” Tom Sykes: “I’m very happy with the two tests. Jerez obviously was very challenging from the weather front but we were able to utilise that and do some little fundamental things. It then was much more consistent here in Portugal and we were just able to do a lot of work with our BMW S 1000 RR. We just had to turn a bit of a blind eye to what was going on on track and focus on what we are doing. We worked really hard on different chassis set-ups, on the brakes, electronic strategies... and the list goes on. A big credit to the entire BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, the boys have worked really, really hard over these days. Now it’s time to go back home and get everything ready for Phillip Island and where we can focus more on performance.” Eugene Laverty: “I am really delighted and optimistic. The November test was a bit of a tough one as I got a few surprises when I rode the RR for the first time. The work that the guys did is incredible. That’s the nice thing of being involved with a factory team again: the progress is so quick and these guys are so intelligent. I give my comments but in the end my comments are only backing up what they already know. These guys understand very well how to make the bike work. The focus in Spain had been power delivery and traction control and when we arrived at Portimão, we started to play around with the chassis setting. And the performance in the end was really good. So after these tests, I’m very happy, we’re in a good position.” \n"}

BMW Team RLL won the opening round of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Daytona (USA) for the second season in a row.  ->","completion":" John Edwards (USA), Jesse Krohn (FIN), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Chaz Mostert (AUS) took victory in the GTLM class at the wheel of the #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE at ‘Daytona International Speedway’. The #25 car finished fifth. At the head of the field, the BMW works drivers thrilled GT fans with magnificent overtaking manoeuvres to finish ahead of two Porsche cars in second and third place.BMW Team RLL tasted victory at Daytona in 2019. Back then, Farfus gave an impressive final stint to clinch first place at the Florida endurance classic. This time, it was Krohn who took the wheel for the last stint of the race. He overtook the leading #911 Porsche with 46 minutes of the race remaining. Shortly thereafter, he came in for his final pit stop, following which he successfully defended his lead to the finish. Krohn also set the fastest lap of the race with a time of 1:42.168 minutes.This latest triumph sees BMW Motorsport add another chapter to its success story at Daytona where BMW first won at the ‘World Center of Racing’ back in 1976 with the BMW 3.0 CSL. The BMW M3 GTR then took class wins in 1997 and 1998. Daytona prototypes with BMW engines crossed the finish line in first place in 2011 and 2013. This was the fourth GTLM victory in the IMSA series for the BMW M8 GTE. Connor De Phillippi (USA), Bruno Spengler (CAN), Philipp Eng (AUT) and Colton Herta (USA), who alternated at the wheel of the #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, were unfortunate. Their car ran over debris which damaged an oil line in the early stages of the race. That necessitated a long stop for repairs which saw the quartet drop well down the field. As a result, fifth place was the best the #25 car could achieve.In the GTD class, the Turner Motorsport team was challenging for a top result at the season-opener in the #96 BMW M6 GT3. BMW works driver Jens Klingmann (GER), Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley and Dillon Machavern (all USA) finished sixth after 763 laps. For Dan Harper (GBR), Neil Verhagen (USA) and Max Hesse (GER) – the members of the new BMW Junior Team – the victory for the BMW M8 GTE was the icing on the cake at the end of an eventful weekend. The three Juniors were involved in the processes within BMW Team RLL and gained valuable experience behind the scenes. This included a visit to Radio Le Mans, as well as the honour of waving the start flag for the BMW Endurance Challenge, Friday’s opening round of this season’s IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge.The next round of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship takes place on 21stMarch 2020 at Sebring (USA).Reactions to the 24 Hours of Daytona.Klaus Fröhlich (Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development): “That was an extremely exciting race. The final hours were particularly tense, with the lead changing hands many times. Today’s victory for BMW Team RLL at the Daytona 24-hour race ranks very highly in many regards. It was the result of excellent teamwork between the team, drivers and our engineers. The operative excellence of BMW Team RLL was remarkable. 24 hours without a single mistake, under great pressure throughout the entire race. Compliments to everyone. The same goes for our quartet of drivers, who gave a perfect performance. Last but not least, our BMW M8 GTE once again demonstrated its winning genes at the scene of last year’s triumph. In doing so, it underlined the fact that this car is one of the top GT cars out there right now. The BMW M8 GTE showed no signs of weakness in this 24-hour sprint. It was among the leaders all race and led for more kilometres than anyone else. And all that against extremely strong opposition. We certainly put on a display of great motor racing for the fans and spectators. That was a strong start to the year for BMW Motorsport, including in other categories. Congratulations to all involved. Long may it continue.”Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“Two Daytona wins in a row for the BMW M8 GTE. That is a sensational effort from BMW Team RLL, the drivers and our engineers at BMW Motorsport in Munich. It is hard to compare the two triumphs. In 2019, we only led for one lap and took advantage of our late opportunity to take victory in the rain. This year, we were among the front-runners from the opening lap. We led for longer than any other GTLM car. The race was defined by the fantastic battle between our #24 car and the two Porsches. We witnessed hard but fair racing. That is how it should be. Congratulations to John Edwards, Jesse Krohn, Chaz Mostert and Augusto Farfus on their victory, as well as the entire team in the background. Had the #25 car not needed to come in early for repairs after debris from another car damaged an oil line, then Connor De Phillippi, Bruno Spengler, Colton Herta and Philipp Eng would definitely have been good for a top result too. We certainly head into the rest of the IMSA season with plenty of momentum now.”Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “Whoever thought we were just lucky to win last year were shown otherwise today. That was a battle for 24 hours. The drivers did a fantastic job, and the same goes for the crew. We did not make any mistakes. I feel sorry for the guys in the #25 car, as they would also have finished further up the field without the incident. On the whole, I am delighted for my team and BMW Motorsport. Congratulations to Porsche and Corvette, who were good from the word go with their new cars. We are simply very happy today.”John Edwards (#24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 1stplace): “I am very rarely speechless – but that is the case today. I had every faith in Jesse bringing it home at the end. And he did it. It was a really hard fight, as always in the GTLM class. The many battles were extremely tiring, particularly during my triple stint. This is definitely the biggest success of my career. I’m overjoyed.\"Jesse Krohn (#24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 1stplace):“What a race! It feels absolutely incredible. This is my third year in the GTLM class – and my first victory. We have come so close so often, and now we have actually done it here at Daytona. The team was awesome. Thank you very much to BMW Motorsport and RLL for trusting me to take the final stint of the race. Every single person did a mega job. I cannot believe that we are on the very top step of the podium.”Augusto Farfus (#24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 1stplace): “I am speechless. That was the best 24-hour race I have driven in my whole life. It was extremely fast, extremely close, and you could not afford to make any mistakes. We drove a perfect race: team, strategy, drivers, mechanics. The car worked well throughout the entire race. You don’t get through the full 24 hours like that very often. To win this race twice in a row is exceptional.”Chaz Mostert (#24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 1stplace): “Incredible! This is my biggest win since Bathurst 2014. My world-class team-mates carried me through this race. Thank you very much to BMW Motorsport and RLL for allowing me to be involved. In 2019, the other car won. Back then, I could not imagine how it must feel for those guys. Now it was me stood on the top step of the podium. That is something very special.”Connor De Phillippi (#25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 5thplace):“Two wins in a row, that is fantastic for the team. I may not have won the race, but I am still delighted for the guys. John and Jesse were often unlucky in recent years, which makes it all the nicer that they won today. It is obviously also great for Chaz and Augusto. Personally, I would have liked a better result. However, we win and lose as a team. Today, we won together. Now it is time to win at Sebring.”Bruno Spengler (#25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 5thplace):“We were really unlucky in this race. Even early on in the race we were 13 laps off the pace and with no chance of making much progress through the field. However, the car was superb and the whole team did a fantastic job. I am very happy for the crew and my team-mates that we won with the #24 car. The guys deserve that. Congratulations on a great performance.”Philipp Eng (#25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE):“I am overjoyed for the guys in the #24 car. The win is absolutely deserved. I am pleased for all the drivers, who are all great guys. We are good friends. One team, one goal – that’s not just an empty phrase. I am really pleased for them. What happened to our car is a shame. However, these things happen. We’ll go again next time.Colton Herta (#25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE):“I am obviously disappointed for our car, but I am pleased for the team. Everyone was flawless all weekend. We dropped well back early on in the race, but had good pace after that. I am delighted for my team-mates, who really deserved this victory.”\n"}
{"prompt":"Some me-time in the snow, a day in the mountains – for residents living in the city of Munich this is an attractive option. Driving the all-electric model of the British premium brand even allows the short trip to the Alps to be undertaken locally with zero emissions. The range is sufficient to go on a trip to the winter sports region of Sölden in Austria and then come back home, in each case without the need for a stopover to recharge the batteries.  ->","completion":" Munich. The mountain calls – and never more so than in winter. In fact, there is an entire choir of mountain peaks which are attractive for winter sports fans particularly in Munich and the surrounding area. A spontaneous awayday for skiing or sledging is a very appealing option for residents living in the Bavarian capital. After all, even from the inner city, the mountains appear to be enticingly close. Moreover, a day trip to the snow provides the ideal opportunity to try out new terrain for electromobility beyond the city traffic and test the qualities of the new MINI Cooper SE in winter times.There is a big selection of winter sports resorts that are accessible even after a short road trip, but one thing is clear from the outset. The all-electric MINI is ambitious. Sölden, Austria, is entered in the standard navigation system. Thanks to its location at an altitude of some 1 350 metres and two glaciers within the ski area, this resort at the heart of the Tyrolean Ötztal valley has the reputation of already being snow-sure in late autumn. It is a local destination accessible with zero emissions. The distance between BMW Welt in Munich and the valley station of the Gaislachkoglbahn cable car in Sölden is exactly 200 kilometres.The range of the MINI Cooper SE determined in the official test cycle is between 235 and 270 kilometres – values that can also be achieved in practice provided that the entire power of the 135 kW\/184 hp engine is not constantly used. The route from the south of Munich to winter fun initially takes drivers onto motorway 95. Soon the Alpine foothils start to reach for the skies on the right and left of the road. A relaxed journey in GREEN mode activates an accelerator response geared to efficiency and takes the MINI Cooper SE close to the Zugspitze mountain. From Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the road leads in a south-easterly direction towards the border between Germany and Austria at the border town of Mittenwald.Alternatively, the MINI Driving Modes can also yield the GREEN+ setting where the heating is additionally deactivated to reduce electricity consumption and extend the range. However, this is not really necessary. The MINI Electric has been equipped with 2-zone automatic air-conditioning as standard, the interior heating is generated by means of a heat pump which extracts heat dissipated from the motor, drive control and the high-voltage battery, and from external air, and all these heat sources are combined to produce comfortable temperatures. The heating is based on particularly high efficiency and uses up to 75 percent less energy than a conventional electric heating system to provide excellent climate comfort even when operating in winter temperatures. There’s therefore absolutely no reason to already be wearing a ski jacket, hat and gloves during the actual trip. Especially since the boot offers plenty of space to accommodate warm sports clothing alongside ski equipment and a toboggan. Because the model-specific high-voltage battery has been ingeniously located in the central tunnel and configured in the subfloor, the storage volume of between 211 and 731 litres in the boot gives precisely the same space as in conventionally powered versions of the MINI 3-door.On Austrian country roads, the MINI Cooper SE is finally beginning to scent genuine mountain air. An altitude of almost 1 200 metres is reached in the Tyrolean village of Seefeld. There are ideal conditions here for cross-country skiing, but the MINI Cooper SE is in its element on the roads leading up to the pass. Hairpin bends and snow on the road offer generous scope to test the car’s talent for driving fun. Its drive stability control with actuator-operated wheel-slip limiter permit extremely fast and precise responses to changed driving conditions and enhance the agility so typical of the brand to an even higher level.In spite of several enthusiastic sprints, some power-sapping uphill climbs and freezing weather conditions, there are still adequate energy reserves as the car reaches the outskirts of Sölden. This is where the BMW Group’s long track record of experience in the development and production of high-voltage batteries comes into its own. The storage capacity of the cells was further increased with the latest generation of battery technology used in the MINI Cooper SE. The cycle stability was also additionally optimised and this exerts a significant impact on the durability of the high-voltage battery. The warranty, valid for a period of eight years after first registration, was therefore extended to a distance of 160 000 kilometres or 100 000 miles.While the occupants are having a good time on the slopes, the MINI Cooper SE can recharge at a charging point close to the valley station. Charging capacity of 11 kW, similar to that generated at a MINI ELECTRIC Wallbox, is sufficient to fully recharge an empty high-voltage battery with energy in three and a half hours. Furthermore, the battery and charging unit of the MINI Cooper SE are also suitable for rapid charging with direct current up to 50 kW. This allows a complete charge in less than one and a half hours.Timeout in the snow can be longer if desired. The Gaislachkoglbahn cable car takes skiers up to 3 040 metres in two stages. The trip up to the “Ice Q” mountain-top restaurant takes less than a quarter of an hour where the futuristic glass cube provided a film set for the James Bond thriller “Spectre”. Sölden offers ski runs totalling 144 kilometres with varying levels of difficulty and three main peaks over 3 000 metres in height. The highest peak is the Schwarze Schneid at 3 340 metres. Skiers are able to ski down from the summit along a slope 15 kilometres long and experience a difference in altitude of 1 970 metres. And there is a 7.3 kilometre toboggan run from the middle station of the Gaislachkoglbahn down to the valley.Shortly before the last downhill run of the day, it’s time to use the MINI Connected Remote app. The progress of the charging process is not the only parameter that can be monitored remotely. The independent car heater in the MINI Cooper SE can also be activated. When the desired start time is entered on the smartphone, its timer function ensures that the car’s interior is heated up in good time. Nobody needs to shiver behind the steering wheel in damp winter clothing. And the ice scraper is history. The verdict: Perfect for skiing and sledging, ideal for a return trip.There’s certainly no shortage of envious glances through icy windows. In fact, the MINI Cooper SE proves to be a real eyecatcher generally in the Ötztal valley. People ask about the sales launch – from March 2020 – as frequently as they enquire about acceleration – zero to 60 in 3.9 seconds and the sprint from zero to 100 km\/h in 7.3 seconds. It’s certainly no surprise that 100 000 people across the world have already registered an interest in the all-electric model with MINI. The first owners of a MINI Cooper SE will already be able to put the car through its paces as a piste shuttle in the current ski season. After all, there’s generally sufficient snow for a spontaneous winter-sports outing in Sölden up until May.\n"}

Win number two in race three of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E Championship for BMW i Andretti Motorsport: In a thrilling finale, Maximilian Günther (GER) pulled off a final-lap overtaking manoeuvre in the #28 BMW iFE.20 to take victory at the Santiago E-Prix (CHI). The 22-year-old claimed the first win of his Formula E career in only his third race for the team. In doing so, he also became the youngest winner ever in the series. The 25 points scored took BMW i Andretti Motorsport to the top of the Team standings. Alexander Sims (GBR) crashed out in Santiago. In qualifying, Sims struggled with a track that was still slippery for group one. After three pole positions in a row, he was forced to settle for 15th place on the grid. Günther took perfect advantage of the better track conditions in group three and progressed to Super Pole, where second place gave him a start position on the front row of the grid, the fourth consecutive time that a BMW had started from row one. While Sims found himself embroiled in many fierce battles in the midfield at the start of the race, and was ultimately forced to retire after making contact with the crash barriers, Günther established himself nicely in the top three. Towards the end of the race, he benefitted from the energy efficiency of his BMW iFE.20 and the team’s outstanding strategy. In a captivating battle for the lead, he was able to overtake António Félix da Costa (POR) on the final lap and take the chequered flag in first place. Reactions to the Santiago E-Prix: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“That was an extraordinary performance, both from Maximilian Günther and everyone in the BMW i Andretti Motorsport team. It is incredible how maturely and coolly Maximilian drove in only his third Formula E race for our team. He more than deserved the first Formula E win of his career and the title of ‘youngest Formula E winner ever’. He and the team kept a cool head, particularly in the dramatic closing stages, and judged the situation correctly. We reckoned that António could have cooling problems, and that is exactly what happened. That correct appraisal allowed Max to pull off the fantastic overtaking manoeuvre on the final lap. On the whole, we can obviously be extremely happy with two wins and two pole positions in three races, as well as first place in the Team competition. Alexander Sims had a tough day today, but he is still right up there. We now have two winning drivers in the Drivers’ Championship, and we will go on the attack with both of them again at the Mexico City E-Prix.” Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport, team standings: 1st place):“When he crossed the finish line, the celebrations in the garage were deafening. To have won two races in a row and lead the Team competition feels damn good. I am delighted for Max. After the disappointment in Diriyah, where he was subsequently denied second place after the race, he has done it this time and claimed his first win. Together with his race engineer, he drove a very clever race. By using ATTACK MODE intelligently, he was first able to overtake Pascal Wehrlein and then pass Mitch Evans with a spectacular manoeuvre. Towards the end of the race, we saw that the two Techeetah cars were gaining rapidly, but we always knew that we were controlling the situation well and managing the temperature of the batteries better. We were proved right, as you could see with António at the end.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, qualifying result: 15th place, race result: DNF, points: 35, driver standings: 2nd place):“Firstly, I am incredibly pleased for Max and the team. Max had an outstanding qualifying, and he and the team did everything right in the race. I had good pace in the practice sessions too, but there was not much I could do in qualifying group one. The first laps of my race were pretty good. It was typical Formula E racing in the midfield; hard, but good. I then made slight contact with the wall, but damaged my car so severely that I had to retire from the race. As such, the result is obviously disappointing.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, qualifying result: 2nd place, race result: 1st place, points: 25, driver standings: 4th place):“Today is a dream come true. I am incredibly happy to take the first win of my Formula E career here in Santiago. Second place in qualifying was superb. Having not made a great start on the dirty side of the track, which cost me a position, we used ATTACK MODE very cleverly to allow me to take the lead. In the heat, it was also important to keep an eye on the temperature of the batteries. We did that really well. On the final lap, António had to coast a little earlier than me on the straight. I thought to myself ‘now or never’ and went for the overtake. Fortunately, it came off.” The BMW i Safety Cars.BMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 6. Spearheading the fleet are two Safety Cars: The BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car *, which has been specially modified for use at the racetrack, and the BMW i8 Coupé Safety Car *.

Carlos Sainz (ESP) and his co-driver Lucas Cruz (ESP) have won the Rally Dakar for the third time, having previously triumphed in 2010 and 2018. In doing so, they presented MINI with its fifth overall victory at the iconic endurance rally. For MINI and MINI Motorsport partner X-raid, this was the first success since their winning run together, which lasted from 2012 to 2015. The Spanish pair, in the MINI John Cooper Works Buggy, finished 6:21 minutes ahead of last year’s winner Nasser Al-Attiyah (QAT) after roughly 7,500 kilometres through Saudi Arabia, which was hosting the Dakar for the first time. Dakar record winner Stéphane Peterhansel (FRA) and his co-driver Paulo Fiuza (POR) finished third, 9:58 minutes behind Sainz and Cruz, to round off an impressive performance from the two MINI JCW Buggies. The two MINI JCW Buggy crews each won four stages, while MINI vehicles went fastest on a total of nine of the twelve days. Vaidotas Zala (LTU) \/ Saulius Jurgelenas (LTU), in a MINI JCW Rally, won the very first Dakar stage on Arabian soil on the opening day. Seven of the nine MINI crews that started the rally reached the finish in Al-Quiddia (KSA), four of them in the top ten. Orlando Terranova (ARG) and Bernardo ‘Ronnie’ Graue (ARG) finished in the top three on three days on their way to sixth place overall in the four-wheel drive MINI JCW Rally. Local favourite Yasir Seaidan (KSA) and his co-driver Alexey Kuzmich (RUS) were ninth and finished an excellent second on the closing stage. Jakub ‘Kuba’ Przygonski (POL) and co-driver Timo Gottschalk (GER) had their hopes of a top result dashed on the opening day when a technical issue resulted in them losing six hours. They eventually finished in 19th place, 8:35.18 seconds off the lead. MINI vehicles topped the overall standings after every one of the twelve legs at the 40th staging of the Dakar Rally. Zala and Jurgelenas got the ball rolling with victory on the opening stage, after which Terranova and Graue took the overall lead on day two. Sainz and Cruz claimed their first stage win on the third leg. That victory took them to the top of the overall standings – a position they held right through to the finish. Quotes from the 2020 Dakar Rally: Carlos Sainz“I am very, very happy. So much hard work, physical training and test work with the team has gone into getting this result. The race was fantastic for us drivers, but you had to work very hard, right from day one. It is hard to imagine, but it was a full-throttle rally from the word go. Right now, I just want to enjoy the success.” Stéphane Peterhansel“That was a bit of an odd Dakar for me. We decided at the last minute to change co-drivers, and then went straight into the race with Paulo Fiuza. I am happy with the result. We finished third, which was more than we would have expected at the start. The guys out in front were very quick and did not make any mistakes with the navigation. We did as well as we could have done.” Bernd Körber – Head of MINI“On behalf of the entire MINI family, I would like to congratulate Carlos Sainz, Lucas Cruz and the X-raid team on winning the 2020 Dakar Rally. At the same time, I also congratulate Stéphane Peterhansel and Paulo Fiuza on their podium finish. Unfortunately, this success is overshadowed by the tragic accidents involving Paulo Gonçalves and Edwin Straver, which have affected us all deeply. We wish the relatives every strength and Edwin Straver all the best for his recovery. Our drivers and the X-raid team performed superbly in Saudi Arabia, which was hosting the rally for the first time, and they were rewarded for the hard work they put in during preparations for the event. The MINI John Cooper Works Buggy proved to be fast and reliable on the very demanding and unfamiliar terrain. The fifth overall victory for MINI at the Dakar, and the first since 2015, is a very special moment for us all.” Sven Quandt – CEO X-raid“We are absolutely overwhelmed by this superb team result. We did not expect to finish first and third. It has been a fantastic race, with many battles for the lead. Carlos and Stéphane did an outstanding job. The performance of our MINI JCW fleet was absolutely top-notch. We are delighted to have finally won another Dakar with our MINIs after so many years of trying. To have four MINIs in the top ten and seven in the top 20 shows how reliable we are. Thank you to our staff and to everyone who has believed in us and supported us – particularly MINI and our partners.” For more information on the Dakar 2020, visit the organiser’s homepage here. 2020 Dakar Rally: Final results of MINI competitors PosDriverCo-Driver#MINITeamTime1. Carlos Sainz(ESP)Lucas Cruz(ESP)305MINI JCW BuggyBahrain JCW X‑raid Team42:59:173. Stéphane Peterhansel (FRA)Paulo Fiuza (POR)302MINI JCW BuggyBahrain JCW X‑raid Team+0:09:586. Orlando Terranova (ARG)Bernardo Graue(ARG)311MINI JCW RallyX-raid MINI JCW Team+1:12:159. Yasir Seaidan(KSA)Alexey Kuzmich(RUS)324MINI JCW RallyRace World Team+3:42:1714. AleksandrDorosinsky (RUS)Oleg Uperenko(LAT)355MINI ALL4 RacingX-raid MINI JCW Team+5:07:0617. Denis Krotov(RUS)Dmitry Tsyro(UKR)323MINI JCW RallyMSK Rally Team+7:38:0119. Jakub Przygonski(POL)Timo Gottschalk(GER)303MINI JCW RallyOrlen X-raid Team+8:35:18tbc Vaidotas Zala(LTU)Saulius Jurgelenas (LTU)319MINI JCW RallyAgrorodeotbcDNFVladimir Vasilyev(RUS)Vitaly Yevtyekhov (UKR)317MINI JCW RallyX-raid G-Energy \n"}

{"prompt":"Introduction of mild hybrid technology in further models – 40 models already comply with Euro 6d emission standard – additional drive variants for the BMW 1 Series and BMW 3 Series – broader range of leather options and interior trims for the BMW X5, the BMW X6 and the BMW X7. ->","completion":" Munich. From the spring of 2020, BMW will contribute towards a further reduction of consumption levels and the optimisation of the emission performance of current models through the use of systematically evolved drive technology. In parallel with the expansion of the range of models featuring all-electric and plug-in hybrid drive scheduled to follow during the course of the year, both the efficiency and the exhaust emission quality of petrol-driven vehicles will be significantly increased. This is ensured, inter alia, by innovative mild hybrid technology which, following the BMW 5 Series, will as from March\/April also be deployed in the BMW 3 Series as well as the model series BMW X3 and BMW X4. At the same time, in the spring of 2020, 33 further BMW models will already comply with the Euro 6d emission standard, which will not become obligatory until 2021.A further drive variant for the BMW 1 Series as well as additional engines for the BMW 3 Series Sedan and the BMW 3 Series Touring will enhance the diversity of available options in the premium compact and premium midrange segment. Additional options for interior design provide for greater individuality in the BMW X5, the BMW X6 and the BMW X7.Electric pulling power for efficiency and dynamics: Mild hybrid technology with 48-volt starter generator for further models. BMW is extending the use of mild hybrid technology to further models. This innovation, first introduced in the autumn of 2019 for the four model variants of the BMW 520d , comprises an extremely powerful 48-volt starter generator as well as an additional battery, and enhances both efficiency and dynamics of vehicles equipped with this technology. As from the spring of 2020, mild hybrid technology will also be featured as standard in the models BMW 320d Sedan , the BMW 320d Touring , the BMW 320d xDrive Sedan , the BMW 320d xDrive Touring , the BMW X3 xDrive20d and the BMW X4 xDrive20d .Mild hybrid technology provides significantly greater possibilities to make use of brake energy recuperation. The energy recuperated when accelerating and braking is not only used to provide electrically powered vehicle functions with energy but also to generate additional drive power. The 48-volt starter generator delivers an additional power output of up to 8 kW\/11 hp. The electric over-boost is made available very spontaneously, thus enhancing dynamics when starting off and accelerating from a standstill. During the journey, the electric over-boost can be used to support the combustion engine, enabling it to run as frequently as possible within an efficiency-optimised load range and to reduce consumption peaks. Moreover, when driving within inefficient operational ranges, it is possible to supply the 48-volt battery with additional energy from the starter generator by raising the load point when required.Furthermore, the 48-volt starter generator provides for exceptionally smooth switching off as well as a faster and thus more comfortable re-starting of the combustion engine when the Auto Start Stop function is used at road junctions or in traffic jams. When the vehicle decelerates, the combustion engine can be disconnected at a speed of less than 15 km\/h. The kinetic energy gained when decelerating further to a standstill is then used for recuperation. The efficiency-enhancing effect of the “coasting” function has also been optimised. At a speed of up to 160 km\/h, the combustion engine is no longer switched into idle mode but is completely disconnected. During the journey, engine re-start is also fast and comfortable. The optimised “coasting” function is available both in the COMFORT and ECO-PRO modes of the Driving Experience Switch.Optimised emission performance: 40 BMW models now already fulfil the future Euro 6d emission standard.With yet a further optimisation of the emission performance of numerous models, BMW is preparing well in advance for future legal requirements governing exhaust emissions. As from the spring of 2020, 33 further models from various model series will fulfil the Euro 6d exhaust emission standard. Consequently, 40 BMW models comply with the demands specified by the more stringent standard a year prior to the new emission regulation coming into force.The vehicles that will already comply with the Euro 6d emission standard as from the spring of 2020 include model variants of the BMW 1 Series, BMW 2 Series and BMW 3 Series as well as the BMW X1, BMW X2, BMW X3, BMW X4, BMW X5 and the BMW X6.New drive variants for the BMW 1 Series, the BMW 3 Series Sedan and the BMW 3 Series Touring.Starting in March 2020, additional drive variants will increase the diversity of the BMW 1 Series and BMW 3 Series model range. The BMW 120d will be added to the model range in the premium compact segment. The power generated by the car’s 2-litre, 140 kW\/190 hp four-cylinder diesel power unit featuring BMW TwinPower Turbo Technology is transferred to the front wheels via a standard 8-speed Steptronic transmission, allowing the new BMW 120d to accelerate from 0 to 100 km\/h in 7.3 seconds and to reach a top speed of 231 km\/h. The new BMW 120d is one of the models that already fulfil the Euro 6d emission standard.A new four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 2 litres and BMW TwinPower Turbo Technology complements the drive portfolio for the new BMW 3 Series. The power unit for the new BMW 318i Sedan and the new BMW 318i Touring delivers a maximum power output of 115 kW\/156 hp and a peak torque of 250 Nm. The standard equipment range for the new BMW 3 Series entry model includes an 8-speed Steptronic transmission. Acceleration from 0 to 100 km\/ is 8.4 seconds for the Sedan and 8.7 seconds for the Touring model. Top speed is 223 km\/h (BMW 318i Sedan) and 220 km\/h (BMW 318i Touring) respectively.BMW 7 Series and BMW 8 Series with extended standard configuration, additional offer of leather options and interior trims for the BMW X5, the BMW X6 and the BMW X7.From March 2020, a broader range of standard features will enhance comfort in the luxury-class models of the BMW 7 Series and the BMW 8 Series. In future, BMW 7 Series luxury sedans, BMW 8 Series luxury sports cars as well as the high-performance models BMW M8 Competition Coupe , BMW M8 Competition Convertible and BMW M8 Competition Gran Coupe will be equipped with an automatic soft-close function for the doors.Thanks to a wider selection of leather options and interior trims, there are now new possibilities to individualise the models BMW X5, BMW X6 and BMW X7. As from April, the leather trim perforated Vernasca in the colour Canberra Beige is additionally available for these three models. In the future, the BMW X6 can be ordered with the leather trim perforated Vernasca in the colour Cognac. Likewise available for the Sports Activity Coupe are the extended BMW Individual leather options Merino in the colours Tartufo and Ivory White and the colour combination Ivory White\/Night Blue as well as the BMW Individual all-leather interior trim Merino in the colours Coffee and Tartufo.

Another legend is also part of the action: the Morris Mini Cooper S Works Rally.  ->","completion":" Munich. Chilly weather is not to everybody’s taste but there are two huge advantages to a racing event for historic vehicles on ice: low tyre wear and “natural” cooling for engines running hot. At the weekend of 1 and 2 February 2020, the GP Ice Race will be held for the second time in the Austrian town of Zell am See. Motor-sport classics from different marques and derring-do drivers will battle together in enthralling duels on the frosty surface there. BMW Group Classic is taking part in the icy spectacle for the first time. Vehicles with a winner’s genetic makeup are being dispatched to the GP Ice Race 2020, including a first-generation BMW M3 which won the European Touring Car Hillclimb Championship twice before being converted to a successful rally vehicle, and a MINI ALL4 Racing, triumphant in the Dakar Rally in 2012. And the replica of the classic Mini Cooper S that created a sensation just a few weeks ago at the Coppa delle Alpi 2019 will also line up at the starting grid on the automotive ice rink in Zell am See.The GP Ice Race is a tribute to the legendary racing events that were held on the town’s frozen lake in each of the winter seasons between 1937 and 1974 and attracted large numbers of spectators. The new edition will take place on a natural ice track at the old airfield where modern racing cars piloted by numerous celebrity drivers compete alongside youngtimers and classic cars to test their mettle in a setting with a wintry mountain backdrop. The event programme also includes skijoring, which is one of the precursors for ice racing in Zell am See. Daredevil skiers used to be pulled along over the icy track by galloping horses and later by motorcycles and cars.BMW Group Classic is launching two historic racing cars on the ice. These winners achieved their biggest successes on very different terrain. A first-generation BMW M3 has been registered for the GP Ice Race 2020, which Francis Dosières drove to victory at the European Touring Car Hillclimb Championship in 1988 and 1989. In the subsequent year, the BMW M3 was converted to a rally car. And it also demonstrated its strengths in the new discipline. Dosières’ compatriot Patrick Artru was successful with it in the French Rally Championship for several years. The BMW M3 is being piloted by a local matador. The GP Ice Race counts as a home race for Salzburg-born DTM driver Philipp Eng.By contrast, sand and stones were once the territory of the MINI ALL4 Racing. In 2012, the two French drivers Stéphane Peterhansel and Jean-Paul Cottret drove the car to victory at the Dakar Rally. This was the first Dakar success for MINI. Eight years later, Christian Menzel is testing whether the MINI ALL4 Racing can shine with unstoppable tempo on ice as well as in the desert. And Menzel has a proven track record of experience as an endurance racing driver. In 1998, he was a member of the quartet of drivers that won the 24 Hour Race driving a BMW 320d on the Nürburgring.The replica of the Mini Cooper S in the rally version is having its second outing in the Alps within the space of just a few weeks. While the rubber was still hitting the snowy or cleared roads in December, this time the track is a sheet of pure ice. However, versatility has always been the forte of the most athletic version of the classic Mini. After all, the Mini Cooper S won the Monte Carlo Rally in the years 1964, 1965 and 1967.BMW Group Classic is also presenting two classic racing cars in Zell am See which once created a sensation at the 24 Hour Race of Le Mans. The BMW M1 entered the French endurance classic in 1981 and was an immediate eyecatcher with its unusual paintwork finish. Design artist Walter Maurer had styled the mid-engined sports car with hand-painted images of traditional Munich inns and city sights. The “Tavern Automobile” became a symbol of the close connection between BMW and local sponsors from Munich. It will be presented in Zell am See together with the Le Mans winner from 1999: the BMW V12 LMR. With this open-top sports car, BMW succeeded in achieving overall victory for the first time with a works car at the world’s most legendary endurance race.\n"}

The ‘BMW 120 at Daytona’ also heralds the intensive phase of preparations ahead of the opening round of this season’s IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. Just two weeks later, BMW Team RLL will take to the actual Daytona (USA) track, where it will be out to repeat last year’s victory in the GTLM class at the season-opener. At each BMW 120 race, the two winning drivers can look forward to a cheque for 1,200 US dollars each – and a starting place at the season finale. The second and third-placed teams will receive 1,200 and 600 US dollars. This year, BMW works drivers will once again regularly take part in BMW 120 races. BMW Team CATENG – consisting of Nicky Catsburg (NED) and Philipp Eng (AUT) – has its sights set on a strong result at Daytona. At the same time, iRacing is organising the new BMW 12.0 Series. The BMW M8 GTE will be the car of choice for these 12-minute races, which take place on different tracks every week. The sprint championship debuted at the start of December and is very popular among the 100,000 plus active iRacing users. In total, the BMW M8 GTE has already been selected for a wide range of races almost 120,000 times by drivers on iRacing.\n"}

BMW Art Journey winner Lu Yang (represented by the gallery Société, Berlin) begins her journey to Indonesia and India in January 2020. Lu Yang is the eighth recipient of the BMW Art Journey, a collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging artists worldwide. The artist aims to explore human mimicry of robots by capturing the movements of dancers in Indonesia and India. Lu Yang’s BMW Art Journey “Human Machine Reverse Motion Capture Project” will take her in January 2020 to Bali (Indonesia) and Kerala (India) studying how the human body can be trained to overcome its physical limitations. Her research will explore the deployment of the human body in historical and present-day cultures. Steeped in the latest digital technologies, Lu will employ sophisticated motion capture devices to record dancers’ gestures, including facial, finger- and eye-capture techniques that can collect and analyse the subtlest body movements, and will mimic these using robotic technologies.For her research, Lu will meet dancers of Legong, a traditional Balinese dance and practitioners of Kathakali in India. In Legong, for example, movement is controlled to such a degree that dancers are able to manipulate their finger joints individually. The facial and eye movements of India’s Kathakali dancers resemble the workings of sensors and motors in advanced humanoid robots.Lu Yang’s BMW Art Journey will look into how humans negotiate their evolving relationship with machines that may ultimately surpass human limitations.“The BMW Art Journey gives a great starting point for long-term research projects. This is not just an art journey. It will be a wonderful start for me to open a new chapter of my creation. I am very much looking forward to this future collaboration and the art-making after this journey. I would also like to thank the gallery Société in Berlin for fully supporting me”, says Lu Yang.Art Basel and BMW will collaborate with the artist to document the journey and share it with a broader public through print publications, online and social media.About Lu YangLu Yang (b. 1984) is a Shanghai-based multi-media artist, who graduated from the New Media Art Department of the China Academy of Art.

The legendary BMW Junior Team celebrates its comeback after more than 40 years. Eddie Cheever (USA), Manfred Winkelhock (GER) and Marc Surer (SUI) caused a stir in the world of motorsport in 1977, and 2020 will see a new generation of promising talents contest races under the name BMW Junior Team. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) will complete a holistic, first-class, intensive training programme designed to cover two seasons that will set new standards in the promotion of young talented drivers. One of their mentors will be the man who founded the first BMW Junior Team in 1977: Jochen Neerpasch. The objective of the totally new training concept is to further develop the Juniors jointly in many different areas, stimulate them individually and holistically, and thereby make them better and above all more mature racing drivers. The BMW Junior Team will start its training program me on 9th January when they move into a shared flat close to Formula Medicine in Viareggio (ITA), where a training camp spanning several weeks awaits them. Here the focus will be on fitness and mental training as fundamental elements of preparing for the race season. Another pillar of the programme is the team concept. To strengthen this, once the training camp comes to an end, the Juniors will move into a shared flat near the Nürburgring (GER), which will become the focal point of their racing driver training. At the wheel of various BMW racing cars – from the new BMW M2 CS Racing through the BMW M4 GT4 to the BMW M6 GT3 – the BMW Junior Team will complete the entire season of the Nürburgring endurance series as well as the 24 Hours of Nürburgring. On top of the racing commitments come numerous additional training elements. Sim racing will play a major role, as will learning about operations away from pure racing, for example, at BMW M GmbH and in various other areas within the BMW Group. “I would like to extend a warm welcome to the BMW family to Dan Harper, Max Hesse and Neil Verhagen as members of the new generation of the BMW Junior Team,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “The rebirth of the legendary BMW Junior Team after more than 40 years is something very special to us here at BMW Motorsport, all the more since we were able to secure the founder of the then BMW Junior Team and of BMW Motorsport GmbH, Jochen Neerpasch, as one of the mentors for the new generation. This sees tradition and future meet in what is a perfect configuration from our perspective. The new Juniors will be a real team and learn a great deal as part of our holistic, first-class, intensive programme both on and off the track. Our new concept is based on multiple pillars: racing at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife, sim racing as a new, future-oriented area, mental and fitness training at Formula Medicine, training content within the BMW Group, and team building through living together in shared accommodation. With this comprehensive concept, we are raising our junior development to another new level.” Jochen Neerpasch said: “When I founded the first BMW Junior Team in 1977, we at BMW Motorsport were pioneers in junior development. We made training young racing drivers a professional undertaking for the first time. Now, being involved in the advancement of a BMW Junior Team again after more than 40 years is a real joy. I know from experience that young drivers learn a lot more quickly when they act as a team rather than just battling for themselves. It was on this basis that, in collaboration with those in charge at BMW Motorsport, the idea of reviving the BMW Junior Team came into being. I’m fascinated by the thought that these three Juniors will learn together on the most difficult racetrack in the world and will also receive training in many other areas. I’m confident that the three of them will make their way into professional racing. We will do our best to give them the ideal basis for this.” The trio making up the new BMW Junior Team has already gained experience and their first successes in racing. 19-year-old Dan Harper won the title in the British Carrera Cup in 2019 and his achievements saw him nominated for the prestigious Autosport Awards. 18-year-old Max Hesse celebrated winning the title in the rapidly growing touring car series TCR Germany in 2019. He was also ADAC’s sponsored candidate. Also 18 years old, Neil Verhagen finished in sixth place overall in the star-studded British F3 Championship in 2019 and was part of the Red Bull Junior programme. During their training, the trio will receive support from other mentors in addition to Neerpasch. Aside from BMW works driver Philipp Eng (AUT) and Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli (ITA) of Formula Medicine, BMW works driver Dirk Adorf (GER), who has been acting as a mentor for the BMW Motorsport Juniors since 2011, will have primary responsibility for looking after the interests of the talented youngsters. “I’m really looking forward to going through the two-year programme alongside our Juniors,” said Adorf. “The lads are already very strong and will be trained by us in all areas offered by the BMW Motorsport and BMW Group environment. On top of this, they will be learning on the best racetrack in the world. If they are quick there, they will no doubt do well everywhere. I am very familiar with the Nürburgring and am always available there for the Juniors as a primary advisor. With my track knowledge, but also with my knowledge of the region. When they are living in a flat there they will also need someone to answer standard everyday questions. I think that I will be able to help them get to know lots of people and to feel at home.” An overview of the 2020 BMW Junior Team: Dan Harper (GBR).Date of birth: 8th December 2000Place of birth: Belfast (GBR) Career:2019 1st place British Carrera Cup BRDC John Surtees Rising Stars Award2018 ‘Rookie of the Year’ British Carrera Cup Dan Harper: “I feel honoured to be allowed to be part of this exciting programme and am really looking forward to the next two years.

I’m looking forward to the Nordschleife in particular, because I’ve only been in action there as a co-driver so far. The track has so much prestige and history – I would really love to be able to say that I have driven on it myself and maybe after my training even say that I do well on that track. I’m also really looking forward to the sim racing since I’m already active in that area.”\n"}
{"prompt":"Designed for local emission-free mobility, the model demonstrates its impressive everyday capability and durability with its original battery – since its market launch, the BMW i3 has been the most widely sold electric vehicle in the premium compact segment with more than 165,000 units already sold worldwide. ->","completion":" Munich. Trailblazer for sustainable mobility and endurance runner – within the six years following its launch, the BMW i3 has become an extremely successful model and a symbol of electric mobility. Since its market launch, it has been the most widely sold electric vehicle in the premium compact segment. More than 165,000 units have been sold worldwide to date. And since the car’s launch, sales figures have steadily increased year after year. The BMW i3 convinces in everyday use with a future-oriented interpretation of driving pleasure and versatile qualities reaching far beyond driving short distances in major metropolitan regions. This is underscored by the experience gained by electric car pioneers who regularly travel longer distances in their BMW i3 and have each completed more than 200,000 emission-free kilometres.Thanks to its role as a visionary technology flagship and continuing sales success since its launch in 2013, the BMW i3 has acquired the status of an icon. The BMW Group will continue to further develop this vehicle and currently plans to extend production until at least 2024. Customers emphasize above all the reliability, durability and the practicable range of the BMW i3, whether in the heat of South Africa or in the cool north of Sweden. The first all-electric vehicle from the BMW Group has for years now proven everywhere to be a cost-effective means of transport that is fully suitable for day-to-day use. Customers who had their BMW i3 delivered shortly after its launch and since then have subjected both the vehicle and its original battery to a real endurance test, use sustainable mobility not only for daily commuting between home and the workplace, but also regularly for longer distances and even holiday trips.Over 277,000 kilometres with the original set of brake pads.“The vehicle concept of the BMW i3 is unique,” comments Helmut Neumann from the community of Titz in North Rhine Westphalia. “It looks so modern from the outside that people still turn around to catch a glimpse of it.” Neumann has been driving around locally emission-free since 2014 and even drove his BMW i3 BMW . The increased output of 135 kW\/184 PS hp adds to driving pleasure and the high-voltage battery’s extended storage capacity “makes daily life even easier”, he says. “And longer journeys are now more comfortable and faster.” To prepare for long journeys Gonçalves uses the navigation system of the BMW i3. “It plans my route and indicates quick charging stations along the way, so I can be sure of reaching my destination without any problems.”\n"}

Its flax cooling shaft emphasises its great importance as a tech lab for the BMW Group, being the first BMW race car fielded by a works team with parts made out of renewable textile fibres – making it a pioneer for series production. “The flax cooling shaft that we use in the BMW iFE.20 is further proof of the hugely important role of BMW i Motorsport as a tech lab for the BMW Group,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “We are consistently using Formula E as an innovative platform for series development – in this instance for testing flax in extreme weather conditions. What’s particularly remarkable is the fact that in some areas this renewable material even has advantages over materials established in racing, such as carbon. Our ambition is to always use the best suited material for each part.” Compared with carbon, flax has greater absorption and greater impact resistance, which can be advantageous on the street circuits with their bumps and crash barriers, on which Formula E takes place. The same is true of contact with other cars during races. The BMW iFE.20 is the first works BMW racing car in which the material is used. However, the expansion of this concept to include other BMW Motorsport race cars is currently already in the development phase.\n"}

The squad of drivers at BMW M Motorsport for the coming DTM season is taking shape with Lucas Auer (AUT) returning to the touring car series after a one-year break. He will start in the BMW M4 DTM in 2020. The 25-year-old can call on the wealth of experience gained in 73 races in the touring car series, of which he won four. Alongside Auer, four familiar faces will continue to drive for BMW in the DTM: two-time champion Marco Wittmann (GER), Philipp Eng (AUT), Timo Glock (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA). Joel Eriksson (SWE) will no longer be in action in the BMW M4 DTM. “Welcome back to the DTM, Lucas Auer,” says BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “I am obviously particularly happy, not only to be able to welcome him back to the DTM, but also to welcome him into the BMW family. In his 73 DTM races so far, Lucas has emphatically shown what he is capable of and, with four wins and ten podiums, has proven that he can mix it at the very front of the field. We believe that he will fit in very well with us, not only because of his huge potential as a driver, but also his friendly nature.” “I am really excited about returning to the DTM with BMW,” says Auer. “During my career, I have been in contact with BMW Motorsport on several occasions, but it all came together this time. I am counting down the days until I get into the car for the first time. I took a big step forward personally last year in Japan. The key now will be to adapt quickly to the DTM again. However, I am not worried about that.” Auer made his DTM debut with Mercedes in 2015. His first victory followed in 2016 at the Lausitzring (GER). 2017 was his most successful DTM season so far, with another three race wins at Hockenheim (GER), the Lausitzring again and at the Nürburgring (GER). Auer’s last race to date came at Hockenheim in mid-October 2018. Last season, he competed in the Japanese Super Formula series – formerly Formula Nippon – among other things. Wittmann, Glock, Eng and van der Linde remain on board.Alongside Auer, four drivers who have already experienced action at the wheel of the BMW M4 DTM since 2018 will compete for BMW again in next season’s DTM: Wittmann and Glock are both entering their eighth season, while Eng returns for another crack at the DTM title in his third year. Van der Linde is looking to take the next step in 2020, after a debut season that produced a number of highlights. “We have gone for continuity with four of our drivers for next season,” says Marquardt. “With his speed and incredible consistency, Marco Wittmann is a top performer in our DTM squad every season. He nearly always makes the very most of any opportunities he gets. Timo Glock was very unfortunate last season. However, there is no doubting his pace at the wheel of the BMW M4 DTM. Philipp Eng performed fantastically in 2019, particularly in the first half of the season. Hopefully he can build on that next year. Sheldon van der Linde impressed us in his rookie season. We see great potential in him, which he will hopefully fulfil more often in 2020.” Eriksson bids farewell to the DTM.Joel Eriksson will no longer drive for BMW in the DTM in 2020. He contested 37 races in the BMW M4 DTM and took victory at Misano (ITA) in 2018. In total, he made three appearances on the podium. He is currently racing for FIST-Team AAI in the BMW M6 GT3 in the Asian Le Mans Series. We will announce at a later date who will take his place in the DTM. “I would like to thank Joel Eriksson for the great cooperation over the past two years in the DTM.

{"prompt":"Entering a new era of electric mobility:  The efficient drivetrain for the purely electric BMW iX3. Trailblazer for fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology – Innovations for electric motor and high-voltage battery - Additional range thanks to higher efficiency instead of larger battery.   ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW iX3, the production of which will commence in 2020, facilitates locally emission-free driving in a novel and efficient form, whilst also being suitable for everyday use. A range of more than 440 km* within the legislative WLTP test cycle will be achieved with a net-battery size of 74 kWh*. The first purely electric Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) is the trailblazer for BMW eDrive technology of the fifth generation, which, starting 2021, will also be deployed in the BMW i4 and the BMW iNEXT. For this purpose, both the drive system and the high-voltage battery unit featuring pioneering battery cell technology have been completely redeveloped. In the BMW iX3, the related advancement ensures brand-typical driving experience combined with outstanding efficiency and a novel balance of weight and range. The BMW iX3 is yet a further milestone in the consistent realisation of the BMW Group’s electrification strategy. In 2020 the BMW X3 will become the brand’s first model available both with conventional petrol and diesel engines as well as plug-in hybrid and purely electric drive. With this “power of choice” offer, the globally operating company is taking into account the various different requirements and needs of their worldwide customers worldwide as well as maximum effectiveness in the reduction of CO2 emissions. The BMW iX3 is produced for the world market by the joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive in Shenyang, China. * = preliminary data________________________. The fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology is the key to future-oriented sustainability for vehicles with electrified drive systems. It is the result of consistent development work within the framework of BMW EfficientDynamics and the experience gained by the BMW Group in the field of electric mobility spanning more than 10 years. All powertrain components used for BMW eDrive technology were developed solely by the BMW Group. Moreover, the electric motor and the high-voltage batteries are produced in corporately owned manufacturing facilities. In this way, the BMW Group ensures it has a decisive influence on the product properties and the quality of each component. Furthermore, the drive unit and the high-voltage battery unit are flexibly scalable in terms of power and energy content and can thus be used in various different vehicle concepts and segments. EfficientDynamics at its best: New drive component with high efficiency and brand-typical power characteristics. In the BMW iX3, EfficientDynamics reaches a new level. The vehicle’s fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology comprises a drive unit in which electric motor, system electronics and transmission are brought together into a central housing. As a result, the required installation space of the drive technology and its weight are considerably reduced. The ratio between motor output and weight of the drive system improves around 30 percent compared to the previous generation.The electric motor featured in the BMW iX3 delivers a maximum power output of 210 kW\/286 hp*. The torque of 400 Nm* allows for high initial acceleration and keeps a high level even at the upper motor speeds because of exclusive BMW design measures. A further special feature of the electric motor being deployed in the BMW iX3 for the first time is a construction method that eliminates the need for rare earth materials. The electric motor used in the BMW iX3 transfers power to the rear wheels. This effectuates a further increase in drive system efficiency. Moreover, the range of the BMW iX3 benefits from the drive design conveying the traditional BMW rear-wheel drive experience. High-voltage batteries with significant higher energy density and responsible use of raw materials.The high-voltage battery unit of the BMW iX3 is integral part of BMW’s fifth eDrive generation and is based on the latest evolution in NMC-811 technology in BMW typical prismatic design. The BMW Group has outstanding development capabilities in this field. This know-how flows into precise specifications with regard to the use of materials and battery design, according to which the battery cells are produced. Consistent research and development work not only raises energy density but also constantly improves all battery cell characteristics, in particular also durability and safety. In total, the BMW high-voltage battery shows the optimum of what is possible nowadays.At the same time the BMW engineers were able to reduce the share of cobalt contained in the battery by another two thirds. Compared to former technology used by BMW Group, the gravimetric energy density on cell level in the BMW iX3 is around 20 percent higher.With the BMW iX3 the raw materials Cobalt and Lithium for the first time are purchased by BMW directly and then handed over to the producer of the battery cells.In addition, scalability and the compact design of the high-voltage battery unit have been further optimised. The battery cells are grouped into modules at specialised BMW production locations and finally assembled as high-voltage battery packs aligned to each model. The high-voltage battery unit in the BMW iX3 is installed in an extremely flat position in the vehicle floor. Thanks to this arrangement, there is no loss of space for passengers and the luggage compartment compared to the conventionally powered versions of the BMW X3. Greater range thanks to high efficiency rather than a bigger batteryWith a net energy content of 74 kWh*, the high-voltage battery unit installed in the BMW iX3 achieves a range of more than 440 km* in the legislative WLTP test cycle. Within its segment, the BMW iX3 boasts not only a unique low power consumption of less than 20 kWh\/100km* accordingly to the WLTP test cycle, but also stands for a novel ratio between battery size and range. Thanks to the favourable efficiency rating of the drive components and the high energy density of the high-voltage battery unit, the BMW iX3 achieves a range that is only possible for common electric vehicles with larger and thus heavier batteries. Positive environmental impact secured.The “real” ecological footprint of electric vehicles is sometimes questioned, particularly in markets still having a low percentage of green electricity in the public power grid. At the BMW Group every electrified model has to proof that for the entire cycle, comprising raw material procurement, supply chain, production and usage phase as well as recycling, its CO2 balance is substantially better than the one of a conventionally powered sibling. For the BMW iX3 the related advantage is more than 30 percent compared to a BMW X3 sDrive 20d when average European power supply is used during the car’s usage phase. If the vehicle is charged with green electricity the advantage is around 60 percent.Furthermore, in analogy with the BMW i3 Plug&Play technology, the high-voltage battery featured in the BMW iX3 is planned for a second life as a stationary battery pack for the period following the first long life in the car. This way the already positive CO2 balance of the BMW iX3 can be further improved.* = preliminary data\n"}

I’m excited for the new challenge and can’t wait for the season to get started.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M8 GTE): “We finished last season with a podium and naturally we wish to build on that in the BMW M8 GTE's third season in the IMSA series. We have made a few improvements within the team and already made some progress over the winter. I'm excited to see how much we will have boosted our performance. Our driver line-up is very strong. I think we are ready for the season opener at Daytona.” John Edwards (#24 BMW M8 GTE): “I’m really excited to be rejoining BMW Team RLL, especially as I keep Jesse as my teammate and also our engineer. This consistency will hopefully help us to further improve on the track as well. We had some good races last year, but all in all it was a bit up and down and didn’t result in a good championship position. The goal is to be more consistent in 2020.” Jesse Krohn (#24 BMW M8 GTE): “As I will go into my third year in this series, the learning should be done. For me it’s time to execute now. I know the team and we work really well together. I don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t have a good season in 2020. I’m really looking forward to it.”\n"}

The Canadian’s greatest success came in 2012, when he won the Drivers’ Championship in the BMW Bank M3 DTM. ->","completion":" Munich. Bruno Spengler (CAN) will swap the BMW M4 DTM for a BMW M8 GTE next season, when he will race in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. This move sees Spengler bring the curtain down on a dazzling DTM career, which has spanned 15 years and 195 races and produced a host of highlights. The Canadian’s greatest success came in 2012, when he won the Drivers’ Championship in the BMW Bank M3 DTM. Spengler’s first race as a regular driver for BMW Team RLL in the BMW M8 GTE is just around the corner. He will compete in the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) at the end of January. Spengler will also remain a reserve and test driver for BMW i Andretti Motorsport in the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. “Very few drivers have had as big an influence on the DTM as Bruno Spengler has in the past 15 years,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “In winning the title in his first season for BMW in 2012, he achieved something that nobody believed possible at the time. In doing so, he earned a permanent place in the history of BMW Motorsport. Of the 122 DTM races he has contested for us, he won seven. His latest victory at the Norisring last season was another very emotional one. The fact that he broke the 1000-point mark in his 15th season in 2019 underlines the outstanding status that Bruno has earned for himself in the DTM. Nevertheless, we were of the opinion that 2020 is the right time to head in a new direction together for the coming years. This decision was not an easy one for us. However, as we do at the end of every season, we took a very close look at our squad of drivers and are confident that Bruno, with all his experience, can help us make progress in the IMSA series. He will also be used as a reserve and test driver in Formula E. I am happy that we are able to keep Bruno as a valuable member of the BMW family. We will ensure that he can bid a worthy farewell to BMW fans in the DTM next year.” “Firstly, I am obviously disappointed that I will no longer be racing in the DTM in 2020,” said Spengler. “I had a fantastic time for 15 years, during which time the DTM became part of my family. I have been racing in the DTM for almost half of my life. In my 195 races, I have enjoyed some fantastic success – above all, of course, my title win with BMW at Hockenheim in 2012. This title win will forever be very closely linked to Charly Lamm for me. As a sportsman, I would obviously have liked to have stuck around for a few more years. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all my mechanics and engineers who I have worked with all these years, and with whom I have celebrated so many successes. Even though it has come as something of a surprise to me that I won’t be contesting my 16th DTM season, I’m looking ahead. I feel right at home in the BMW family, am about to face a new challenge, and am ready to write a new chapter in my career. I know the BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL and some of the circuits in North America. As such, I think I will find my feet quickly there. For me as a Canadian, it will certainly be a highlight to line up at a genuine home race for the first time in a long time, at the race at Mosport in the summer. I will really miss the DTM fans. I am looking forward to saying ‘goodbye’ to them in 2020.” Spengler initially drove for Mercedes in the DTM between 2005 and 2011, during which time he twice finished runner-up in the Drivers’ Championship. When BMW returned to the series in 2012, he switched manufacturer and promptly won the title at the first attempt in a dramatic season. During his DTM career, Spengler won 16 races, secured pole position 18 times, and made it onto the podium 51 times. In total, he amassed 1,024 points.\n"}

This season, it is holding race events in Asia and Australia. The team is one of the most successful ones in the ARRC. In the 2019 season, they celebrated the win of the Rider title with Azlan Shah Kamaruzaman (MAS). The Onexox BMW TKKR Racing Team is a private customer team. BMW Motorrad Motorsport will provide extensive support for Reiterberger’s involvement in the 2020 ARRC season. “We are delighted that Markus will still be part of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family,” said BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “We are confident that he will be one of the top riders in the Asia Road Racing Championship from the very first race. He is very familiar with the BMW S 1000 RR and, in the Onexox BMW TKKR Racing Team, he will be racing for one of the strongest teams in the series. We at BMW Motorrad Motorsport will do our bit to make it a successful season by offering technical support, among other things.” “I am already excited about the Asia Road Racing Championship and am looking forward to riding with the Onexox BMW TKKR Racing Team in the coming season,” said Reiterberger. “This championship is getting stronger all the time and is attracting more and more international interest, including from manufacturers. The squad has shown this season that it is one of the best teams in the series. I think we can achieve a lot together in 2020. I have shown that I do well on the Superstock versions of the RR, not least as Superstock European champion. All the ingredients for a strong season are in place and I am looking forward to getting started.” “It is splendid to have Markus Reiterberger in the Onexox BMW TKKR Racing Team for the 2020 season,” said Team Principal Bobie Farid. “He brings with him a wealth of motor racing experience, and that can only push the Onexox BMW TKKR Racing Team forward. It will be a marvellous learning curve for the team to become more competitive and set a new standard of performance in the Asian Road Racing Championship. The Onexox BMW TKKR Racing Team is keen to build on our strong performance with Azlan Shah in 2019, and we obviously would like to continue winning races and scoring podium finishes consistently. We will be working hard with our partners to be competitive, and it will be about building a winning mentality across all aspects of the Onexox BMW TKKR Racing Team as well. We expect the on-track rivalry between the teams to be relentless, but we believe the team will be at the sharper end of the grid in the 2020 season.” \n"}

Second race, second podium for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC): Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Markus Reiterberger (GER) secured third place at the “Sepang 8 Hours” (MAS) with the #37 BMW S 1000 RR. Heavy rain forced Saturday’s race at the “Sepang International Circuit” to be reduced from eight to three hours. The newly established BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is in second place in the overall standings of the World Championship after two races of the season. Team manager Werner Daemen’s (BEL) team qualified in fifth for the second round of the 2019\/20 season of the FIM EWC. Mikhalchik and Reiterberger took it in turns on the saddle of the #37 RR. Their team-mate Kenny Foray (FRA) injured himself when he fell during a practice session on Wednesday, and was unable to take part in the remainder of the race weekend. The race in Sepang turned into a test of patience for everyone involved. The race was scheduled to start at 13:00 local time, but hours of heavy rain made it impossible to stick to the published schedule. The race started later than planned and behind the safety car, but was red-flagged after just a few laps. The conditions only improved at around 18:00 local time, enabling the race to be completed with a reduced duration of around three hours. Mikhalchik and Reiterberger initially rode in fifth place, but a flawless performance saw them move up into third place during the course of the race. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team maintained this podium position down to the finish line. Privateer team BMW Sepang Racing finished in eighth place. Azlan Shah Kamarazuman (MAS), Adam Norrodin (MAS) and Julien Da Costa (FRA) took it in turns on the saddle of the #48 BMW S 1000 RR. Two BMW teams secured spots on the podium in the Superstock class. Second place went to GERT56 by GS YUASA with Stefan Kerschbaumer (AUT), Lucy Glöckner (GER) and Pepijn Bijsterbosch (NED). The #56 RR finished in 14th place in the overall rankings. Hoshino Tomoya, Kokoro Atsumi and Takeshi Ishizuka (all JPN) finished third in the Superstock class on the #80 RR of TONE RT SYNCEDGE 4413 BMW . Quotes after the “Sepang 8 Hours”. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The second podium in our second race in the FIM EWC – this is a fantastic result for our new BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. We couldn’t have necessarily expected this as newcomers in this highly competitive World Championship. The team and our riders Ilya and Markus weren’t distracted by the adverse conditions. They did yet another fantastic, flawless job on the track and in the pit. On this occasion, I also want to send a get well soon message to Kenny, who surely will be back with us soon. Of course, we would have liked to get more riding in to gain more experience in race conditions with our RR, but it wasn’t possible in this weather. Now we will keep focussing on preparing for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Congratulations go to our BMW customer teams as well, who also got strong results with their RR.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “I’m a very proud team manager today. It’s a shame that Kenny wasn’t able to take part, but Ilya and Markus did a really great job as a duo. The conditions on the wet track were very treacherous, and the day wasn’t easy overall. But the whole team did a really great job. And the pit stops were world class. Now we’re hoping for a similarly strong result in the next race in Le Mans.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “First of all I want to say get well soon to our third rider Kenny, who unfortunately got injured in practice, and I hope that we will be back together soon, because it’s a team sport and it’s important to have the entire team together. Overall I’m, of course, really happy with the race. We have been strong in all conditions. At the beginning of the race, there was a lot of water on the track and I think that everyone was a bit scared of that. But everyone adapted and, while it was difficult in the early stages, it became better with every lap. Also the grip was there then. We did not quite have the pace of the winners, but we were very constant on every lap and this was important. I could have pushed more, but it was risky and it was our strategy to ride more consistently. This paid off, this was our target and we did our job. We are very happy to be on the podium and thanks a lot to my team. We did this together.” Markus Reiterberger: “I am really happy to be back in endurance racing. It was a pity that Kenny was injured and I wish him a speedy recovery. We had to do today’s race with two riders. In the end it was only three hours. We decided that Ilya would ride at the start and he did a really good job. I’m really happy with how qualifying and the race went. I still had to adapt to the Dunlop tyres that were new for me, but the team did a really good job and I felt very comfortable on the bike. My race pace was not quite as fast as I had hoped for, but in the end it was more important not to crash and to bring home the result. Ilya did a great last stint, we secured third place and I think this is a really good team achievement.” \n"}

The December DTM Young Driver Test at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP) has established itself as a permanent fixture in the DTM off-season. This year, BMW M Motorsport offered two drivers the opportunity to attend the test and take to the track in the BMW M4 DTM, namely Robert Kubica (POL) and BMW works driver Nick Yelloly (GBR) from the GT racing scene. As preparations for the 2020 season continue, Marco Wittmann (GER) and Philipp Eng (AUT) were also in action in southern Spain. The three-day test took place from Wednesday to Friday. BMW M Motorsport ran two BMW M4 DTMs at Jerez de la Frontera and used the three days to evaluate various technical concepts for next season at the racetrack. Kubica and Yelloly alternated at the wheel of one car, while Wittmann and Eng shared the work in the cockpit of the other BMW M4 DTM. Test conditions were consistently good on all three days, with dry and partly sunny weather. This allowed BMW M Motorsport and its four drivers to work through an extensive programme. In total, they completed more than 700 laps, or more than 3,200 kilometres. Quotes from the DTM Test and DTM Young Driver Test at Jerez. Marco Wittmann: “It is always nice to attend the winter test. Since the finale at Hockenheim, I have actually been back in the BMW M4 DTM every month – first at the Fuji Dream Race and now here at Jerez. That is great. It was a good and productive test. We were able to get through a lot of the work we had planned. They were very good days, during which we gained new knowledge, which we must now try to implement for 2020. We know we still have some work ahead of us, in order to be well prepared for the start of the new season. As such, the winter test is very important. I am happy and satisfied. I will now take a well-earned, short winter break over Christmas and New Year, during which I can spend time with family and friends and switch off a little.” Philipp Eng: “I was pleased to be able to get back in the seat of the BMW M4 DTM with Christmas just around the corner, as it has been quite a while since the Hockenheim finale. The winter tests are always very intense with an extensive programme of work. It was good that we had consistent conditions throughout the test. That meant we could use the days at Jerez very productively. We were able to move in the right direction in many regards, as we prepare for the 2020 season. That puts me in a positive mood and I can now enjoy the Christmas holidays.” Nick Yelloly: “I really enjoyed driving the BMW M4 DTM with the turbo engine. Compared to last year’s test, when I drove the 2018 M4, it’s quite a big change in terms of torque mostly and how the braking works. It was a big learning curve for me and I really enjoyed the test. Despite the fact we had some fog in the morning, I feel we managed to get a lot out of the car quite quickly and I learnt a lot about the long-runs. You have to look after the tyres in a completely different way compared to last year, and I learnt that early on. We got through a lot of work and a great amount of mileage, so another big thank you to BMW for the opportunity.” Robert Kubica: “It has certainly been a very productive test. It was my first time in the new generation of DTM cars. There have been a lot of things to learn and a lot of things to discover as, of course, it was different to what I was used to in the past years. There have been a few things about the DTM car that surprised me positively. On my first laps in the car I felt comfortable straight away, which is always something a driver is looking for when testing and discovering new cars. Because if you feel comfortable and confident, you lap quicker and your life becomes easier. So, definitely the driveabilty of the car really surprised me positively. There are, of course, some differences to a Formula One car that you can feel – like the weight of the car and although DTM cars have a lot of downforce it is less than in Formula One. Nevertheless, I think it is a really pleasant car to drive and a very advanced car also from a technical aspect. I really enjoyed the test and working with the team. I think we got through a lot of stuff with a successful outcome so yes, I am pretty happy.”\n"}

Despite that success, the goal for the remaining races remains unchanged and the 2019\/20 season will serve as a learning year, to further develop the endurance version of the RR. Quotes ahead of the 8 Hours of Sepang. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The Sepang race is a new challenge for us for several reasons. It is only the second race for our new project in the FIM EWC. We know the track from 2016 from WorldSBK but it is new for the new BMW S 1000 RR and the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team so the team first had to learn it in the sessions completed so far. This is compounded by the fact that Kenny unfortunately got injured and can’t continue to race at Sepang, so Ilya and Markus have the difficult task of sharing duties between them over the eight hours of racing in tropical conditions. But we are confident that Ilya and Markus are fit enough to master the physically demanding conditions – and also that the team is well prepared. Over the past days, the squad has intensively worked on setting the BMW S 1000 RR up for Sepang’s special requirements and made good progress. P5 on the grid is a very satisfying result, especially when you know that Markus got a wrong gear in the first sector and lost a lot of time. We are optimistic and looking forward to the race. And we wish Kenny a speedy recovery – get well soon, Kenny! “ Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “After the difficult Wednesday with Kenny’s injury we went to bed with mixed feelings, but then Thursday has been a very good day for us. Ilya and Markus rode very well and in general, qualifying has been pretty successful for us. Unfortunately, Kenny has to sit out the rest of the weekend but we hope that he will be fully fit again soon. Now we are looking forward to the race. We will try to have a race without any issues and mistakes and then we will see what we can achieve.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “Qualifying was not so bad but also not perfect. Unfortunately I could not use our full potential on the fast lap as we had a small grip issue. But I am confident for the race as we have a good race pace and this is more important than a fast lap in qualifying. We are ready, even it will be difficult as Markus and me have to share duties between us as two riders. I want to say get well soon to our team-mate Kenny and hopefully we will soon be back all together on the track.” Markus Reiterberger: “Thursday was a good day. We’ve made more progress with the bike, especially regarding the chassis and the electronics. This for sure will help us on the race distance of eight hours. Unfortunately, Kenny got injured on Wednesday, and Ilya and me now have to ride as a two-rider line-up. I want to wish Kenny a speedy recovery! Ilya and me shared duties and I think that we did a good job. It was exciting to compete in the Top 10 Trial. I’ve participated in many Superpoles but never in a format like this. It’s great and I really like it. Unfortunately I made a small mistake which cost some time, but fifth on the grid is not bad and now we will see what we can achieve in the race. I think that we are a strong team and well prepared.” Kenny Foray: “The feeling with the bike here on this track was really incredible and I enjoyed riding here. But then heavy rain came on Wednesday afternoon and we did not ride a lot. When I then went out for my first lap of the night practice I had a heavy high-side. I am of course disappointed as it is the first time in my career that I will miss a race. It’s a pity but know that my team-mates are working really well and I am sure that they can do a really good job. I cross my fingers for them and give them all my support to get a good result on Saturday.” \n"}

Todd continued his success story over the remainder of the season and wrapped up the title at the penultimate race weekend in Hořice (CZE) – with another two race wins. Todd scored maximum points in nine of the twelve races that made up this season’s IRRC. This proved sufficient for him to take overall victory in the 2019 Race Trophy – and saw him also crowned ‘Rookie of the Year’ in the Race Trophy. However, Todd was not only successful in the IRRC. He also enjoyed great success at major international road racing events. He finished third in the Superstock class at the North West 200 and runner-up at the Ulster Grand Prix, again in the Superstock race. “I’m very happy to have won the BMW Motorrad Race Trophy, and also proud”, said Todd. “The competition is very high as so many really strong BMW riders from different championships around the world take part, so it’s great to be the best of them, even more as I was a newcomer. I had a great first season in the International Road Racing Championship. Honestly, I did not expect to be able get so many wins and podiums when I headed to the first round, as in the IRRC there are so many very experienced and fast road racers. But I had a strong bike and an experienced team around me, so we were able to set the pace in the series from the first race on – and that enabled me also to claim strong results in other road racing events like the podiums at the North West 200 and the Ulster Grand Prix. I want to thank everybody who made this possible.” Todd won the 2019 Race Trophy with 475.27 points. Second-placed Ukrainian rider Mikhalchik picked up his 460.00 Race Trophy points with the alpha Racing-Van-Zon-BMW team in the International German Championship (IDM), in which he was crowned champion for the second year in a row. Third-placed Frenchman Gines won the title in the French Superbike Championship (FSBK) with the Tecmas Racing Team. His results in that series earned him 442.15 Race Trophy points. Champions on the BMW S 1000 RR.As well as Todd, Mikhalchik and Gines, a further six BMW racers won titles in their respective series in 2019.

Gabriele Piana (ITA) and Hofor Racing are the winners of the Drivers’ and Team competitions in this year’s BMW Sports Trophy. BMW Motorsport traditionally honours the most successful privateers from the previous season at the end of the year. The ‘Night of Trophies’ at BMW Group Classic in Munich (GER) on Friday saw the coveted trophies presented at a joint evening with BMW Motorrad Motorsport for the first time. Furthermore, the new BMW M2 CS Racing was also presented live to the customer teams and drivers from around the world. With 844 points to his name, Piana was top dog in the Drivers’ Competition during the 2018\/19 scoring period. He was rewarded for his efforts with a winner’s cheque for € 30,000. His team-mate, 16-year-old Marius Zug (GER), also picked up the trophy for the best young driver. In the Team Competition, Hofor Racing took victory for the first time. The 25 most successful drivers and the top ten teams shared a total prize purse of € 350,000. This season, 339 drivers and 71 teams were registered for the BMW Sports Trophy competitions. Roughly 200 guests joined BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt and Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, together with presenters Eve Scheer and Alexander Hofmann, as they started the evening by looking back on the highlights of the Customer Racing season. They included overall victory for Pixum Team Adrenalin Motorsport in the VLN Endurance Championship at the Nürburgring with the BMW M240i Racing, the Driver title in the GT4 European Series with the BMW M4 GT4, and overall victory in the Driver and Team competitions in the China GT Championship with the BMW M6 GT3. After that, the main participants on two and four wheels, who once again delivered many victories and titles in 2019, took turns on the stage. “Congratulations to Gabriele Piana and Hofor Racing on their overall victories in the BMW Sports Trophy,” said Marquardt. “Both Gabriele and Martin Kroll’s teams have been successfully entering our traditional Customer Racing competition for many years and regularly achieve great success in BMW race cars. As such, I am all the more delighted that they have now been rewarded for their efforts with first place in the BMW Sports Trophy. However, at BMW Motorsport we are also very proud of all the other participants. Every single top-ten result, every single podium, and every single race win is very valuable to us. I would like to thank all the drivers and teams, who have once again proved to be fantastic ambassadors for the BMW brand – regardless of which championship, which car, and which corner of the world they have been competing in.” Driven to the top by passion: Gabriele Piana and Hofor Racing.After finishing 15th last year, Piana made it to the very top of the overall standings this time. The 33-year-old finished well clear of Americans Johan Schwartz and Alec Udell. Piana contested the full season in ADAC GT4 Germany and the GT4 European Series in a BMW M4 GT4 for the RN Vision STS Racing team. He took eight class victories and scored a total of 844 points. “That would not have been possible without Marius, the team and all the people who support me,” said Piana. “We are a small team and we worked very well. It was not an easy season and we had some disappointments too. But that just makes me all the more delighted. I would like to thank the whole team, Marius and my family.” The Hofor Racing team was unbeatable in the BMW Sports Trophy Team Competition. With 1,076 points, the Swiss team finished ahead of Pixum Team Adrenalin Motorsport and Rooster Hall Racing in second and third place. As well as 25 podium finishes, Martin Kroll’s (SUI) team also won the team title in the 24h Series Champion of the Continents, the 24h Series European Championship, and ADAC GT4 Germany. As well as the trophy, Hofor Racing also picked up a winner’s cheque for € 30,000 for its victory in the BMW Sports Trophy Team Competition. \"We've been involved for ten years now and we have been working with Bonk Motorsport for the last two years“, said Martin Kroll. \"And we have managed to secure the BMW Sports Trophy title after these two years. That is a great feeling.\" Michael Bonk (GER), Team Principal of Bonk Motorsport, adds: \"We've already experienced the winning feeling as a team, but this is the first time we've won a title. When we joined forces, winning the team championship was one of our main objectives. But no-one expected it to happen quite so quickly.\" Zanardi honours exceptionally talented Marius Zug as “Rookie of the Year”.Marius Zug can also look back on an extraordinary debut season with BMW. At just 16 years of age, the youngster performed impressively alongside Piana. He claimed top-ten finishes in ten of twelve ADAC GT4 Germany races. He ended the season in second place, just six points off the lead, and also won the Junior competition. Zug also went up against some big names in the GT4 European Series and, despite taking five race wins, missed out on the Drivers’ title by a whisker. For those performances, he was named ‘Rookie of the Year’ by BMW works driver and Brand Ambassador Alessandro Zanardi (ITA). \"This award is a lovely way to end the year, even though the season didn't go perfectly”, said Zug. “This is my first event with BMW and I am really enjoying it.\" FIST-Team AAI produces the BMW Customer Racing ‘Moment of the Year’.After the ‘Win of the Year’ was awarded at last year’s BMW Motorsport end-of-season event, this year fans on BMW Motorsport social media channels had the opportunity to vote for their personal BMW Customer Racing ‘Moment of the Year’. They could choose between five highlights from the 2019 season. With 70 percent of the votes, victory went to FIST-Team AAI, which won both the Drivers’ and Team titles in this season’s China GT Championship. Champion driver Nick Yelloly (GBR) accepted the award on behalf of the team. The event concluded with another premiere, as the customer racing teams and drivers present were officially introduced to the new BMW M2 CS Racing for the first time. The new entry-level model from BMW M Motorsport not only boasts impressive driving performance, but also offers newcomers to motorsport the performance of a thoroughbred race car. Overview of the final results for the 2018\/19 BMW Sports Trophy. BMW Sports Trophy Driver Standings: PositionDriverPoints1Gabriele Piana8442Johan Schwartz7023Alec Udell6384Ricardo van der Ende6195Simon Knap6126Michael Fischer5367Michael Schrey4888Thomas Jäger4389Yannick Fübrich42310Christopher Rink37211Toby Grahovec36312Philipp Leisen36213Stefano Comandini35614Danny Brink35415Martin Kroll35416Torsten Kratz35417Oliver Söderström35418Oliver Frisse31219Andrew Jordan30220David Griessner29321Moran Gott28822Jukuchou Sunako27423Marko Radisic27024James Clay26925Takayuki Kinoshita258 BMW Sports Trophy Team Standings: PositionTeamPoints1Hofor Racing1,0762Pixum Team Adrenalin Motorsport1,0023Rooster Hall Racing9144Securtal Sorg Rennsport7925RN Vision STS Racing Team7576BimmerWorld Racing6887BMW Team Italia6048MDM Motorsport5859Classic BMW56910FIST-Team AAI508\n"}

The customer racing range of products in the BMW M Motorsport programme is getting a new top-of-the-range model. From the 2022 season, privateers and privateer teams around the world will have the opportunity to do battle for wins and titles in a GT3 model based on the next generation of the BMW M4. The BMW M4 GT3 will be the new top vehicle in the customer racing offering. The race car has been in development for several months and will undergo intensive testing next year. The BMW M4 GT3 will succeed the BMW M6 GT3, which has been in action around the world since 2016 and has brought home wins at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), the FIA GT World Cup in Macau (CHN) and in numerous international race series. The production model BMW M4, which forms the base for the BMW M4 GT3, is powered by a six-cylinder engine with BMW M TwinPower Turbo Technology that achieves more than 500 hp. The engine and chassis of the road vehicle are the perfect basis for the development of the GT3 racing version. With this goal in mind, the BMW M engineers built an engine – the S58 – that boasts impressive engine characteristics and explosive power delivery, the motorsport genes of which can also be experienced away from the racetrack at any time. “With our new GT3 project, we are emphasising the significance of BMW M Customer Racing. It is a central pillar of our motorsport programme,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “With the introduction of the new GT3 regulations for 2022, the BMW M4 is the perfect base. The core product from our colleagues at BMW M is yet again just great. Without wanting to give too much away, the BMW M4 GT3 will be a real highlight in terms of optics and technology. The term ‘icon’ is definitely appropriate here. We want to play a major role in international GT racing with the BMW M4 GT3, as its predecessor did at its victories at the 24-hour races in Spa-Francorchamps, at Macau and in many other race series around the world. Development is already at full speed. The rollout is planned for the second half of 2020.” Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH, said: “It is only logical that future top models in customer racing will be based on the next generation of the BMW M4. We will already be setting new standards in terms of sporting performance in production, which is why it makes sense to present the new GT3 sports car on this platform as well.” While the 2020 season will be one of development and testing, regular tests in race conditions are planned for 2021. Anyone interested in the BMW M4 GT3 should contact BMW Motorsport by email at: M4GT3@BMW-Motorsport.com.\n"}

Impressive premiere in the double-cone building at BMW Welt. On Thursday, BMW hosted its first major sim racing event in Munich (GER). BMW SIM LIVE 2019 saw ten of the best sim racers in the world go head to head with ten BMW works drivers, passionate BMW Motorsport fans, media representatives and influencers in exciting races. While victory in the Pro Race and a winner’s cheque for 10,000 Euros went to Mitchell deJong (USA) of VRS Coanda Simsport in the BMW M8 GTE, the Fan Race was won by Michi Hoyer (GER). BMW Motorsport and BMW M presented the BMW M2 CS Racing to the public for the first time, following which the future entry-level model in the BMW M Customer Racing range made its virtual racing debut. The newly-developed sim version of the BMW M2 CS Racing was used on the rFactor2 gaming platform for two races involving media representatives and fans who had qualified in advance via BMW Motorsport social media channels. This is the first time that a new BMW Motorsport race car has been presented in both real and virtual form at the same time. On Friday, the BMW M2 CS Racing will have its world premiere in front of customers. In the Pro Race and the Works Drivers’ Race, the participants took to the virtual track with the BMW M8 GTE on the iRacing platform. “That was a successful premiere for the BMW SIM LIVE end-of-year event,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “We witnessed great motorsport in today’s races and saw how much of a buzz BMW cars create on the virtual track too. The fact that we launched a real and a virtual race car – the BMW M2 CS Racing – simultaneously for the first time just goes to show how important the greater involvement in sim racing is to us. Simulation plays an increasingly important role at BMW Motorsport and in the BMW Group. Furthermore, with sim racing we are lowering the barriers that must be overcome to enter the world of motorsport. It is fantastic to be able to bring our works drivers together with sim pros, our fans and representatives of the media. This kind of thing is only possible in a virtual world.” Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand Experience, said: “Our vision is clear: As a premium automobile manufacturer with strong motorsport DNA, BMW wants to play the leading role in the field of sim racing. As a modern and innovative brand, we are also entering the world of virtual racing as a credible key player. Through this commitment, we want to impassion young target groups, like generation Y and Z, and let them be thrilled by the brand. I would like to thank iRacing, rFactor2 and Fanatec, who have all contributed to the successful premiere of BMW SIM LIVE.” The Pro Race at BMW SIM LIVE 2019 was especially exciting. The sim racers produced some thrilling battles with the BMW M8 GTE at ‘Daytona International Speedway’ in a race that showcased the high standard of their driving. DeJong crossed the finish line in first place, followed by Laurin Heinrich (GER, Williams eSports) and Maximilian Benecke (GER, Pure Racing Team) in second and third who received cheques over 5,000 and 2,500 Euros respectively. DeJong said: “The day was pretty awesome for me. We got to meet the factory drivers and all the other sim racers. It was a privilege to be here. And we had a really fun race to cap it off. It really went well for me – and it was really exciting.” Sim influencer Jimmy Broadbent (GBR) claimed victory in the Media Race, while Hoyer came first in the Fan Race. Note to editors: In our video “THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF BMW SIM”, BMW works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT), Maximilian Günther (GER) and Alexander Sims (GBR), sim racers Alexander Voß and Laurin Heinrich (both GER), and engineers from BMW Motorsport and BMW production development, reveal the importance of simulation.

I can well imagine a future in the DTM. I am looking for a new challenge, and the DTM is certainly just that. The series has a top-class field and the standard of driving is extremely high. However, we must first wait and see how I get on at the test.” “I’m really looking forward to take it to the track in the BMW M4 DTM again,” said Yelloly. “I know last year’s car from a previous test and I have to say that it is just such a great race car.

I’m very grateful to BMW Motorsport for giving me the opportunity and can’t wait to get behind the wheel.” The test at Jerez de la Frontera takes place from 10th to 13th December.\n"}

In preparation for the 2020 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has completed its first test of the winter at Jerez de la Frontera (ESP). The team, with riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and new addition Eugene Laverty (GBR), spent two days evaluating a host of new components for the BMW S 1000 RR on Thursday and Friday. The extensive test programme saw the team work on areas such as the chassis, electronics and ergonomics. Sykes and Laverty enjoyed good test conditions in dry and sunny weather. Laverty took to the track on the 2019 version of the RR on the first morning, in order to familiarise himself with the BMW Superbike. He then switched to the version for the 2020 season, complete with new components, in the afternoon. The team will now use the information gathered by Sykes and Laverty at the Jerez test, in order to continue the further development of the RR for the 2020 WorldSBK season. The next tests are scheduled for January, firstly at Jerez de la Frontera, then at Portimão (POR). The opening round of the 2020 season takes place from 28th February to 1st March on Phillip Island (AUS). Quotes after the test at Jerez de la Frontera. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Already during the final stages of the past season, we have been working intensively on the further development of the BMW S 1000 RR for 2020. Our first winter test in Jerez de la Frontera has been very productive. Among other things, we were able to test various chassis variants, new shock absorber elements, a range of tyre options, and electronic updates. Tom had a few minor issues at the start of day one, but they were resolved quickly and we were able to complete the busy programme, which included many test points. Eugene first had to find his feet on the RR, but was soon able to start to configure the bike to his own personal requirements. We are happy with the progress he has made at his first test with the RR. We must now analyse the large amount of data and comprehensive rider feedback we have received, which will help determine the direction we will take to start the 2020 season.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We’ve completed two full days of testing with Tom and Eugene; we got through an awful lot of work. We are generally pleased with the outcome. We’ve found a clear direction for Tom on his chassis set-up which lets us move forward in a specific direction we know he will be comfortable with. We worked through a big list so we’re really pleased for Tom. Eugene had to take some time to get used to the electronics package on the BMW S 1000 RR and over the Christmas break, we will further work on a strategy for him. He was getting quicker and quicker but only until the point where he was ready to push. But we are very still happy with his first test. He was running consistent times and we are satisfied with the progress. Overall, we are happy going into the break. We had no major issues and we get the bikes ready now and come back for the tests in January.” Tom Sykes: “Definitely I think we had a very strong test and credit to all the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. We had a big list to go through and they were working so hard. I am very satisfied with what we achieved. We really tried a lot on the BMW S 1000 RR, definitely made progress and for me now I can go into the winter feeling happy with our performance. Certainly on race tyres as well, we found quite a step and also over the distance. The bike was working nicely and we obviously tried the qualifying tyre at the end. It was incredible but after two strong sectors I unfortunately made a small mistake in the hairpin and crashed. But I was interested in how the bike feels with high grip and I also went for another lap after the crash. For me that was good because we have extra information going into the winter and the guys can keep working. So for me that was a good test with a consistent track to work through a very big list and that’s what we needed all season. Thanks to the whole team and the guys back at the factory for working so hard to make things possible. I think the decision to skip the Aragón test paid off because it was a very structured test and we worked very well.” Eugene Laverty: “Overall, it was a good test. I think I can tell I’ve got a bike with the best chassis I’ve ever ridden. The way the bike turns and enters the corner is incredible. It’s surprising just how physical it is to ride right now. We have to get the power under control for the corner exit. Once I can get that it will be even more rideable. Right now I can wrestle it for one lap if we wanted to get a lap time but it’s testing so it’s not necessary. So we’ve been working and just trying to tame the beast a little bit so we can get a bike that is going to be comfortable for 20 laps. The chassis is incredible and that’s the important thing. The base of the bike is good, now it’s just another fine-tuning of the electronics.” \n"}

For many years and often even decades, BMW has been collaborating with world-renowned orchestras in creating formats such as “BMW Opera Next” and “BMW Classics” to offer entirely novel ways to experience music. As a result, millions of visitors have enjoyed free concerts performed at the famous squares in select cities all over the world as well as on online platforms.In addition, the electrification of vehicles opens up entirely new possibilities at the crossroads of sound, music and mobility. In 2019, BMW partnered with internationally renowned film music composer and Academy Award winner Hans Zimmer to compose the electric drive sounds and sound signs for the BMW Vision M NEXT.Music is highly emotional and creates unforgettable moments. What is the potential hidden in this universal language? Developing new sounds continuously represents an incredible opportunity.To this end, BMW intends to also involve orchestras as part of the sonic exploration that will define sounds of the future and its international partners were thrilled at the prospects of this initiative.Sir Simon Rattle, Music Director of London Symphony Orchestra:“Each summer since 2012, London’s iconic Trafalgar Square plays host to the capital’s largest free open-air classical music concert, BMW Classics. Our shared mission in producing ‘BMW Classics’ is simple – to bring great music and the opportunity to participate in great culture to as many people as possible – and with this concert now being livestreamed on the orchestra’s YouTube channel, we can reach audiences all around the world. Every year we also present a brand new work by an emerging composer; without the support of BMW and the Mayor of London, commissioning a new piece and holding a free event of this sort would simply not be possible. The LSO is proud of our Principal Partnership with BMW and look forward to working together for many years to come.”Vladimir Urin, General Director of Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow:“We are very pleased that our long-standing friendship and partnership with BMW has been embodied in open-air concerts, which can be visited by residents and guests of Moscow. Now the Bolshoi Theatre has become part of this international initiative organized by BMW in the late twentieth century. Not only Berlin, London and Munich, but also Moscow are waiting for these summer concerts, thanks to which the widest public has the opportunity to listen to contemporary stars of the opera scene. This initiative is very much in line with the spirit of the Bolshoi and BMW, because we are always striving for new things - new technologies, new machines, premieres, young talents – and now attracting a new audience. And we are not ready to stop. This season we plan to reach new geographical boundaries of our capital.”Alexander Pereira, CEO and Artistic Director of Teatro alla Scala, Milan:“For the Teatro alla Scala, BMW is a strategic partner with whom we created numerous projects over the past years. We believe that the relationship between our cultural institution and BMW, as a company known the world over for its excellence, goes far beyond traditional sponsorship, it is a true partnership. Since 2014, BMW has been our main partner for the project ‘Opera For Kids’, offering over 200,000 children and their families the opportunity to visit Teatro alla Scala for the very first time. As a result, a number of these children took up playing instruments immediately following their visit. Teatro alla Scala is proud to collaborate with the department of Cultural Engagement at BMW in pursuing their mission to develop and promote the art of music.”Matthias Schulz, Artistic Director, and Daniel Barenboim, General Musical Director of Staatsoper Unter den Linden, Berlin:“It is our mission to ensure that the Staatsoper Unter den Linden is seen as a venue where people can experience something truly unique with all their senses. ‘State Opera for All’ has been hugely successful in creating exactly that for thirteen years! For that reason, we are all the more pleased about taking our next steps together with BMW as our main partner in launching our digital partnership. With ‘BMW Opera Next’ we will make use of the opportunities arising from digitalization and social media to open up new perspectives and become more accessible, specifically to inspire younger audiences.”Nikolaus Bachler, General Manager of Bayerische Staatsoper, Munich:“BMW has been our trusted partner for 24 years. It is a cooperation on equal footing, which in turn allows for an open exchange. The initiative ‘Opera for All’ would simply not be possible any other way. BMW fully understands how important access to music is – for all people – be it to classical music, jazz or pop.”Paul Müller, Executive Director, and Valery Gergiev, Music Director of Munich Philharmonics:“Music is not a static entity – it needs to prove itself again and again to each new generation. That demands strong partners offering a genuine exchange. BMW is such a partner – together, we develop ideas and promote novel approaches. Our initiative ‘Spielfeld Klassik’ illustrates beautifully how this collaboration ensures that we are well-positioned in the field of musical education for all ages.”BMW Group is also partner of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (USA) and Frieze Music in London and Los Angeles.

Countless battles, three safety car periods and a beaming birthday boy, Marco Wittmann (GER), was on the podium. Part two of the ‘SUPER GT x DTM Dream Race’, the first joint event held by the DTM and SUPER GT Championship on Japanese soil, delighted Fuji (JPN) fans on Sunday. Wittmann, celebrating his 30th birthday, battled his way to second place in the Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM. Kamui Kobayashi (JPN) also gave an action-packed display, as did Alessandro Zanardi (ITA), who found himself as high as second place at times in the ZF BMW M4 DTM. Kobayashi came home fifth, while Zanardi finished in 13th place. The safety car made three appearances over the course of the race. Fuji fans were not only treated to countless battles out on the track, but also the odd contact between cars and a few crashes. The action came thick and fast in the closing stages. Wittmann crossed the finish line in third place, but was then promoted to second place after Loïc Duval (FRA, Audi) received a one-second penalty for a previous incident. Victory went to Narain Karthikeyan (IND, Honda). Wittmann, whose family and many friends had travelled to Fuji, can now celebrate his 30th birthday in style in Tokyo (JPN). Before the race, BMW Group Motorsport Director, Jens Marquardt, fellow drivers Zanardi and Kobayashi, and the entire BMW Team RBM sang to him and presented him with a big birthday cake during the morning’s pit walk. Quotes after race one of the ‘SUPER GT x DTM Dream Race’ at Fuji. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director): “That is exactly the kind of race we wanted for our fans here in Japan – and, of course, for those watching in Europe. That was really great motorsport, although it was rather chaotic at times, but that is what the fans want to see. Our trip to Fuji was definitely worth the effort. Thank you to Bart Mampaey and everyone at BMW Team RBM. They all did a fantastic job, ensuring our three cars were running at the very highest level and performing great pit stops. Congratulations to Marco Wittmann – on his birthday, and second place here. That was another superb performance from him. Kamui Kobayashi also fought hard and put on a sensational display on his first weekend in a DTM car. Alex Zanardi was also in the thick of the action and once again produced some very special moments. All in all, it was a great advert for touring car racing. We saw that a joint event with SUPER GT and the DTM can work brilliantly and produce superb racing. The Dream Race was a total success – let’s do it again. On the whole, it has been a very successful weekend for us with Alexander Sims’ victory in Formula E and second place for the BMW M6 GT3 in the IGTC in Kyalami.” Bart Mampaey (Team Principal BMW Team RBM):“The races had a bit of everything: uncertainty with regard to the weather, safety cars, crashes, and a lot of battles. We adapted to the conditions and the circuit over the course of the weekend. We had a better package today. Marco Wittmann did an outstanding job, as did Kamui Kobayashi and Alex Zanardi. The strategy worked well with all three cars today. I think we can congratulate everyone who was involved in getting this event up and running and making it such a success. Motorsport is the big winner today. For the entire trip to Japan, preparing for the race, and then this result I have to say a big thank you to my team. As in the past, we showed again today that we feel at home on an international stage.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 7th, Race: 2nd):“I am delighted. When you consider how we started the weekend, we can be extremely happy with second place on Sunday. It was a crazy race, with many safety cars. However, somehow, we always seemed to have the right instinct and came away with a great result. This event was awesome. The Japanese fans are really enthusiastic and friendly. It was great fun. Now it is time to celebrate my birthday.” Kamui Kobayashi (#00 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 13th, Race: 5th):“It was a tough race. It was really wild out there at times. Compared to yesterday, we improved dramatically. The race was great fun and we battled hard. It was a great experience to work with BMW Team RBM. We met for the first time in Fuji this week, and soon gelled. We will take a lot of great memories away with us. Thank you very much, guys.” Alessandro Zanardi: (#4 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 22nd, Race: 13th):“I am sure that being in second place, on the front row, at the re-start means I will be in some nice photos….But seriously, I really enjoyed that race. I would like to thank BMW Team RBM for the fantastic job they did. It is not easy to transport three cars to Japan and get them ready to race. The car was very good over the full race distance today. I received a few nudges from the opposition, with the last one in particular causing some serious damage to my car. It was an eventful race. However, I was able to stay clear of all the problems and took my chances. The pace was good. I could hardly be happier.” \n"}

Having started the race from 16th position, Mikkel Jensen (DEN), Christian Krognes (NOR) and Nick Catsburg (NED), in the #34 BMW M6 GT3, concluded the 9 Hours of Kyalami (RSA) in second place. Martin Tomczyk (GER), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) had led the race until just before the finish, crossing the line in seventh place in the BMW Team Schnitzer #42 BMW M6 GT3. In the sister Walkenhorst Motorsport car, the #36 BMW M6 GT3, Michael Von Rooyen, Gennaro Bonafede (both RSA) and team principal Henry Walkenhorst (GER) secured victory in the AM category. The #34 squad had just missed out on the pole shootout the previous day and began the race from 16th place, but starting driver Jensen and then Catsburg set about a brilliant chase that took the #34 BMW M6 GT3 to second place before the third driver, Krognes, moved into the lead at the halfway point of the race. The #42 BMW M6 GT3, in which Tomczyk had started the race from eighth position, was also displaying some great pace at that point and was in a promising second place. The two BMW M6 GT3s were able to maintain their positions in the leading group. As had been the case on previous days, heavy rainfall set in two hours before the finish and led to an extended safety car period which saw Tomczyk take the lead in the #42 BMW M6 GT3 as other cars headed for the pits. Once the race restarted around 30 minutes from the end, however, the BMW Team Schnitzer car also had to make a pit stop, consequently falling back to tenth place. A strong performance in the final phase saw Farfus climb back up to seventh position. In the #34 BMW M6 GT3, Catsburg completed his final pit stop during the safety car period and moved up from fifth to second place during the final laps, allowing him to cross the line and claim the first podium finish of the season. There was also cause to celebrate for the sister Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M6 GT3. Von Rooyen, Bonafede and team principal Walkenhorst claimed victory in the #36 BMW M6 GT3 in the AM category. Before the race itself, BMW brought a piece of motorsport history back to life on the Kyalami circuit. Van der Linde drove some demonstration laps at the wheel of the legendary BMW 530 LME, thrilling spectators all around the circuit. The first race car based on the 5 series BMW dominated the Modified Production Series in the 1970s, celebrating three championship titles in a row. The BMW 530 LME was in race action in South Africa until 1985 and became the most successful racing car ever developed on the basis of a 5 series BMW. A version of the legendary homologation car restored by BMW South Africa was on show for a few demonstration laps at Kyalami. The limited special edition was produced exclusively at the BMW Plant in Rosslyn in the 1970s. Reactions to the 9 Hours of Kyalami: Rudolf Dittrich (General Manager BMW Motorsport Vehicle Development):“Throughout the season, we came close to a podium on a regular basis with the BMW M6 GT3 in the Intercontinental GT Challenge. The fact that we did it at the season finale at Kyalami makes it all the more rewarding. Congratulations to Nick Catsburg, Mikkel Jensen, Christian Krognes and the entire Walkenhorst team on the second place and the victory in the AM category. The race was a thriller, right to the very end, and it is great for us to be able to round off our return to South Africa with a podium finish. Congratulations are also in order for BMW Team Schnitzer, who put on a very good racing performance. Unfortunately, the strategy didn't work out for that car in the end. Many thanks as well to the numerous BMW fans at the circuit for their great support. They showed us once again just how important BMW is here in South Africa. Congratulations to Dennis Olsen for securing the drivers’ title, and to Porsche for winning the constructors’ championship.” Henry Walkenhorst (Walkenhorst Motorsport Team Principal):“That was a bit tricky. In fact, we had everything you could wish for. It was relatively warm, then it turned cold, it rained, the safety car came out. However, we are pleased with it overall. We didn't make any mistakes. We could also have competed in the Pro-Am category with our second BMW M6 GT3 and we would have won that too. We are very pleased with the result for both cars and with the performance of the whole team on this race weekend. That was a lovely way to round off a season that brought us plenty of bad luck.” Nick Catsburg (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, 2nd place):“That is pretty unbelievable after the result in qualifying. We didn't expect to get second place; it is just superb. Both of my team-mates did a fantastic job. Our pace was really good and we managed to drive at the front. That was a totally crazy finish. The car did really well in the rain and we were able to overtake a few cars. Second place is superb and I am delighted to have finished the season like that.” Mikkel Jensen (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, 2nd place):“After 16th place yesterday, there was no way we could have even dreamed of a result like this. I had a really good first stint and was able to move up from 16th to seventh place. Then Nicky took over and made it to second place. We got the strategy spot on and that put us right in the race. That was two hours before the finish. Then we managed to stay in front and just had to see it home. We ended up in second place but we could have finished first or fourth. All in all, we are very, very happy with this result.” Christian Krognes (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, 2nd place):“That was a real rollercoaster ride. One hour before the end of the race, I thought we'd finish tenth. We finished second thanks to some special circumstances. Nicky did a fantastic job at the end. We did not expect to be going so fast in the rain. Second place is just unbelievable.” Herbert Schnitzer jr. (BMW Team Schnitzer Team Principal):“Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Walkenhorst Motorsport team as they did a brilliant job. The whole team, the drivers, their strategy, how they behaved during the race, they just got it all perfectly right. It was difficult for us. The opening phase of the race was not ideal. We lost a few places in battles with other cars that were behind us. However, we were able to work our way up again towards the halfway point of the race. The rain really didn't help us very much though. Many thanks to the whole team for their great performance over the whole weekend.” Sheldon van der Linde (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer, 7th place):“There were plenty of ups and downs in changeable conditions. To be honest, that is not what you normally expect in South Africa. We had a good start and battled our way up through the field, but our strategy didn't quite pay off in the end. I would really like to thank BMW Team Schnitzer for making my home race so special. I hope to be back next year, as this was certainly one of my favourite races of the year.” Augusto Farfus (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer, 7th place):“Ultimately, that was a funny old race and it was more of a lottery. For a while, it looked like we were in with a chance of winning it. But then I lost some places and had to battle my way back. Twenty minutes before the finish, we were at the back of the field. I was able to move up to seventh place but that was the best I could do. I think that we deserved more but we just couldn't finish it off. At least the team's other car reached the podium. Overall, it’s been a great season with BMW and I would like to thank every single member of the team for that. We fought hard for it. Unfortunately, we didn't achieve what we were aiming for.” Martin Tomczyk: (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer, 7th place):“That was a pretty tough weekend. It didn't start too badly with the pole shootout, which got us sixth place on the grid. The challenging weather conditions that we had during the race did not make it easy at all. Nonetheless, things were going very well for us for a long time. We were at the front for a long time and we were challenging for a podium finish. Unfortunately, we didn't have much luck with our strategic decision and only managed to cross the line in seventh place.”\n"}

Two pole positions and one win was the fantastic result which BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver Alexander Sims (GBR) secured at the season opener of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Diriyah (KSA). In the second race, on Saturday, Sims celebrated a commanding victory from first place on the grid – the first in his Formula E career. With 35 points, Sims also took the lead in the driver’s standings. Maximilian Günther (GER) drove a magnificent recovery race from ninth on the grid and finished the race in second place, but a retrospective time penalty saw him drop down into 11th place. Günther overtook two of his rivals too early at the end of a safety car period, an action which saw him awarded a 24-second time penalty after the end of the race and podium ceremony, leaving him without points. In the team standings, BMW i Andretti Motorsport are in third place with 35 points. Reactions to race 2 of the Diriyah E-Prix: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“What a race for BMW i Andretti Motorsport; what a win for Alexander Sims. After the pole position on Saturday, we knew that our BMW iFE.20 and our drivers were definitely competitive at the start of Season 6 but we had no idea that another pole position and our second win in Formula E would follow. Congratulations to Alexander and everyone at BMW i Andretti Motorsport and BMW i, in the drivetrain department, and at BMW Motorsport in Munich – a great team effort. Congratulations to Maximilian as well, who can be proud of his performance, despite the penalty. He drove a perfect race, but then overtook slightly too early. After our experience from last season, we know that it’s now all about confirming our performance in the coming races. But today I was simply proud as I followed the performance of our team at a distance in Fuji. Formula E is a TechLab for the BMW Group. This double success shows how well we are doing here – both on and off the track.” Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport, team standings: 3rd place):“This is a fantastic success for all of us demonstrating an amazing team spirit – particularly after the disappointment that we experienced after yesterday’s race. Evidently, Alexander slept well and woke up a winner. He adapted superbly to the changed conditions with more grip on the track. He drove a very clever race, and the team did everything right in terms of tactics. Despite the retrospective penalty, kudos to Maximilian as well, who drove a fantastic defensive race. It’s great how he kept Lucas di Grassi in attack mode behind him. He is still very young and no doubt his time as a race winner in Formula E will come.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, qualifying result: 1st place, race result: 1st place, points: 35, driver standings: 1st place):“The feeling I had as I crossed the finish line was indescribable. It was a fantastic day. We had a smooth race today, and the BMW iFE.20 felt really great. We learned our lessons from the problems that we experienced yesterday. Many thanks to the team, who were with me through the difficult times last season. After the tests we knew that we had a strong car, but we never expected things to go as well here in Diriyah as they have. You can’t plan for something like this in such a hotly contested race series.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, qualifying result: 9th place, race result: 11th place, points: 0, driver standings: 18th place):“Naturally, it is tough to be awarded a penalty like that retrospectively. The situation at the restart after the safety car period was unclear and it was frantic. Stoffel Vandoorne obviously made a quick decision to drive into the attack zone, which saw me come into contact with him slightly and damage the front of my car. Also, I was already alongside him at that point, and from my perspective there was no turning back. The action was unfortunate and I had hoped that it would be okay. The race officials saw things differently. I have to accept this decision. What remains is the fact that I drove a strong race and have the speed to finish on the podium. I will build on this as the season progresses. Congratulations to Alexander on his win. It’s a huge success for the team. Many thanks to everyone who made this strong performance possible – both here at the track and at BMW in Munich.” The BMW i Safety Cars.BMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 6.

The first joint race of cars from the DTM and the SUPER GT Championship has taken place. On Saturday, BMW Team RBM contested the first of two ‘Super GT x DTM Dream Race’ events in front of the impressive backdrop of Mount Fuji (JPN). Local hero Kamui Kobayashi (JPN) in 14th place at the wheel of the BMW M4 DTM was the best-placed BMW driver. Marco Wittmann (GER, Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM) finished 18th, Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) in the ZF BMW M4 DTM retired with a technical issue. Victory went to Nick Cassidy (NZL, Lexus). Kobayashi made up numerous positions on the first lap and fought his way up into 12th. In his first race appearance at the wheel of the BMW M4 DTM, he was in 14th place when he ultimately saw the chequered flag. Wittmann pitted after the first lap to give him an advantage in the event of a safety car period. Shortly before the end of the race, the safety car did then come onto the track, but it was not possible for Wittmann to unlap himself after his second stop. He was thus unable to benefit from his fresh set of tyres. Reactions after race one of the ‘SUPER GT x DTM Dream Race’ at Fuji. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director): “After qualifying it was clear that it wasn’t going to be an easy race for us. We opted for an aggressive strategy with Marco Wittmann, which didn’t work out in the end. Kamui Kobayashi had a really strong first race at the wheel of a DTM car. We were unlucky with Alex Zanardi; an electrical issue forced him to retire from the race. The safety car brought the field closer together again slightly at the end, however, it was obvious that the Super GT cars were simply faster in the dry than we were. When the regulations for next year are finally merged, no doubt the racing will be even more exciting but we are really looking forward to the second race. It was fantastic to see the many fans here at the track. We are taking away some good insights for tomorrow and will really go for it.” Bart Mampaey (Team Principal BMW Team RBM):“We pitted early with Marco Wittmann, which would have paid off if he had been able to unlap himself and then do battle with fresh tyres in the pack. Unfortunately, that’s not what happened. We need to analyse the problem with Alex Zanardi’s car in detail but his race pace was impressive. Kamui Kobayashi’s race was characterised by tyre degradation. His opening lap was fantastic, and he moved up into 12th but then there was a great deal of tyre wear, which meant we had to bring him in early. Things were similar in the second stint. We learned a lot, and hopefully we will be able to build on this tomorrow.” Kamui Kobayashi (#00 Puma BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 18th, Race: 14th):“The race was fun. It was my first race with BMW, running on Hankook tyres. I enjoyed it a lot and in the beginning I thought it could be quite a good race but the tyre drop was pretty massive, so we unfortunately lost some positions. That is what we need to improve for tomorrow. I am looking forward to tomorrow.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 19th, Race: 18th):“So far this weekend, we haven’t quite had the pace in either the dry or the wet unfortunately. From 19th on the grid we had to take a bit of a gamble. Unfortunately, our strategy with the early stop didn’t pay off because the safety car came too late for that. The strategy would have worked if the safety car had come in during the early laps. The overall event has been a great experience so far; the Japanese fans are amazing. Now we are working hard to have more success on the sporting side tomorrow.” Alessandro Zanardi: (#4 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 22nd, Race: DNF):“It was bad luck. Something didn’t work properly anymore and the engine changed noise, I lost some power, I reported that to the pit and we decided that it was safer to park the car for today. But I am very encouraged by the fact that my pace was not bad at all and for sure that makes me optimistic for tomorrow. Overall, I’m reallying enjoy the Japan experience; it’s a wonderful country and the fans are just fantastic. It’s incredible how great they are to me and I really hope I can make them proud tomorrow with a good performance because that is really the best thank you I can express from the bottom of my heart.” \n"}

We must now put that into practice in the race.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20, qualifying result: 1st place, race result: 8th place, points: 7, driver standings: 7th place):“When you start from pole position, you are obviously hoping for more than eighth place. The early stages actually went pretty well, but I noticed relatively early on that I was having to use too much energy to keep the cars behind me at bay. We clearly did not have the same speed as our rivals over the full race distance. Unfortunately, we were then a little too conservative with our energy management in the final few laps, and I then lost a few places as a result of a tough but fair manoeuvre from Nick de Vries on the final lap. All in all, not a perfect day – and one that we must analyse looking ahead to tomorrow’s race.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20, qualifying result: 9th place, race result: 18th place, points: 0, driver standings: 18th place):“That was not a good start to the season. I was in the points for almost the entire race and was battling for position. Unfortunately, I was then given a penalty, which cost me a place in the top ten. These things happen in motor racing – and, fortunately, it was just one of many races this season. We will learn our lesson and try to improve tomorrow.” The BMW i Safety Cars.BMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 6.

The ‘SUPER GT x DTM Dream Race’ event has begun with the first test sessions being held at the ‘Fuji International Speedway’ (JPN). Before taking to the track in his #4 ZF BMW M4 DTM, Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) had already completed some laps around the circuit with his handcycle. ‘Fuji International Speedway’ will be the venue for the para-cycling competitions of the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic Games (JPN). Zanardi has a good chance of qualifying for the games. At the 2012 games in London (GBR) and 2016 in Rio de Janeiro (BRA), Zanardi won a total of four Paralympic gold medals and he is 12-time para-cycling world champion. Participation in the Tokyo games is his big target for 2020. Before the Dream Race event started, Zanardi had the opportunity to experience the circuit with his handcycle and gather first information of what to expect at a possible start at the ‘Fuji International Speedway’. “Now I have a very good idea of what I have to prepare for,” said Zanardi. “I’ll bring home important information that will help me to prepare both technically speaking, because I am planning to develop a new bicycle, and also physically speaking. Each track has its own requirements and you can adapt your training procedure to the different courses you are going to race on. It is going to be a very interesting event. The track is beautiful but really hard. You never have a flat section, you are always either climbing or descending and I think it will also take some skill as far as approaching the turns because there are many areas where you have to brake hard and to steer in in the right moment with the right line. So I hope that my driving skill will help me a bit in those sections but there is a lot of work to do because this scenario is quite different to the ones on which we have competed up to this point. It is exciting and I am very grateful to BMW for offering me this opportunity, for sure mainly for the wonderful BMW M4 DTM I am going to be driving over the weekend, but also for this reason.” Now, Zanardi is fully focused on his appearance in the ZF BMW M4 DTM. On Friday, the free practice sessions for the Dream Race will be held, while for each Saturday and Sunday, one qualifying and one race are scheduled. Zanardi forms the BMW M Motorsport ‘Dream Team’ with Marco Wittmann (GER) and Kamui Kobayashi (JPN).\n"}

The fifth race on the fifth continent draws the Intercontinental GT Challenge (IGTC) season to a close this weekend. At the legendary track in Kyalami (RSA), BMW Team Schnitzer is set to compete with a BMW M6 GT3 and will send a local hero, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), to do battle. With the second race within a week, BMW Team Schnitzer master a huge organisational challenge, which was preceded by long and complex planning. In addition to the team from Freilassing, Walkenhorst Motorsport will also be competing in South Africa. Henry Walkenhorst’s (GER) team will field two BMW M6 GT3 at the IGTC season finale.As throughout the entire season, the Walkenhorst Motorsport team will compete with the #34 BMW M6 GT3 and the three regular drivers Nick Catsburg (NED), Mikkel Jensen (DEN) and Christian Krognes (NOR). In addition, the team will race with another BMW M6 GT3. Michael Von Rooyen, Gennaro Bonafede (both RSA) and team principal Henry Walkenhorst himself will take it in turns at the wheel of the #36 BMW M6 GT3.The cockpit of the #42 BMW M6 GT3 of BMW Team Schnitzer will be shared by Martin Tomczyk (GER), local hero Sheldon van der Linde, who contested the DTM for BMW in 2019, and Augusto Farfus (BRA). The nine-hour race in South Africa will be Farfus’ and BMW Team Schnitzer’s second race within a matter of days. Just last weekend the Brazilian was in action in the #42 BMW M6 GT3 at the FIA GT World Cup in Macau (CHN). There he took fourth place both in the qualifying race on Saturday and in the main race on Sunday.BMW Team Schnitzer master huge logistical challenge.The two races within a matter of days pose an enormous challenge not only for the Brazilian. BMW Team Schnitzer has accomplished a logistical tour de force with the organisation of the two race appearances, which was preceded by complex planning.At the FIA GT World Cup in Macau last weekend, the same BMW M6 GT3 that contested the ninth round of the VLN Endurance Championship Nürburgring (GER) was in action. The team only had a week to modify the BMW M6 GT3 after its appearance in the Eifel region, apply foils and deliver the car to Luxembourg. From there, the GT3 car was transported to Macau by aeroplane. Tools, spare parts and other equipment were transported from Europe to Asia by sea at the same time.A total of nine team members from the Schnitzer crew were on duty in Macau. While three of them remained there to load the containers, the others travelled to Johannesburg (RSA), around 11,000 kilometres away, on Monday morning. After about 14 hours in the air, they were received by seven other BMW Team Schnitzer employees in Kyalami, who had travelled to Kyalami the previous week to prepare the car and the equipment for the IGTC race weekend. The BMW M6 GT3 that contested the 10 Hours of Suzuka (JPN) will also take on this race.BMW Team Schnitzer started planning for the race weekend at the start of the year. They not only had to consider the availabilities of the cars and organisation of the freight, but also the greater personnel effort required by an endurance race. More pit stops and more tyres mean a need for more personnel than last weekend in Macau. On top of this are the special conditions at the track at every IGTC location.BMW and South Africa: a special relationship.After stopping off on four continents, in Bathurst (AUS), Laguna Seca (USA), Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) and Suzuka, already this year, the IGTC is breaking new ground in Kyalami. The series is hosting its first ever race on the African continent. It gets underway on Saturday, 23rd November at 12:00 (CET).BMW has a special relationship with the former Formula 1 track. In the final Formula 1 race of the 1983 season, Nelson Piquet (BRA) clinched the world championship title on the track in the province of Gauteng. This was also the first Formula 1 title for BMW and the first for a car with turbo drive.And it’s not only in motorsport that BMW enjoys a close relationship with South Africa. The plant in Rosslyn, located only around 60 kilometres away from Kyalami, was in 1973 the first plant that the BMW Group established outside Germany. Over 35 years and five generations, more than a million units of BMW 3 Series have been produced here. After a major investment the plant has been upgraded to produce the BMW X3 from 2018. BMW South Africa employs more than 40,000 employees directly and indirectly, and is one of the country’s leading exporters of cars.Sheldon van der Linde (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer):“I’m full of high expectations ahead of Kyalami. For the first time in my career, I will contest a race in front of my home crowd. This makes me even more motivated to put in a good performance. We have a really good package for the race, and I think the track is suited to the car. I used to live near the track. Since I will be staying with my parents for the race weekend, I will be waking up in my own bed and driving to the track before a race for the first time since I was involved in karting. That feels very special to me. Just recently, I drove on the track at the BMW M Festival in South Africa in the DTM race taxi, and I completed test drives here a few years ago. However, I’m not expecting this to give me a great advantage compared with other drivers who have never driven here before. For me, the racetrack is one of the best in the world. The surface and the layout are new, and the surrounding area on the outskirts of Johannesburg is unique. From my perspective, there is no better place to hold the season finale of the IGTC.”Augusto Farfus (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer):“After the race in Macau, this will be the second event within a week for me and the whole BMW Team Schnitzer. Naturally, this is a major challenge for us all. The tracks and the approaches in the two races are totally different. Macau was a sprint race, which was all about going on the attack. Whereas Kyalami will be an endurance race. On the other hand, it definitely has advantages contesting a race with the same car and the same tyres two weekends in a row. In Kyalami, we are all breaking new ground and are starting at a similar level. It’s been a long time since I was last in South Africa, but I only have good memories of the country and I am really looking forward to it. I think that we had a strong package, recently in Suzuka and throughout the entire season, but as yet have not been rewarded with a spot on the podium. So, I hope that we will make up for this at the season finale and end the year on a high.”Nick Catsburg (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport):“We haven’t competed in Kyalami yet, so it’s quite difficult to make a prediction. Personally, I have never been to South Africa before. So it’s an event with plenty of firsts. I have heard that the tyre wear is meant to be very low there, which I think should suit us. We have been very competitive throughout the season and I hope that this will also be the case in Kyalami and that we will be able to be up there battling for the podium. Even though we were a little unlucky in part, I really enjoyed the first season in the IGTC. The tracks and locations where we have raced have been very special. And being given the privilege of representing the Walkenhorst Motorsport team was a great experience. Now, I am hoping for a positive end to the season.”\n"}

The new MINI John Cooper Works GP is the fastest model of the British brand that has ever been approved for road use. A 225 kW\/306 hp 4-cylinder turbocharged engine accelerates the two-seater model – based on the MINI 3 door – from zero to 100 km\/h in just 5.2 seconds. The new MINI John Cooper Works GP will be presented to the public for the first time at the Los Angeles Auto Show . Intelligent lightweight construction goes hand in hand with the sustainable use of resources. The raw material for the outer shells, which are made of a particularly lightweight CFRP fleece, is a refined material that is recycled from the production of the BMW i3 and the BMW i8. The four CFRP components required for each individual vehicle are produced using a shared wet-pressing tool. In this way, a highly efficient production process can be applied that was previously only implemented in high-volume production. In addition, the wheel arch covers with their hexagonally sewn CFRP structure, double matt finish and consecutive numbering give each of the 3,000 vehicles produced a unique visual highlight. The new MINI John Cooper Works GP is the BMW Group's first production vehicle to feature an exposed matt CFRP coating. The individual numbering with the numbers “0001” to “3000” is applied to the surfaces of the front wheel arch panels by means of a newly developed paint transfer process.Model-specific design accentuations signal purist sporty flair.The purist character of the new MINI John Cooper Works GP, geared towards maximum performance, is further underscored by precisely deployed designed accentuations. Only the exclusive finish Racing Grey metallic is available for the exterior paintwork. Meanwhile the roof and exterior mirror caps are finished in the contrasting colour of Melting Silver metallic. Just like the front apron, the rear apron with integrated rear fog lamps has a distinctive shaping. A cross-member on the hexagonal radiator grille, the inserts in the lower air intake and the inside of the roof spoiler are finished in high-gloss Chili Red. Meanwhile the GP logos on the front and rear, the outer sides of the roof spoiler and the door sill finishers, as well as the foils above the side skirts, are finished with a stylised “GP” in Rosso Red metallic matt.A striking contrast here is provided by the black finish of the headlamp surrounds, the central radiator grille and rear lights, the fuel filler flap and the door handles, as well as the inlay on the bonnet and the MINI logo at the front and rear of the vehicle. The black inlays on the headlamps and the maximally darkened Union Jack rear light units likewise emphasise the uncompromising sporty flair of the new MINI John Cooper Works GP.Sports car cockpit with two seats and reduced acoustic insulation.Two seats and reduced acoustic insulation for the purpose of weight optimisation also give the interior of the new MINI John Cooper Works GP genuine sports car flair. The standard equipment includes John Cooper Works sports seats in Dinamica\/leather combination with silver side edges, red accentuation seams, a GP badge underneath the integrated headrests and red belt straps. The interior trim on the passenger side bears the numbering of the respective vehicle. This is produced individually for each one of the 3,000 extreme athletes by means of 3D printing.The model-specific John Cooper Works leather steering wheel also acquires its exclusive character from accentuations produced using the 3D printing process. In addition to red accentuation seams, the steering wheel rim made of soft nappa leather also features a metal centre marking for the 12 o'clock position created using the additive manufacturing process. The shift paddles on the steering wheel are likewise 3D-printed in metal. In addition to the GP logo, a characteristic honeycomb structure can be seen on the paddle surfaces. Colour accentuations in the otherwise dark cockpit are provided by the red GP logos on the floor mats, matching double stripes on the gear selector and the Chili Red painted aluminium cross-brace behind the seats. This serves as a shield to prevent luggage items from slipping forward in the event of sudden braking.Digital instrument cluster and central instrument with model-specific displays.Optional features for the new MINI John Cooper Works GP include automatic climate control, the Connected Navigation Plus package, which also includes telephony with wireless charging, and an alarm system. The Connected Media system comes as standard: it displays model-specific information on the 6.5-inch screen in the central instrument panel. The standard trim also includes a digital instrument cluster on the steering column. The high-resolution 5-inch colour screen shows the road speed both numerically and on a scale. The model-specific display includes temporary feedback and permanent display after activation of GP mode. A GP logo is permanently shown at the top of the screen. The graphic animation before vehicle start shows a model-specific image including the GP logo.Note: All figures relating to driving performance, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are provisional.\n"}

Quotes ahead of the Diriyah E-Prix: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“As the team heads back to the venue of its debut win in Season 5, and following a successful Valencia pre-season test, there is obviously some excitement ahead of the race weekend in Diriyah. However, we know that all of our competitors have been working hard and therefore we don’t underestimate the challenge ahead of us. Both Alexander and Maximilian have been very focused on their preparations for the first races of the season. With the new sporting regulations impacting how the energy is used during a race incident, we should see a move back to more energy limited racing. This should showcase the efficiencies of the BMW drivetrain. The double header format of the opening event always makes it slightly more challenging, but it is a very experienced crew at BMW i Andretti Motorsport that is well prepared for this challenge.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20):“I’m glad that the waiting for the season-opener is over now. After a lot of intensive testing we feel well prepared for Diriyah. Last season we got off to a great start there, so let’s hope for a good weekend. The track in Diriyah is a mixture of two different characters. The first section reminds me a bit of the mountain section in Macau: very demanding corners, very narrow streets. Then you have the second part which is pretty wide and straight with harder braking zones. That’s a really good combination.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20):“I’m really looking forward to contesting my first races for BMW i Andretti Motorsport after all the preparation. We completed our test programme without any major problems and should be well positioned. We will only see where we really stand at the season opener. I really enjoy the track in Diriyah. It goes up and down, and there are a lot of fast turns. The key to a fast lap time is in the winding middle sector. There is a good opportunity to overtake on the back straight.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race.

The trajectory of Zac Langdon-Pole’s BMW Art Journey, titled “Sutures of the Sky”, took him back in time by exploring how people have mapped the stars throughout history. Long before the compass and the sextant, it was skillful observation of migratory birds and following the stars which allowed Polynesian voyagers to navigate great distances all across the Pacific Ocean. With his focus on celestial mapping, from Europe to the Pacific Islands, Langdon-Pole sought to trace how Western forms of mapping have interacted with perspectives from the Pacific region.“The BMW Art Journey allowed me to research the idea of time and navigation as well as how humans have tried to map their place in the universe over the millennia. I was compelled by the idea that something as lofty and laden with awe as the stars could be a useful lens through which to explore more human and planetary truths. An important realization for me on this journey has been to see multiple forms of mapping in relation to one another. This is how richer, more complex stories and relationships to a place can be formed”, states Zac Langdon-Pole reflecting on his travels.Weaving through Western Europe, and the Pacific islands of Hawai’i, the Marshall Islands, Samoa and New Zealand from December 2018 to March 2019, his BMW Art Journey sought to understand how culture intersects with the science of celestial mapping, and consequently how it transcends into larger existential inquiries about our identities and our location in this increasingly globalized world. From London, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Dordrecht to Paris, Montignac, and Marseille the first leg of Langdon-Pole’s journey provided a site for preliminary research on early printed star charts and representations of celestial mapping between different regions. In London, the artist visited the Royal Academy’s “Oceania” exhibition, including works by indigenous artists and craftsmen spanning 500 years that demonstrate the astounding mobility of people in the Pacific Islands throughout history. In France Langdon-Pole viewed a prehistoric map of the night sky situated within the Lascaux caves near Montignac. It dates back at least 16,500 years, depicting star constellations that were believed to keep track of astronomical events. The research and travel during this leg of the BMW Art Journey examined how the star systems of the Southern Hemisphere were imagined from a European perspective across various historical periods.The second leg of the artist’s journey kicked off in Hawai’i, where the artist visited Mauna Kea and Honolulu. The Mauna Kea Observatories, located at the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawai’i, offered Langdon-Pole the opportunity to explore the presence and mediated dominance of Western astronomy as a starting point in the Pacific Ocean. While these observatories represent the pinnacle of scientific and technological engagement with the stars, the artist explored how their presence is entwined with fraught opposition by indigenous Hawaiians.Furthermore, Langdon-Pole traveled to the Marshall Islands to meet with Alson Kelen of the organization Waan Aelõñ in Majel (Canoes of the Marshall Islands) (WAM) on the atoll of Majuro. In doing so the artist aimed to learn how connections to these past traditions can tie to the future of these islands in the context of rising sea levels. Amongst delving into star navigation methods of the region, the artist also researched the Mattang, Meddo and Rebbelib ‘stick charts’ that map the wave currents and ocean swells throughout the 34 islands and atolls of the Marshall Islands archipelago.Before heading back to New Zealand to conduct further research and consolidate his work, Langdon-Pole visited the island of Upolu and Apia in Samoa. He travelled together with Samoan-New Zealand artist and composer Michael Lee to learn about the traditions of celestial navigation songs.Zac Langdon-Pole at Art Basel in Miami Beach 2019Zac Langdon-Pole will be on the ground at Art Basel in Miami Beach to present new artwork at the BMW Lounge. The presentation will debut a new body of work that stems directly from his research on the BMW Art Journey. Throughout his travels Langdon-Pole collected small samples of sand from specified locations. Then, using an analogue photographic method in a darkroom, he utilized these samples to make photograms of sand from each specified location. Sand is a material with deeply metaphorical associations—from being an analogy for time, as with an hour-glass, to the infinite, as in Jorge Luis Borges’s short story “TheBook of Sand”, to loss and entropy, as in Paul Celan’s poetry collection, “The Sand from the Urns”.In a wider context, Langdon-Pole considers these works as lyrical documents of sites threatened by the prevailing forces of climate breakdown: the erosion of shorelines and the desertification of landscapes. Resembling a view of a starry night-sky, complete with data on the date and place each sand sample was collected, Langdon-Pole’s sand photograms extend the aphorism ‘as above so below’ towards speculative futures of our planet’s changing climate.Also presented will be a piece by Langdon-Pole entitled “Orbits” .BMW is a global partner of Art Basel and has supported Art Basel’s three shows in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong Kong for many years.\n"}
{"prompt":"With the first purely electrically powered model for the premium mid-range, BMW is transferring the brand's characteristic core features to the age of locally emissions-free mobility – Fifth-generation BMW eDrive to be introduced for the first time in the BMW iX3 in 2020 and will also be used in the BMW iNEXT and the BMW i4 in 2021 – Advanced battery cell technology enables sporty performance and a range of around 600 kilometres in the BMW i4. ->","completion":" Munich. The heart of the BMW brand beats in the premium segment of the mid-range category. Along with the BMW 4 Series Coupé, BMW 4 Series Convertible and BMW 4 Series Gran Coupé models, it is the BMW 3 Series that brings out the qualities that are key to hallmark brand driving pleasure in a particularly concentrated form. Now BMW is transferring the brand's characteristic core features to the age of electric mobility – the central purpose in developing the BMW i4. The BMW Group's first purely electrically powered model for the premium mid-range combines driving dynamics, sporty and elegant design, premium quality and the spacious comfort and functionality of a four-door Gran Coupé with locally emissions-free mobility. This heralds a new era of driving pleasure.The future of electric mobility will be shaped by fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, for which the BMW iX3 – to be produced from 2020 onwards – will act as a pioneer, followed by the BMW iNEXT and the BMW i4. With fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology, which also includes the latest innovations in the field of battery cells, the BMW i4 sets new standards in sporty performance, achieving a range of some 600 kilometres.The development of the BMW i4 is part of a comprehensive product offensive by the BMW Group in the field of models with electrified drive. The company currently has the biggest range of all-electric and plug-in hybrid models within the competitive field. By 2023, the BMW Group will have 25 models with electrified drive in its program. With a model portfolio that includes efficient combustion engines as well as modern plug-in hybrid and purely electric drive, the BMW Group as a globally operating company is taking into account the varying requirements and preferences of its customers in different regions of the world. Irrespective of the type of drive selected, all current and future models feature hallmark brand driving pleasure as part of their specific characteristics.Fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology for optimised dynamics, efficiency and range.The drive technology of the BMW i4 sets new standards in terms of power density, efficiency and range in locally emissions-free driving. The electric motor, power electronics, charging unit and high-voltage battery have been entirely newly developed. Together they form the BMW eDrive technology of the fifth generation, with which the BMW Group has made further significant advancements in the field of electrified drive. From 2020 onwards, fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology will be introduced first in the BMW iX3 and then in the BMW iNEXT and BMW i4. The electric motor developed for the BMW i4 delivers a maximum output of around 390 kW\/530 hp, reaching the level of a V8 engine in current BMW models fitted with a combustion engine. Its spontaneous power delivery gives the BMW i4 outstanding performance characteristics and exceptionally high efficiency.The fifth generation of BMW eDrive also includes a newly designed high-voltage battery featuring the latest battery cell technology. The design of the high-voltage battery developed for the BMW i4 is characterised by its extremely flat design and optimised energy density. With a weight of some 550 kilograms, it has an energy content of around 80 kWh. This gives the BMW i4 a range of approximately 600 kilometres.Gran Coupé with characteristic design and performance features.The all-electric BMW i4 will be produced from 2021 onwards and subsequently launched on the global automotive markets. The new model will be manufactured at the company's main plant in Munich, where other vehicles produced include the BMW 3 Series Sedan with conventional combustion engine and plug-in hybrid drive, the BMW 3 Series Touring with conventional drive and from summer 2020 also with plug-in hybrid drive, the BMW 4 Series Coupé and the BMW M4 Coupé In addition to the sporty, elegant design that is typical of a 4-door coupé of the brand, the BMW i4 is characterised by impressive performance features. The BMW i brand's first Gran Coupé accelerates from zero to 100 km\/h in around 4.0 seconds, achieving a top speed of more than 200 km\/h.A flexible vehicle architecture, the flat, low-positioned high-voltage battery and the compact drive technology create a high degree of freedom in realising a model-specific design. The BMW i4 combines the characteristic proportions of a 4-door coupé with the typical design features of a BMW i model. Dynamically stretched lines and a precise surface design go hand in hand with aerodynamically optimised exterior features as well as sustainability accentuations that are specific to BMW i. High entry and exit comfort for the rear passengers and a spacious, variable interior ensure high suitability for both day-to-day trips and long-distance travel. As such, the BMW i4 can be clearly identified as a BMW Gran Coupé – and equally clearly as an electrically powered vehicle.Modular, flexible drive and battery storage technology.The electric drive component of the BMW i4, its charging unit and high-voltage battery are all developed in-house by the BMW Group. Production is carried out in-house or according to BMW Group specifications. Here, the experience gained from development of the previous generations of BMW eDrive technology is consistently tapped into with the aim of optimising all components on an ongoing basis.The BMW Group's comprehensive expertise in the field of electrified drive systems forms the basis for a scalable modular system whose components can be integrated into different vehicle concepts with great flexibility. Fifth-generation BMW eDrive technology comprises a highly integrated drive system in which the electric motor, transmission and power electronics are accommodated in a single housing. This drive system is compatible with all vehicle concepts and will be available for different models in a range of output levels. The highly integrated design of the system allows a significant increase in power density as well as a reduction in weight and manufacturing effort. Production of future-generation electric motors will no longer require materials categorised as rare earths.The next generation charging unit is characterised by a uniform package suitable for all future vehicle architectures. It can be used in plug-in hybrid models as well as in purely electrically powered vehicles and is designed for a charging capacity of up to 150 kW. This allows the high-voltage battery of the BMW i4 to be charged to around 80 per cent of its full energy content in around 35 minutes. This results in a charging time of around six minutes for a range of 100 kilometres.In the field of high-voltage batteries, too, the advancements introduced with the fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology are based on the BMW Group's in-depth expertise and years of experience. The company has an exceptionally high level of know-how both in the field of battery cell technology and in the manufacture of model-specific high-voltage batteries. This lays the foundation for continuous optimisation of the batteries – both in future plug-in hybrid models and in purely electrically powered vehicles. The BMW Group has been manufacturing modules and model-specific high-voltage batteries for vehicles with electrified drive systems since 2013. An independently developed modular system with a flexible arrangement of the modules enables integration of batteries developed in-house into various vehicle concepts. Consistent ongoing development work is dedicated to optimising the basic characteristics of the battery cells as well as the structure of the modules and their arrangement in the respective model-specific storage unit. For example, the batteries used in the BMW i4 and other future electric vehicles have a higher number of cells per module, a reduced number of components, a more compact design and increased flexibility with regard to their geometry.With the establishment of the Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich, the BMW Group has further expanded its research and development expertise in this area, which is crucial to the future of electromobility. The focus is on fundamental research in areas where there is an impact on customer-related factors such as energy density, accessible peak output, service life, safety, charging characteristics, response at different temperatures and manufacturing costs. At the new Battery Cell Competence Centre, research is being conducted in particular into the potential for further optimisation of cell chemistry and cell design. The selection and composition of materials for the anode, cathode, electrolyte and separator as well as the format of the battery cells made of these materials will have a key impact on the quality of high-voltage batteries used in future models with electrified propulsion.\n"}

Peter Hickman (GBR) dominated the race weekend in Macau (CHN) on his new BMW S 1000 RR – however, the second red flag of the race prevented him from potentially adding another Macau victory to his collection. The 53rd staging of the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix at the famous ‘Guia Circuit’ was red-flagged twice before eventually being abandoned. Hickman was classified second in the final result. Victory went to his MGM by Bathams team-mate Michael Rutter (GBR \/ Honda). In the last four years, Hickman has won the iconic Motorcycle Grand Prix on the narrow streets of Macau three time: in 2015, 2016 and 2018. This year, he was making his first appearance in Macau on the new BMW S 1000 RR and was looking good to claim victory number four. Hickman set the fastest time in practice, secured pole position and also set the pace in the warm-up. When the race got underway on Saturday afternoon (local time), pole-sitter Hickman stormed clear of the field, opening up a lead of seven seconds over second-placed Rutter. However, the race was red-flagged for the first time on lap four. Rutter got away best at the re-start and took the lead ahead of Hickman. Hickman hit back on the second lap after the re-start, passing Rutter to regain the lead. Shortly after that, however, a crash involving several riders caused the race to be red-flagged for the second time. Race control decided to abandon the race. The running order at the end of the first lap after the re-start was taken as the final result making Rutter, who was leading at that point, the race winner. Hickman was second. “I’m not surprised by the results. The rules here state that after a second red flag they declare a result regardless of how many laps have been completed and Michael led the opening lap, so he gets the win. Obviously right now all thoughts are with the riders involved in today’s incidents” Hickman said afterwards and added: “The bike was mega! Huge thanks to Bathams Racing and the continued support of Smiths Racing alongside all my incredible sponsors and fans.” In total, six BMW riders were classified in the top ten in the final result.

We needed a good start to immediately make progress through the field. However, the Porsche drivers were clever and managed to stay in front of me. After that, it was tough for me to match the pace of the front-runners. I took a bit more of a risk at the re-start after the safety car period and was able to briefly take third place. However, I then braked a little too late coming into Lisboa, and found myself back in fourth as a result. It would have been tough to keep Earl Bamber behind me for the rest of the race anyway. If somebody had told me after the first practice sessions that we would finish fourth here, I would have taken that straight away. As it stands, we are a little disappointed now. You always want to make it onto the podium. Despite that, we can be proud of our performance. I would like to thank the whole team at BMW Team Schnitzer. We now move on to Kyalami.“ Herbert Schnitzer jr. (Team Manager BMW Team Schnitzer): “The start went as we had expected; the Porsche drivers were clever. Over the course of the race, we saw that we did not quite have the performance of the leading group this weekend. However, Augusto certainly produced a great display. The qualification race, in particular, was fantastic.” Joel Eriksson (#91 BMW M6 GT3, 7th place): “I am pretty happy. That was pretty much the best we could have hoped for this weekend. My pace was good in today’s race. This was my first race weekend with a GT car in Macau, and I was close to Augusto’s level. I obviously still have some learning to do in a GT car here, but on the whole it has been a positive experience.” Jun-San Chen (Team Principal FIST-Team AAI): “We may not have made it onto the podium, but we can be very happy with the result.

Perhaps luck will play a role again, as it did at Le Castellet.” “I would like to thank Werner and the team for the opportunity to race at Sepang,” said Reiterberger. “I am already really looking forward to Sepang. It is an excellent circuit and I was on for my best result in the Superbike World Championship there in 2016. I was running a safe fourth until shortly before the finish, when I had to retire due to a technical issue. With that in mind, I have fond memories of Sepang. The track offers plenty of grip and I think we are well-placed to do well with our bike. I have two strong team-mates and together we will do everything we can to get a top result.” The team will continue its preparations with another test in Sepang in the week before the 8-hour race. \n"}
{"prompt":"Electric mobility in tomorrow’s world – a question of give and take.  Green light for the Bidirectional Charging Management (BCM) consortium research project led by the BMW Group: electric vehicles enable more efficient use of green energy while also boosting power supply reliability. ->","completion":" Munich. The newly launched Bidirectional Charging Management – BCM research project brings together companies and institutions from the automotive, energy and scientific sectors. They have teamed up to develop technological solutions for making electric mobility even easier and cheaper for users, with even lower emissions. By adopting a holistic approach, the project’s interdisciplinary partners are aiming to interlink vehicles, charging infrastructure and power grids for the first time in a way that facilitates the widest possible use of renewable energy – and at the same time increase power supply reliability. The research project will run for three years under the aegis of the German Aerospace Centre and with funding from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. Testing of the first 50 BMW i3 cars equipped with bidirectional charging technology (i.e. that are capable of backfeeding) is expected to start under real-world everyday conditions in early 2021.Not only will electric vehicles with bidirectional charging capability be able to draw electrical power for their high-voltage battery when plugged into a compatible charging station or wallbox, they will also have the ability to reverse the process and feed energy back into the power grid. This will effectively turn the electric vehicles’ batteries into mobile energy storage devices that can also supply electricity when required. Integrating as many electric vehicles as possible into the power grid in this way calls for myriad innovations in terms of vehicle technology, charging hardware, charging management, communication interfaces with energy sector stakeholders and legal parameters. Bringing about these advances is the task of the research project, in which the BMW Group is acting as consortium leader. It is joined by KOSTAL Industrie Elektrik GmbH (development of charging hardware), transmission network operator TenneT and distribution network operator Bayernwerk Netz GmbH (both energy system services), the Research Institute for Energy (FfE) and Research Association for Energy (both energy system analysis), the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT; research into electricity market and grid repercussions) and the University of Passau (user research).Expanding electric mobility enhances power supply reliability.Although the fleet of electric vehicles on our roads keeps growing, this only results in a slight increase in the amount of electric power required. However, there is a growing need to control energy flows intelligently in order to make optimum use of electricity from renewable sources. The BMW Group has already succeeded in implementing methods of intelligent charging control in pilot projects. For several years, intelligent charging management to meet the needs of both the customer and the power grid has been undergoing practical trials in everyday conditions in California with a fleet of 300+ electric vehicles. This has paved the way for the BMW Group to team up with power grid operator TenneT to develop an innovative solution in Germany that allows the charging strategy for electric vehicles to factor in the customer’s mobility schedule, the availability of green electricity and the current load on the power grid. It means plugged-in vehicles can suspend and later resume charging when prompted by signals from the grid operator.The bidirectional charging technology (for backfeeding power) now being explored could lead to even greater benefits. Indeed, it allows parked electric vehicles hooked up to a charging station or wallbox to be used as flexible energy storage devices. During periods of particularly high demand for electricity, these vehicles are able to feed additional power into the grid, while their high-voltage batteries are mainly charged at times when overall demand is lower. In this way, electricity from renewable sources can be tapped and stored as it becomes available. And the stored energy can, in turn, be deployed exactly when needed, whether for electric driving or boosting power grid capacity. Electric mobility can therefore help to stabilise power grids and limit the need to expand them, keeping electricity prices stable.Bidirectional charging assists the energy revolution.As well as improving power supply reliability, intelligently controlled integration of electric vehicles into the power grid can also further increase the proportion of renewable energy in Germany’s overall electricity consumption. By utilising the storage capacities made available in the high-voltage batteries of electrified vehicles, supply and demand for green power can be reconciled more effectively. Using these electric vehicles as a means of buffer storage allows the potential of wind farms and solar plants for carbon-neutral energy generation to be exploited to an even greater degree.For example, a surplus of solar power can be stored in the vehicles’ high-voltage batteries and later used for driving, fed back into the customer’s domestic network (“vehicle to home”) or sent to the power grid (“vehicle to grid”), so that any sudden supply bottlenecks can be alleviated without resorting to fossil energy back-ups from power stations. This adds further depth to the role of electric mobility as an intrinsic element of the energy revolution. Its continued spread serves to lower CO2 emissions both when driving and when generating electricity.Fleet test involving 50 BMW i3 models with backfeeding capability.In addition to devising systems for vehicles and wallboxes that are able to backfeed power, the Bidirectional Charging Management – BCM research project is also focusing on the development of technologies for energy management systems, plus hardware and software for controlling charging. The legal and regulatory parameters are being evaluated, too. Nowhere else has such an all-encompassing approach been actively adopted. All the relevant elements and variables for normal operation further down the line are being considered from a holistic perspective and aligned. The project will enter its practical phase at the start of 2021. A one-year pilot stage will see 50 private and fleet customers supplied with a BMW i3 with backfeeding capability, as well as the appropriate charging hardware and accompanying digital services, so they can test out the customer benefits of the solutions developed so far and their usability under real-world conditions. This will create a platform for subsequently implementing the technology across the board and so integrate electric mobility into Germany’s power grid.\n"}
{"prompt":"Right of way for green electricity by intelligent charging. BMW i and grid operator TenneT pilot new type of charging strategy for electric vehicles using the BMW i3 – Digital integration will turn electric mobility into a mainstay of the energy revolution – Customers can reap the benefits of reduced costs.   ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is working in close collaboration with power grid operator TenneT to devise groundbreaking solutions that will turn electric mobility into one of the mainstays of the energy revolution. An intelligent charge control system developed for BMW Charging can help to adapt electric vehicle charging in a way that keeps the power grid stable and makes optimum use of energy from renewable sources. Following successful deployment in the USA, the technology’s practicability has now also been demonstrated in Germany as part of a subsequent pilot project. Providing the platform for this new solution is the connectivity technology already included as standard in the all-electric BMW i3.The BMW Group is aiming to offer its customers ways of charging their electrified vehicles as easily and cheaply as possible while minimising the associated emissions. The digital integration of electric vehicles into the power grid will make it possible to adjust vehicle charging with customers’ mobility requirements, grid stability and the availability of renewable energy all factored in. Intelligent charge control can therefore play a role in preventing power grid congestion and give priority to green electricity at the same time. As and when the customer’s mobility schedule allows, charging of suitably equipped electric vehicles can be briefly decreased – in the event of an electricity supply shortfall, for example – in order to reduce the load on the grid. Charging of the high-voltage battery will resume as soon as the supply bottleneck has been alleviated, ideally at a time when sufficient reserves of wind or solar energy have accumulated.Intelligent charge control responds to signals from the grid operator. The system of charge control developed for BMW Charging acts as a link between car and power grid. It registers the grid requirements signalled by the operator, making it possible to control the charging of plugged-in electric vehicles for optimum results – whether the vehicle is hooked up to the electricity grid at a public charging station, via a BMW Wallbox or using a domestic power socket. The signals are processed by the digital charge control technology and the vehicle’s connected electronics.In the latest pilot project, the team succeeded in recording and processing signals from grid operator and project partner TenneT that indicated an imminent grid overload. This allowed charging to be temporarily decreased in selected BMW i3 cars in response. Electricity from renewable sources could then be integrated into the grid to optimum effect and there was no need to use backup power plants running on fossil fuels. The results from the pilot project represent further progress towards digital integration of electric vehicles into the power grid and pave the way for implementing this solution on a larger scale.Electric mobility: turning a problem for the energy revolution into a solution.As the number of electric vehicles on our roads continues to grow, so does the amount of electric power needed to fuel individual mobility. Considered in terms of total requirements, however, electric mobility is a relatively small factor. Independent studies predict that in Germany, for example, a fleet of two million electric vehicles would only increase electricity demand by around one per cent.At the same time, intelligent charge control means electric mobility can help grid operators handle new challenges arising from the increasing input of renewable energy. These centre on precisely balancing supply and demand – i.e. power generation and consumption – both geographically and in terms of quantity. Wind electricity generated in the north of Germany, for instance, must be able to reach consumers in the south. This is made more difficult when the grid is already working at maximum capacity. Without intelligent charging, this can lead to congestion that has to be cleared rapidly. So, if a particular region is at risk of an electricity shortage, the usual response is to increase output from coal- or gas-fired power plants that can be brought on line at short notice.Intelligent charging can help to keep the price of electricity stable. Known as “redispatching”, these interventions in the power generation network generate costs in the region of €500 millions a year in Germany alone – and these must be met by the power grid operators. Intelligently controlled charging holds potential to cut these costs, as briefly decreasing vehicle charging eliminates the grid congestion, allowing wind power to flow smoothly and dispensing with the need to use fossil energy in power plants.As integrating electric vehicles into the power grid and implementing intelligent charge control reduces redispatching costs, it can also help to limit expansion of the cross-regional network of power lines – and thereby restrict electricity price rises.Contributions made to stabilisation of the power grid also provide the basis for energy-linked business models, as owners of electrified vehicles can actually earn money through intelligently controlled charging. This represents a milestone on the road to realising the BMW Group’s vision of offering electric vehicle drivers electricity for charging their cars that is both free and generated with zero emissions.An all-encompassing electric mobility offering.The BMW Group has been running a precursor to the pilot project in Germany for several years already. The ongoing BMW i Charge Forward initiative in California has seen intelligent charging control – according to the needs of both customers and the power grid – undergoing practical trials under everyday conditions with a fleet of over 300 electric vehicles. The local grid operator has backed the scheme with financial rewards. And as the drivers of the electric vehicles participating in the scheme ultimately pocket the bonuses, this is a win-win situation for all involved.\n"}

In November 2018, BMW Motorrad presented the new BMW S 1000 RR at the EICMA motorcycle show in Milan (ITA) and announced its works comeback in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Now, a year later, BMW Motorrad Motorsport took positive stock of the maiden season of the new RR at the EICMA, and looked ahead to 2020. During a motorsport press conference at the EICMA stand of BMW Motorrad, Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, and BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers discussed the new Superbike’s first year in international racing. Tom Sykes (GBR), who will contest his second season for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK team in 2020, his new team-mate Eugene Laverty (GBR) and Team Principal Shaun Muir were also there. In the FIM Superbike World Championship, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK team caused a stir right from the very first race, with fast times and good results. Sykes claimed the first WorldSBK podium for the new RR at Misano (ITA) in June; the Superbike’s total haul for the maiden season was four podiums and one pole position. In July, BMW Motorrad Motorsport also announced that it would be entering a works team in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC). In its maiden race, the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet (FRA) in September, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance team finished in third place in a field of 56 starters at the first time of asking. In international road racing, Peter Hickman (GBR \/ Smiths Racing) rode to wins and records on the new RR at legendary events such as the North West 200, the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy and the Ulster Grand Prix. Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) of the alpha Racing-Van-Zon-BMW team also celebrated a commanding title win in the German International Motorcycle Championship IDM with the new RR. There were also other successes in various championships. “It was a fantastic first season for the new BMW S 1000 RR,” said Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, at the EICMA. “The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK team and our motorsport employees in Munich did an outstanding job in WorldSBK. Our maiden season in WorldSBK was a year of learning, for developing the racing motorcycle, but we didn’t have to wait long to celebrate our first podium with Tom Sykes. Further podiums followed, and we were consistently up there battling in the top six in this series with a top-class field so we exceeded our own expectations. The same is true of the FIM EWC. Within a very short timeframe, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team developed an endurance version of the RR, and the team was up there at the top from the start of the first race. We are also delighted to have continued the winning streak of our predecessor model with the new RR in international road racing. Our new Superbike also enjoyed success in national championships, such as the IDM, in which the RR was dominant. All these successes in the various race categories show that our production version of the RR is the perfect basis for developing racing versions to meet various requirements.” “When we started the development, we could not yet foresee these strong results,” added BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “We knew, however, that the new RR has a strong base. The first winter tests already showed that the bike had potential in race trim. Over the course of the season, we continuously improved the bike. The largest impact came from two engine updates. Furthermore, we brought new bodywork and considerable electronic updates and made modifications to the chassis. In general, development is a continuous process to close the gap to our top competitors. We have acquired a lot of data in our first season from which we can analyse our strengths and weaknesses. This will be our base to work from in the winter.” “It has been a manic season, the whole relationship with BMW Motorrad Motorsport and SMR started very late, so the challenge was always going to be difficult in its first year. Going into 2020 we can look at the success we achieved in 2019 and work on the good foundations we have built,“ said Shaun Muir, Team Principal of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. “I’m especially pleased in the way that we have steadily developed the BMW S 1000 RR at our pace, we have developed the bike in such a way that we are a force to be reckoned with and now we must take that to the next level. With the new addition of Eugene Laverty partnering Tom Sykes in 2020 we have a strong duo and we feel we can take that challenge to another level and challenge for wins.” Sykes and Laverty also gave an initial preview of the coming WorldSBK season at the EICMA and presented their BMW S 1000 RR for 2020 on the stage. “Regarding the 2019 season, I feel like the new BMW S 1000 RR was certainly able to showcase a lot of its potential,” explained Sykes. “Considering the fact that the project started very late I think that what we were able to achieve in that time is really impressive. The good thing as well is that during the season we were able to gather a lot of data and information which is now very valuable in the winter moving into the 2020 season. I’m very happy that I have the continuity and stay with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. And of course, my target is to win races and I feel that with a bit more time and development that is achievable. I can’t wait to start our programme for 2020.” His new team-mate Laverty is already looking forward to working with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK team: “I’m so grateful for this opportunity from BMW for 2020 and the faith that BMW has put in me. My aim is to repay with some race wins and I know that the bike is capable of that after the debut season that already saw the RR on the podium several times. I hope I can add to that in 2020.” Sykes and Laverty will also be on site on the public days of the EICMA. On Saturday . Sykes and Laverty will also attend the WorldSBK Paddock Show on Saturday. \n"}

The choice of images and the scenography are proposed by the photographer, under the artistic direction of François Cheval; the exhibition is produced by BMW Art & Culture The project completed during the BMW Residency.Continuing his reflection on refugees, after having shown the creation of a situation leading to exile, Emeric Lhuisset wished to work with certain individuals that he had met in Iraq or in Syria, and who today have become refugees. Through his project, the artist examines the western world’s perception of these individuals. During the BMW Residency at the GOBELINS School of Visual Arts, he was able to experiment with and improve on different technical processes.At Paris Photo, he presents images from his series \"Théâtre de guerre\" (Theater of war), inviting Kurdish combatants to replay their reality in dramatizations inspired by classical paintings. These images of women and men in battle make reference to this heroization. A series of cyanotypes followed, showing these same women and men, a few years later as refugees after having crossed the sea in search of a better life. The winner chose to use an old process, cyanotype in particular for its blue rendering – blue, the colour of this sea where so many vanish, but also the blue of Europe.Because it focuses solely on the event, photojournalism is usually presented as the only relevant commentary. However, an isolated event does not speak for itself. By nature, the speed of the event, its element of surprise, seem to correspond to the supposedly neutral qualities of the camera. Emeric Lhuisset breaks the taboo of immediacy in favor of an awareness, the fruit of commitment and questioning.François Cheval, artistic director of the BMW Residency, on \"L’autre rive\".\"The world is never seen as it truly is. This makes the photographic act the most common of illusions. That which common mortals do not know is included in the rules that we accept unanimously on a daily basis. In contrast, for those who make photography their profession, by vocation, the time that it provides and the means that it grants, besides any commercial or institutional determination, constitute the rare substrate necessary for creativity.\"In the exhibition, the public will discover a video produced by Clothilde Royer who followed Emeric Lhuisset during the creation and production of his work, within the framework of the means of transmission jointly decided by BMW and GOBELINS.The Hahnemühle paper mill, founded in 1584, is a partner of the BMW Residency for this project. Hahnemühle, which produces artist's papers for traditional art techniques and Fine Art papers, allowed Emeric Lhuisset to carry out research and experiments on its papers including the production of the Cyanotype prints of this exhibition, on Hahnemühle 600g 100% cotton Leonardo satin grain paper. Through this partnership with the BMW Residency, Hahnemühle is proud to support Emeric Lhuisset in his work and to be able to contribute to increasing his notoriety among a seasoned public.Lewis Bush, the ninth winner, who entered into Residency at the beginning of October 2019 will present the first images of his work in progress at GOBELINS. Born in 1988, Lewis Bush is a British photographer, writer, curator and educator. He worked for the United Nations Organization and then began to practice documentary photography in 2012. His work explores various forms of contemporary power. John Berger’s \"Ways of Seeing\" is Lewis's starting point in trying to decrypt and understand the images of today. He wants to work on \"soft power\" and \"cultural power\", on machines and their influence: the data they collect without our knowledge and the invisible power that they generate. He evokes a technological evolution that appears neutral. He will attempt to show the complexity of the technologies and their impacts on the world. Lewis Bush will also develop an application in enhanced reality in order to reinvent John Berger’s book.The opening will be held on Wednesday, 6 November, in the presence of the winners Emeric Lhuisset and Lewis Bush, of Vincent Salimon, Chairman of the Executive Board of the BMW Group France, Christoph Wiesner, artistic director of Paris Photo and a member of the Jury of the BMW Residency, François Cheval, artistic director of the Residency.Book signing of \"Quand les nuages parleront\" on Saturday, 9 November at 5:00 p.m. at the BMW sales outlet.

{"prompt":"Cutting-edge battery cell technology enables local emissions-free driving with a range of up to 55 kilometres – Globally popular BMW X3 model in the premium mid-range will in future be available with conventional combustion engine, plug-in hybrid system and purely electric drive.  ->","completion":" Munich. The unique combination of intelligent all-wheel drive BMW xDrive and cutting-edge BMW eDrive technology makes for sustainable driving pleasure in another BMW model. The new BMW X3 xDrive30e is already the third Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) in the brand's current model range to feature a plug-in hybrid drive and power transmission to all four wheels, offering exciting versatility and a purely electric driving experience as well as outstandingly low fuel consumption and emissions. Together, the 4-cylinder combustion engine and the electric motor of the plug-in hybrid model generate a maximum system output of 215 kW\/292 hp. The unique combination of the intelligent 4-wheel drive system BMW xDrive and state-of-the-art BMW eDrive technology reduces average fuel consumption to levels between 2.4 and 2.1 litres per 100 kilometres*. The relevant CO2 emissions amount to 54 to 49 grams per kilometre*. The combined power consumption of the new BMW X3 xDrive30e is between 17.2 and 16.4 kWh per 100 kilometres*. Its lithium-ion high-voltage battery equipped with the very latest battery cell technology enables purely electric mobility with a range of 51 to 55 kilometres*.The new BMW X3 xDrive30e will be produced from December 2019 onwards at the BMW plant in Spartanburg, USA – alongside the conventionally powered model variants of the BMW X3. The worldwide market launch is due to start in spring 2020. In this way, the BMW Group is consistently pursuing not only the electrification of its drive portfolio but also a product strategy geared towards the diverse needs of its customers. The globally popular SAV model in the premium mid-range segment is the first model of the brand to be offered with both a conventional combustion engine and a plug-in hybrid system – with a purely electrically powered model variant due to be added during the course 2020.Sports Activity Vehicle with agile handling, superior off-road performance and outstanding efficiency.The new BMW X3 xDrive30e combines the typical qualities of a Sports Activity Vehicle with particularly efficient drive technology. The plug-in hybrid model is likewise characterised by agile handling and sporty driving characteristics, robust versatility, a versatile interior, premium quality and advanced connectivity. Its BMW xDrive system permanently distributes the drive torque between the front and rear wheels as required – even when driving purely on electric power – so as to ensure sporty driving characteristics on the road and superior off-road performance over unsurfaced terrain. The drive power is generated by a 2.0-litre, 135 kW\/184 hp 4-cylinder petrol engine with BMW TwinPower Turbo Technology and an electric motor integrated into the 8-speed Steptronic transmission with an output of 80 kW\/109 hp. Together the two drive units mobilise a system output of 215 kW\/292 hp. The maximum system torque of the plug-in hybrid drive is 420 Nm. This allows the new BMW X3 xDrive30e to accelerate from zero to 100 km\/h in 6.1 seconds. Its top speed is 210 km\/h.Depending on the operating mode and the situation on the road, the electric motor of the new BMW X3 xDrive30e can be used either for purely electric mobility or to support the combustion engine. In MAX eDrive mode, which can be activated via the eDrive button on the centre console, the new BMW X3 xDrive30e achieves a top speed of 135 km\/h with a locally emissions-free and virtually silent drive unit. In the standard Auto eDrive setting, purely electric driving is possible at speeds of up to 110 km\/h. The combustion engine only switches on at higher speeds or when there are particularly high load requirements. When both drive units are active, the efficiency of the new BMW X3 xDrive30e is optimised, as is its sprint capacity. When accelerating, the spontaneous power development of the electric motor is clearly noticeable, while at constant speeds its electric assist reduces fuel consumption and emissions. The support of the electric motor ensures that the combustion engine can run within an efficiency-optimised load range as often as possible. The likewise available BATTERY CONTROL setting serves to keep the charge state of the high-voltage battery at a level determined by the driver. In this way, the power supply can be specifically reserved and used for local emissions-free driving on urban stretches of road during a lengthier trip.High-voltage battery based on the very latest battery cell technology for maximum efficiency; large, variable luggage compartment.The lithium-ion battery of the new BMW X3 xDrive30e is located in a space-saving position underneath the rear seat, while the fuel tank is positioned above the rear axle. This means that the transport capacity of the plug-in hybrid model is only slightly restricted. At 450 litres, the luggage compartment volume of the new BMW X3 xDrive30e is on a par with those models which have a conventional engine. By folding down the rear seat with 40 : 20: 40 split, the storage space can be extended to up to 1 500 litres. Thanks to cutting-edge battery cell technology and a gross energy content of 12.0 kWh, the high-voltage battery contributes both to the outstanding efficiency and the excellent electrical range of the new BMW X3 xDrive30e. As a result, the plug-in hybrid model can be used for a great deal of day-to-day travel without locally produced emissions – even beyond the city.The high-voltage battery can be charged at conventional household sockets using the standard-equipment charging cable. In this way, the battery can be fully charged in less than six hours. At a BMW i Wallbox, the same charging process can be completed in around three and a half hours. The charging socket is located under a separate flap on the front left side wall of the car. The electrical energy stored in the high-voltage battery is also used to supply the 12-volt vehicle electrical system.Electric licence plate and tax benefit thanks to the considerable electrical range.Thanks to its high electrical range the new BMW X3 xDrive30e fulfils the criteria laid down in the German Electric Mobility Act – depending on fittings – for classification as an e-vehicle, complete with special rights on public roads. It is also subject to reduced company car taxation in Germany. Only half the gross list price is used as a basis when calculating the monetary benefit from private use of the company car.As an alternative to the basic version, the new BMW X3 xDrive 30e also comes in the model variants Advantage, xLine, Luxury and M Sport. Its standard equipment includes acoustic pedestrian protection. When driving electrically at low speeds, an unmistakeable sound designed specifically for electrified BMW models is generated to alert other road users to the approaching car without impairing the acoustic comfort of the vehicle occupants. In addition, the new BMW X3 xDrive30e is equipped with an auxiliary air conditioning system as standard. It can also be controlled remotely from a smartphone using the BMW Connected App: the driver can therefore get into a warm vehicle in winter and a pleasantly cool vehicle in summer. New digital services help make it more attractive and convenient to charge the high-voltage battery when out and about. The digital services support the driver in searching for and selecting public charging stations, enable the charging process to be controlled via remote functions and transmit information relating to charge status, electrical and combined range and individual energy consumption to the driver’s smartphone or other personal devices.In addition, almost the entire range of optional equipment available for the conventionally powered versions of the BMW X3 is also available for the plug-in hybrid model – thereby increasing driving pleasure, comfort and individual style. This range includes an Adaptive Suspension, a Variable Sports Steering and a M Sport Brake System, the BMW Head-Up Display, Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function, Driving Assistant Plus with steering and lane guidance assistant and also Parking Assistant Plus. Another feature included in this range of extras is a tow hitch that can be electrically swivelled out and in. The maximum towing capacity of the new BMW X3 xDrive30e is 2,000 kilograms.New BMW X3 xDrive30e has a smaller overall CO2 footprint.The “real” environmental impact of plug-in hybrid vehicles has been questioned on occasion, especially in markets where the proportion of green energy used by the public energy grid remains small. The BMW Group conducted a full-cycle CO2 certification for the new BMW X3 xDrive30e – from raw material procurement, the supply chain, production and the use phase, all the way to recycling.This revealed the CO2 footprint of the new BMW X3 xDrive30e to be 26 per cent smaller than that of the new BMW X3 xDrive30i when running on average European power in the use phase. When charging the car with green energy, its CO2 footprint is reduced by as much as 54 per cent.BMW plug-in hybrid models offer an array of benefits in everyday use.BMW’s plug-in hybrid drive systems already offer users a host of additional benefits over traditional solutions:\n"}

A birdie at the third extra hole saw South Korea’s Hana Jang start the celebrations by claiming a home win in the BMW Ladies Championship at the LPGA International Busan. The 27-year-old had 269 strokes (-19) on her scorecard after four rounds, which put her level with Danielle Kang (USA). Jang took home a total of 300,000 US dollars in prize money for her fifth title on the LPGA Tour. Kristen Gillman produced the shot of the tournament. The American golfer hit a hole-in-one on the second round to win one of three BMW Hole-in-One Awards, a BMW 7Series Sedan. “Congratulations on Hana Jang’s winning at the only one LPGA tournament in Korea,” said Dr. Wolfgang Hacker, Head of Brand Management of BMW Group Korea. “I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to the galleries for their big support and applause for coming to the BMW Ladies Championship. BMW will continue to invest and contribute to the development of the Korean golf sports industry.”Jang (-7) and Kang (-8) produced by far the best performances on the final day and both deserved to reach the play-off. They both recorded par twice on the 18th before heading the third extra hole, the 10th. Kang scored par once again, while her South Korean opponent went one better, securing the greatest success of her career to date with a birdie.Kristen Gillman provoked wild celebrations during the second round. The 13th hole (par 3) certainly proved to be a lucky one for the US golfer, who is playing her first season on the LPGA Tour. The 22-year-old chalked up a hole-in-one from 164 metres with a 4-hybrid to win a BMW 7er Series Sedan.“It was nice to finally have my first hole-in-one because it's kind of been a running joke between me and my friends that I've holed out a lot of shots on par 4s and par 5s but never on a par 3,” Gillman said. “I didn't even look at the BMW 7 Series because I didn't even know I made a hole-in-one. When I asked my caddie, he said: ‘It's the nicest one. That's the one you want.’”However, no-one else claimed the two other BMW Hole-in-One-Awards, a BMW 8 series (hole 6) and the new BMW X7 (hole 16).\n"}

The debut season for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and the new BMW S 1000 RR in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) has come to an end. On Saturday, the two final races of the year took place at the ‘Losail International Circuit’, near Doha (QAT). The finale did not go quite according to plan. Tom Sykes (GBR) recorded two twelfth-place finishes, while his team-mate Markus Reiterberger (GER) reached 15th and 14th positions. Reiterberger’s side of the garage had high hopes for another successful day after Saturday’s afternoon warm-up session. Reiterberger was in the top three for a long time with his RR and threatened to chalk up a fastest lap before finishing the session in fourth place. However, the tables turned in the Superpole race, which started at 16:00 local time. Sykes began from fourth place but fell back through the field as the race progressed and crossed the line in twelfth position. Reiterberger suffered a similar fate, finishing 15th after starting from ninth place. This meant that Sykes began the main race on Saturday evening from tenth, with Reiterberger in eleventh place. Sykes and Reiterberger both enjoyed good starts. Sykes was in ninth place for some time but lost several positions as the race progressed before crossing the line in twelfth place. Reiterberger had to avoid another rider on the first turn and fell some way back as a result. He was, however, able to make up some positions in the closing phase, finishing the race in 14th place. Overall, it was a positive debut season for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. The team claimed four podiums, one pole position and numerous top six finishes. Sykes finished the season eighth in the riders’ standings will focus on the involvement of BMW Motorrad Motorsport in the WorldSBK. The main subjects will be a look back at the 2019 season and a preview of 2020. More details to follow. Quotes after race two at Doha. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Of course, that was not quite how we had hoped to round off the season. However, we continue to struggle to adapt to changing conditions, as we saw in these fluctuating temperatures. That is one of the areas that we will have to work on. We were able to collect more valuable information during this weekend in Qatar, which we will be able to use during the winter break as we prepare for next season. Overall, we feel positive about how it went. From the start, we viewed 2019 as a year for learning and we did record four podiums, one pole position and many top six finishes. That is something to be pleased about and we can build on this next season. I would like to thank the entire BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and our riders Tom Sykes and Markus Reiterberger. Everyone has been working hard since the project got going. No-one gave up after any setbacks and that ensured that this was a successful debut season. Thanks to everyone for that. Markus is now bidding farewell to the team – I would like to wish him all the best for the future.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a tough day today. We didn’t make much progress from the first day on track on Thursday and has been a difficult weekend ever since. We felt we had some momentum from Magny Cours going into Argentina, which didn’t turn out positively, and that has followed us really into Qatar where we have been chasing a set-up. Markus on paper looked like he was having a good weekend, he had good pace in race one and into the Superpole race but unfortunately could not convert that into strong positions today. Tom couldn’t find the balance nor momentum so sadly we are signing off in Qatar not where we hoped to be. However, on a whole we have achieved our targets of 2019 in what has been a successful first development season so onwards and upwards for 2020.” Tom Sykes: “It’s not the way I would have liked to end the season given the results that we have had previously. We have arrived at a circuit where you are in the corner for a long time which is an area on the bike that we need to work on, so overall a very disappointing weekend to end 2019. On the whole, the new project finishing eighth in the championship is relatively good considering there are six factory bikes from different manufacturers with a lot more experience. We have had some very strong showings, we have shown the potential of the BMW S 1000 RR and the relationship with the new team has worked well. Going into the winter I would like to think that the information the team gathered can be put into development and ultimately a better starting point for next season.” Markus Reiterberger: “We did adjust the bike a little for the warm-up and the session went really well for me. I was in third place for a long time and finished the session in fourth place. That felt fantastic. However, the first turn in both races put paid to my hopes a bit, although I had started well both times. In the main race, I got trapped between two riders on turn one. I had to take evasive action, which forced me to go extremely wide and cost me a few places. After that, it was a pretty lonely race for me, but in the closing stages I did manage to overtake three riders and score some points in the end. At least had some renewed impetus on my final weekend with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, which helps me to feel a bit better before the break. We had a great time and I would like to thank everyone for giving me this opportunity. I wish the project every success and I hope to be able to contribute something to it again in the future.” \n"}

The first day of racing at the 2019 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) season finale at the ‘Losail International Circuit’ in Qatar had highs and lows for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Markus Reiterberger (GER) secured eighth place in the first main race on his BMW S 1000 RR after having finished the Superpole within the top ten. Tom Sykes (GBR) had started the race from fourth on the grid but retired after a crash on lap two. Superpole was held in the early evening at 5 p.m. local time, already under floodlights. Sykes managed to make good use of the faster qualifying tyre and he secured fourth place on the second row in the final stages of the session. Reiterberger continued the positive trend from the practice sessions and qualified ninth on the third row. When the race was started at 8 p.m. local time, the air temperature was still a humid 31 degrees Celsius. Sykes stormed towards the front, into second place, but then slightly dropped back again. Entering the second lap, however, he crashed while battling and had to retire. Reiterberger also had a stunning start but lost positions in the first corner. Soon, however, he had worked his way back into the top ten. From there, he progressed further forwards, and after 17 laps he crossed the line in eighth place, directly behind a group of three that was fighting for fifth position. Quotes after race one at Doha. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We are happy with Markus’ performance, in any case. It was great to see that he was able to fight behind the group in the midfield. In the second half of the race, he was nearly as fast as the front riders in the two middle sectors. That is really pleasing, and one can see a kind of relief on his side of the garage. Tom had a mega start. Unfortunately he had a contact with another rider when entering the second lap and could not stop the bike anymore. That’s a pity but can happen in races. Overall, we have a good base for tomorrow and we will attack once more.” Markus Reiterberger: “Today was really good. I am satisfied, even if I did not fully exploit to 100 per cent what was possible. We made another step for Superpole and I was even able to do a 1:57.7 with race tyres that brought me to sixth place. It was a great lap and my feeling was really good. My lap with the qualifying tyre was also great but not perfect and this already makes the difference between a few positions. But ninth place on the third row still was good. I had a great start, until the first corner. I was already in fifth place but then I shifted down one gear too few and was in third gear. This resulted in the loss of positions but soon I overtook several others and worked my way back towards the front. From then on, I kept my pace to the finish line. The fact that I was able to close the gap to the group of three in front of me at the very end confirms that we are heading in the right direction. I hope that we will make another step tomorrow, especially with the front tyre. Then I think that I can catch those three that were in front of me, at least that’s my goal. I hope to bring home two more strong results.” Tom Sykes: “I think we maximised our performance in Superpole and got the best out of our BMW S 1000 RR. We were happy to start on the second row. We then made a couple of changes for the race. We had a good start and unfortunately then going into T1 on the second lap, it happened. I wanted to pull it down but there was another rider, so I had to pick it up and there was another rider there so unfortunately I made contact and down I went. So I am obviously very disappointed. I felt we had the set-up to put on a decent result today. We had the capability to come out with a good result today but sometimes these things happen and obviously we just look to have a strong showing tomorrow.” \n"}

This weekend, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and its riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Markus Reiterberger (GER) will contest the final races of the year at ‘Losail International Circuit’ near the capital Doha. After just a few months of development, the racing version of the new RR brings the curtain down on its first season in WorldSBK at Phillip Island (AUS) at the end of February. The debut season was intended as a learning year, with the goal being to gradually close the gap on the top teams. Sykes presented the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team with its first podium at Misano (ITA) in June. Since then, the team has celebrated a further three podium finishes and one pole position. One significant feature of the Qatar finale is that the races will start at 20:00 in the evening and will be held under floodlights. The entire schedule will also be brought forward one day. The race weekend kicks off with the first free practice sessions on Thursday. The Superpole qualifying and first main race are scheduled for Friday, followed by the Superpole race and the second main race on Saturday. Quotes ahead of the races at Doha. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Time flies. It only seems like yesterday that we lined up for the first time with the new BMW S 1000 RR at Phillip Island. We now head to the final races of our debut season in WorldSBK. We can be proud of what we have achieved in our first year. The podium finishes, in particular, were highlights. However, it is also important for us to consistently finish in the top six in this high-class field. We achieved that very often. There were obviously setbacks, but that is part and parcel of motor racing and is by no means unusual, particularly in a learning year. Despite all the success we have enjoyed, we must not forget that we are still developing the RR and still have things to learn in some areas. We are very much looking forward to Doha. It will be another challenge for us, but one we are happy to face. It’s all about gathering more information we can work with over the winter break.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “After a quite frustrating weekend at Argentina we now come to our final round of the season and we want to finish on a high. Overall, we had some good gains in straight-line speed at the last round in Argentina. We hope to carry that into the Qatar round where we know that we will need speed on the long straight. Equally, we feel the BMW S 1000 RR will be very strong on other parts of the circuit, with the fast and flowing aspects giving us some definite advantages over the competition. I think there’s an outside chance we can challenge for the podium. It would be a sweet finish to our first year in this partnership. The whole team has worked extremely hard and deserves a final bit of success before we focus on 2020.” Tom Sykes: “I am really looking forward to the races in Doha. For me, it’s always a great event there underneath the floodlights. I really enjoy the circuit layout. It seems quite unbelievable that we are already at the end of the season but certainly the development on the BMW S 1000 RR continues. Doha is a quite different circuit in terms of the general layout, so I’m really looking forward to trying the bike there and hopefully we can get a good result to finish off what I believe has been a very strong debut season for the new RR.” Markus Reiterberger: “I hope for an improvement in Qatar after the difficult weekend in Argentina. I know the circuit from 2016, when I raced there in WorldSBK. I hope the track will suit our new BMW S 1000 RR and am looking forward to the race weekend in Qatar. My goal is to end the season as strongly as possible. I want to work well with the team again. Together, we will try to make some progress. The weekend will obviously be a bit emotional for me – after all, these are my last races in the Superbike World Championship with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. However, I am looking forward to Qatar and am grateful.” \n"}

The final weekend featured three races and BMW S 1000 RR riders again enjoyed good results. Christian Iddon (GBR) was in contention for a spot on the podium on his Tyco BMW Motorrad RR in all three races. He came home fourth in race one, just 0.778 seconds behind third-placed Scott Redding (GBR \/ Ducati), who went on to take the title. Iddon then finished fifth in race two and fourth again in the third and final race. Peter Hickman (GBR) was seventh, eighth and fifth on the Smiths Racing RR. Taylor Mackenzie (GBR \/ Tyco BMW Motorrad), who has made the step up from Superstock to the Superbike class, finished tenth in the first two races and eleventh in race three. Alex Olsen (GBR \/ Smiths Racing), who has also recently moved from Superstock to Superbike, ended the weekend with three 13th places to his name. The best-placed BMW racer in the final Riders’ Championship is Hickman, who had qualified for one of the coveted places in the title Showdown. Hickman eventually ended the season in sixth place. Iddon secured seventh place overall at the finale, making him the ‘Rider’s Cup Champion’ – the title for the best-placed rider outside the Showdown. In the Superstock race, Daniel Cooper (GBR \/ Impcross Engineering Racing) was the best-placed BMW racer in ninth. Michael Rutter (GBR \/ Bathams Racing) came home twelfth. Andrew Reid (GBR \/ Tyco BMW Motorrad) and Rob McNealy (GBR \/ McNealy Brown) also picked up points in 13th and 14th place respectively.

An eventful week is drawing to a close for BMW i Andretti Motorsport. Following the digital ‘Season Kick-Off’ and the launch of the BMW iFE.20, the team was at the ‘Circuit Ricardo Tormo’ in Valencia (ESP) from Tuesday to Friday for the official tests ahead of Season 6 of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. The two BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers Alexander Sims (GBR) and Maximilian Günther (GER) completed a total of 536 laps over the course of the three productive test days. Sims and Günther took to the track in the BMW iFE.20 at the first meeting of all the teams and manufacturers involved in 2019\/20 Formula E, which took place in warm and sunny weather on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. BMW i Andretti Motorsport was able to work through the scheduled programme and gain valuable experience ahead of the start of the season on 22nd and 23rd November in Diriyah (KSA). Günther, in the #28 car, clocked the fastest lap of the week in a time of 1:15.087 minutes. Sims, in the #27 BMW iFE.20, set a personal fastest time of 1:15.359 minutes to finish seventh overall. All the Formula E teams used the Thursday at Valencia for video and photo shoots. Sims and Günther had already posed together for the cameras ahead of the test – as the main contenders in the digital BMW i Andretti Motorsport ‘Season Kick-Off’. The drivers and the new car were presented to the public in a video on the BMW Motorsport social media platforms on Facebook and YouTube. To accompany this, BMW Motorsport launched the #icelebrate Challenge on TikTok, in collaboration with well-known TikTok creators FalcoPunch, Sky & Tami, and PATROX. This challenge called on fans to celebrate the start of the Formula E season and the BMW iFE.20 together with the team. By Friday, the challenge had been met 13 million times. Reactions to the Formula E test week at Valencia: Roger Griffiths (Team principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“It is obviously nice to end the test week with Maximilian Günther’s fastest time at the top of the timing list. However, that does not mean an awful lot. We were also strong here last year, but were then unable to put that into practice over the whole season. For us as a team, it was much more important to optimise our internal processes and work together even better and more efficiently. I think we have taken a good step forward in that regard. That fact makes me more confident about the season ahead than the lap times do.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.20):“The test really helped us. We were able to get a lot of laps under our belt and, in doing so, gather valuable data that our engineers will now analyse carefully over the coming weeks. We were also pretty quick. That may generally be good news, but we know that the Valencia circuit is not necessarily typical of Formula E. I had a small bump on Friday, when I was too fast entering the chicane and skidded off, however, that was not a major problem. Thanks to my team, who repaired the car quickly. All in all, we head home in positive spirits.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.20):“The test week went well for us. The focus was clearly on learning as much as possible, looking ahead to the coming season. For us, it was primarily about continuing the development of the car and team processes at the circuit. That took top priority. Lap times were a secondary matter. I am pleased that we were able to do an awful lot of laps and try some things out. That was very important for me. I felt very comfortable in the car all week. I can hardly wait for the season to get started in November.”\n"}

BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’s hard work went unrewarded in the Sunday race of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in San Juan (ARG). Tom Sykes (GBR) finished in ninth place on his BMW S 1000 RR in the Superpole race, but then a technical issue forced him to retire from the second race in the afternoon. His team-mate Markus Reiterberger (GER) finished in 17th and 16th place. The ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’ hosted the twelfth and penultimate round of the 2019 WorldSBK season. With considerably cooler temperatures, the track conditions on Sunday were much better than on the previous days. Sykes started the Superpole race in the afternoon from 13th on the grid. He moved up into eighth place right after the start. He lost one place, but crossed the finish line in ninth place after a hotly contested race, which saw him secure a start position on the third row of the grid for the second main race in the afternoon. Reiterberger finished in 17th place in the Superpole race, which was his start position for the afternoon race. The hopes of Sykes moving up the field from ninth on the grid came to nothing. He initially dropped down the field slightly, before he was forced to park his motorcycle at the edge of the track on the seventh lap. Reiterberger was embroiled in several duels at the rear of the field and in 16th place missed out on finishing in the points by just 0.1 seconds. The finale of the 2019 WorldSBK season will be held in two weeks’ time, in Qatar from 24th to 26th October. Quotes after race two at San Juan. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It was a difficult end to a disappointing weekend. Unfortunately, we retired from the main race as a result of a technical issue with the clutch. However, we have to be realistic and say that we were never going to get a good result. We just didn’t understand why we were so far behind and what we needed to do to remedy the issue. We didn’t have consistent track conditions to enable us to find a solution. The track was catastrophic on the first day, okay yesterday morning, then extremely hot in the afternoon, and this morning it was back to being acceptable – these conditions meant that the lap times varied drastically. As a result, we were unable to gradually draw the necessary conclusions as to which direction we needed to take. We will now take the data we collected back with us, and will analyse why we weren’t as competitive as we had hoped this weekend.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Today was probably one of our most difficult days of the season. On paper, the Superpole race was not so bad for Tom. At least he managed to get on the third row for the start of the main race, but with this new model of bike we don’t have any data to work with, so everything is new for us. With every setting we try, we are chasing the perfect set-up. All we can do is take all this data with us and when we come back here again, we will have a better position to start with. So it’s been really difficult for us, but we must take the positives and build on this. Markus has also really struggled and didn’t find a comfortable setting, but we just have to close the book on this event and re-energise as we get ready for Qatar, where hopefully we can start on the front foot.” Tom Sykes: “It’s been a difficult weekend. We made some improvements on the greasy track condition and I honestly felt we had a consistent race pace during that last race, but we ran into difficulty with the bike which meant we had to retire. Overall, it’s been a challenging weekend for the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, but like I said it wasn’t the easiest of track conditions; however, given the circumstances I feel we gathered some very valuable information for the future. We will put this weekend behind us and move on to the next race in Qatar, where hopefully we can take another step forward.” Markus Reiterberger: “We had much better weather conditions today. It was cooler, which meant that the racing line on the track was in a much better state. Unfortunately, I made two mistakes on the first two laps of the Superpole race and went too wide. As a result, the race didn’t go well for me, and I crossed the finish line pretty far down the field. We made a few changes for the second race, and I felt relatively okay on the bike in the race itself. Points would have been achievable, and I battled with Sandro Cortese on the final three laps, but unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to get the point. Generally, we are still a little bit too slow and we need to find the reason why. I hope that I will end the season on a personal high in Qatar. We all pulled together here, and I’m grateful for that, even if we weren’t rewarded with a good result.” \n"}

In the GTD class, Bill Auberlen – who turned 51 on Saturday -, Robby Foley and Dillon Machavern (all USA) claimed victory with the #96 BMW M6 GT3 for Turner Motorsport. BMW Team RLL scored another GTLM podium. The trio of Connor De Phillippi (USA), Tom Blomqvist (GBR) and Colton Herta (USA) came third after sharing driving duties in the #25 BMW M8 GTE. Their team-mates John Edwards (USA), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Philipp Eng (AUT) finished ninth at the classic Petit Le Mans after an early technical issue with their #24 car. It was the second win of the season for the Turner squad. Auberlen now has 60 victories in North American sports car racing under his belt to equal Scott Pruett (USA). No other drivers have amassed more visits to the top step of the podium. Auberlen and Foley finished the season in second overall in the GTD drivers’ standings. After starting from eighth on the grid, the #25 BMW M8 GTE consequently worked its way through the field over the course of the race. On lap 236, Blomqvist took the GTLM lead for the first time, and kept battling it out at the front end of the pack with his team-mates until the very end. Blomqvist, De Phillippi and Herta ultimately claimed BMW Team RLL’s fourth podium result of the year. The team’s biggest success of the season was victory at the Rolex 24 at Daytona (USA), which had also been secured by car no. 25. An oil leak in the early stages of the race caused a long pit stop for the #24 BMW M8 GTE, driven by Eng, Edwards and Krohn. The big gap of several laps couldn’t be made up over the course of the race. In the GTLM drivers’ standings, De Phillippi is the best-placed BMW representative with 293 points in sixth place. BMW finished the season in fourth in the manufacturers’ standings with 327 points. Reactions to the Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director): “This was a successful season finale for us – in GTLM and in GTD. What a dramatic finish by Bill Auberlen. On the very last lap he secured GTD victory for Turner Motorsport with the BMW M6 GT3. Congratulations also go to his team-mates Robby Foley and Dillon Machavern. No other driver has scored more wins in North American sports car racing than Bill – his 60th win on his 51st birthday. This is amazing. It’s unbelievable to see what kind of performances Bill continues to deliver. In the GTLM class, the IMSA season ended in the same fashion as it had kicked off: with BMW drivers on the podium. We couldn’t score another win at Road Atlanta, but Connor De Phillippi, Tom Blomqvist and Colton Herta delivered a strong fight and were rewarded with third place. Congratulations to the trio of drivers and the BMW Team RLL crew. This was a positive finish to a season with several highs and lows. It’s a pity that our second BMW M8 GTE lost ground due to an early technical issue. A lot more would have been possible. Our GTLM triumph in Daytona was our season highlight. Now we will put in some hard work over the winter to make sure that we will be as strong there next year as in 2019. In addition, we want to fight for top positions on a more regular basis.” Bill Auberlen (#96 BMW M6 GT3, winner): “This was an unbelievable race. I just love Road Atlanta. Victory on my 51st birthday, second in the championship and now tied with Scott Pruett on 60 wins: this is crazy. I have won here for the fourth time. In 2020 I will try to do it again. I want to pass Scott in the winners’ list.” Robby Foley (#96 BMW M6 GT3, winner): “We started from the back, which is never ideal. Then you have to manage the risks you take. Still I was able to gain ground on my first stint and moved up to fourth. After that we were running very consistently. It was close at the end, but it all worked out. Thank you to Turner Motorsport. They gave us a great car.” Dillon Machavern (#96 BMW M6 GT3, winner): “My stints were not really eventful, to be honest. Robby did a great race in the beginning, Bill did a great job at the end. The Turner boys did a perfect job. That’s the great thing about these long races. You always have a chance to come back. It’s an awesome day.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M8 GTE, third place): “We started the season with a win, and we end the season on the podium. It was a hard-fought podium this weekend. The race had highs and lows, Tom drove a hell of a last stint. The right car was in the car at the right time. I couldn’t be happier.” Tom Blomqvist (#25 BMW M8 GTE, third place): “It was all or nothing in the end. And we made it. I’m really happy now. This event was just awesome. The last stint was pretty mental. It’s just great I could do this for the guys and everybody in the team.” Colton Herta (#25 BMW M8 GTE, third place): “Everybody did such a great job. We had a good handling in the car, and it really came alive in the night when it had to. We didn’t quite have the pace at the beginning, but we ended the race right. I’m happy to end my racing season on the podium.” John Edwards (#24 BMW M8 GTE, ninth place): “This is a very disappointing way to end our 2019 season. We did have some good races and a good pace, even today. But for us it just didn’t come together. Hopefully we can avoid these problems next year and fight for the championship in 2020.” Jesse Krohn (#24 BMW M8 GTE, ninth place): “Unfortunately we didn’t have much luck today. We had problem with the car and dropped 20 laps back. Then it was just a matter of bringing the car home. Today wasn’t our day.” Philipp Eng (#24 BMW M8 GTE, ninth place): “First of all I’m happy that our sister car got the podium. Unfortunately we were unlucky very early in the race which ended all our hopes for a good result. That’s a big shame, because we got a really strong race car today. Once we got into a rhythm, we were running really strong. I enjoyed my trip to the US again. It’s always cool to be with the guys over here.” \n"}

Sykes crossed the finish line in seventh with Reiterberger in eleventh position. The ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’ hosts the twelfth and penultimate round of the 2019 WorldSBK season. Teams and riders have been struggling with the slippery surface caused by sand on the Argentinian track. It was an issue for Friday’s free practice sessions and continued on Saturday. In Superpole qualifying, most riders were unable to take advantage of the softer qualifying tyres to improve their times in the closing stages of the session. The same went for Sykes who finished qualifying in 13th position. Reiterberger was 17th. In the race itself, Sykes and Reiterberger were among a total of twelve riders who lined up on the grid while a further six riders opted to not participate. After 21 laps, Sykes took the chequered flag in seventh position, with Reiterberger in eleventh position. Quotes after race one at San Juan. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “In general, a seventh place is not too bad, but it’s a result that should not be classified as such as quite a few riders did not participate. While probably only two of them would have been in front of us, the issue is that we lost 1.5 seconds per lap to the front. The track conditions are very, very tricky but it seems that other teams have found a solution to better cope with that. We need to be able to do the same. We made some changes and now have to analyse to which degree they have a positive impact. Our lap times have improved but in general we are too far away from the front.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Superpole was very difficult for us. We went into the Superpole like most riders with the first exit trying to find a good balance of the bike. Then we put the qualifying tyre on but did not make any progress. Tom normally does a very good step with the qualifying tyre and this time we could not improve the position. In the race, again we went a bit into the dark with a setting we wanted to try on the bike to give him some more mechanical grip. This appeared to make some progress forward but it was a very long race and the conditions were difficult so we are happy to come home with the seventh position. On Markus’ side, he simply struggled with his confidence and could not find the balance of the bike and therefore cannot come into the corners aggressively. And we know that on a circuit like this the competition level is so high and we must lift ourselves to that level. At the moment, Markus is finding that very tough – but he’s being professional and we will continue to try to find improvements overnight and make a step forward for tomorrow.” Tom Sykes: “Obviously we have really strange conditions this weekend, which is a shame. Here in Argentina, the circuit layout is absolutely fantastic, the fans are so passionate for the racing and unfortunately we have these bad conditions. We sat down and tried to get the best set-up for the BMW S 1000 RR. Honestly to finish seventh we had some good luck for this but we will take it and continue to set up the RR for the next race. We definitely got a lot of information that we will use for tomorrow to improve. This is completely new territory for us really and completely different surface conditions. We just need a little bit more time to adjust and we have seen the potential of the package in the wet and the dry. Hopefully now we have a lot of information to make a good step for tomorrow trying to keep a good solid run of results. The only downside is that our starting position on the grid is not ideal for the sprint race which ultimately sets you up for the big race. So we will see and keep working overnight and try to make the most of the situation tomorrow.” Markus Reiterberger: “Conditions in Superpole have been really difficult. It was much hotter than yesterday and even then the riders had said that it is dangerous to ride because it’s far too slippery; there’s too much dirt on the track and as result there is no grip. You have a line of a maximum of a metre you can use. If you leave that line you are close to crashing. It seems that the track had been cleaned over night and all was fine in the third free practice session. In Superpole, however, conditions were even worse which was very unusual. In these extremely bad conditions I could not qualify well and that’s how I started into the race. Many of the other riders did not participate. We sat together in the team and said: ‘We will race!’. The grip indeed was a bit better as it became cooler, but the race itself was a bit lonely for me. I had a good start and improved by two positions but then I hit the dirt in the first corner and nearly crashed. Then I had two more moments and all I did then was to bring it home and to at least collect some points finishing eleventh. It’s difficult conditions for all that we have to cope with. So I want to take the opportunity to thank my team because also with bad conditions and results we keep standing together, and together we give our very best.” \n"}

In the final spurt of the 2019 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK team is off to South America. The ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’ in Argentina will host the penultimate round of the WorldSBK season this weekend . The province of San Juan is in western Argentina, around 180 kilometres north of Mendoza. With its 4.276-kilometre ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’ it is one of the country’s motorsport centres. The WorldSBK stopped off in San Juan for the first time last year. Quotes ahead of the races at San Juan. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We are already very excited for the race weekend in Argentina. The fans there gave the WorldSBK a great reception last year, and no doubt the atmosphere will be amazing again this time. There will also be many BMW guests from Chile and Brazil who will come to support us on site. We have used the short break since Magny-Cours to continue working on improving our BMW S 1000 RR, and will be bringing new parts and ideas with us. We are expecting hot, sunny weather, and we need to try to prepare the bike for high track temperatures right from the first practice session. We will be relying on our experiences from the most recent races. The objective is to consistently be up there in the top five and to seize the opportunity of a spot on the podium if it arises.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First of all, we are looking forward to this event. I think we certainly made a good step forward with Tom in race one at Magny-Cours. We are now continuing this progress and have some good ideas. We also have some new parts coming to San Juan which should give us a good continuation of the progress. We are happy to be going to San Juan. Tom is confident and he knows he can challenge for the top four or top five. It is certainly a circuit that is very technical with a long straight, but we feel now with the progress we have made over the last few races that we can be contenders for these podium positions. Markus is new to San Juan, so it will take him some time to familiarise himself. Off the back of a difficult Magny-Cours we hope that he can get to know the circuit quickly and hopefully make a step forward.” Tom Sykes: “We are looking forward to going back to Argentina. The debut there last year was great. There were a lot of spectators who really showed a lot of passion for racing. It’s obviously a long journey going there but after that we have a great circuit layout. I feel that we can carry on in development with the information we have gained in the last couple of events. We have a very large uphill back straight at the circuit which obviously will not be our strong point, but the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is working hard and we will go there, give our best efforts and see where we can end up. After the weekend in Argentina I will be travelling to Brazil for an event for the new BMW S 1000 RR and that’s going to make it an eventful and exciting trip for me.” Markus Reiterberger: “Argentina is a very long way away, but I am already looking forward to the weekend. I’ve never been to San Juan myself, but I followed last year’s races on TV, and the track looks really exciting. I love overseas races because the schedule isn’t as packed as in Europe. I really hope that things will be better this time than they were at the last weekend at Magny-Cours. I would like to get a better result with my team in Argentina. I am motivated and am looking forward to finally getting to know this track that’s new to me.” \n"}

The ‘Dream Team’ line-up for the ‘Dream Race’ is complete: BMW works driver Marco Wittmann (GER) has been confirmed as the third BMW M Motorsport representative at the ‘SUPER GT x DTM Dream Race’ at Fuji (JPN). Wittmann will be competing in Japan together with BMW works driver and BMW brand ambassador Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) and local hero Kamui Kobayashi (JPN). BMW Team RBM will be in charge of the three BMW M4 DTMs. The ‘Dream Race’ in November is the first joint race event for the DTM and the Japanese SUPER GT in Japan. Wittmann claimed the DTM title with BMW in 2014 and 2016. In the just-ended 2019 season he recorded four wins and three further podiums in his Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM. He finished third in the 2019 DTM drivers’ standings. “Having finished the 2019 DTM season in third place, Marco Wittmann now completes our ‘Dream Team’ for the ‘Dream Race’”, said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “Marco is the most successful BMW DTM driver of recent years and is therefore the ideal ambassador to represent our DTM programme in Japan. We now have a strong driver line-up, with Alex Zanardi, Kamui Kobayashi and Marco. The journey to Japan is a trip into the unknown and an adventure for all of us. However, BMW Team RBM is an experienced DTM team that also knows all about the challenges posed by races in other countries. We are very well prepared for Fuji. The ‘Dream Race’ will be a fantastic event and we are all really looking forward to it.” Wittmann says: “It's great to be part of the ‘Dream Race’ in Fuji. Alex Zanardi, who is an idol of mine, Kamui Kobayashi and I make a strong team. I have been to Japan before, but have never been to Fuji. I really like the country. The people there are just so friendly, the fans are very enthusiastic and they love their motorsport. I am looking forward to the race and the event as a whole, and to the SUPER GT in particular. We have already seen what a great welcome the three cars from Japan received at Hockenheim. That shows that the DTM is going in the right direction with regard to the future. Of course, it will primarily be a show event but when the lights go green, you just want to be successful. So my aim is to be competing right at the front. I am looking forward to it so much.” BMW Team RBM, headed by team principal Bart Mampaey (BEL), has been competing in the DTM since the BMW comeback in 2012, having enjoyed many years of success in the FIA World Touring Car Championship (FIA WTCC). The team was responsible for the appearance of the BMW M4 DTM for the DTM show-run at the SUPER GT Finale 2017 at Motegi, Japan. “The name of the event says it all: it is a ‘dream race’ - and that is precisely what it is for my team,” says Mampaey. “I would like to thank BMW for choosing us to appear with the BMW M4 DTM. One one hand, it’s about competing against the SUPER GT teams in their home race at the foot of Mount Fuji, but it's also about the past. We tasted success in Japan in the FIA WTCC, winning races with Andy Priaulx and Augusto Farfus at Okayama. And there is the fact that we have a very interesting combination of drivers - with local hero Kamui Kobayashi, Marco Wittmann and of course Alex Zanardi. I had the honour of spending many years with him in the World Touring Car Championship, even though he never drove for my team. It is a great event and a real logistical challenge. The whole team is looking forward to our appearance in Japan. I am a Japan fan myself, and we can’t wait to get started.” In the ‘SUPER GT x DTM Dream Race’ representatives of the DTM manufacturers will compete against their Japanese counterparts from Honda, Lexus and Nissan. The event at Fuji takes place from 22nd to 24th November.\n"}

The race was interrupted due to a host of incidents at the end of the first lap and then restarted behind the safety car. The rain, heavy at times, continued throughout the race. The DTM season may be over, but the fans still have one more highlight to look forward to this year: on 23rd\/24th November, three BMW M4 DTMs will be competing at the “Dream Race” featuring the DTM and the Japanese SUPER GT championship at Fuji (JPN). Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) and Kamui Kobayashi (JPN) have already been confirmed as drivers. Reactions to the 18th DTM race of the 2019 season at Hockenheim. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“That was another extremely eventful race to round off the season here at Hockenheim. The weather played a dominant role and there were a few incidents where we didn't really make life any easier for ourselves. That all meant that fourth place for Timo Glock was the best we could hope for. However, we were aiming for much better results this race Sunday. And that is true of the 2019 season as a whole. Congratulations to Marco Wittmann on third place in the overall standings. He celebrated four wins for us and we also enjoyed success with Philipp Eng and Bruno Spengler. Despite some trying circumstances, neither our drivers nor anyone else from our team ever stopped battling. I am very grateful for that. Now we are totally focused on working towards 2020, so that we can do better. Congratulations to Audi on winning the title – and congratulations are also in order to Aston Martin after a promising debut season. Just like with the appearance of the Japanese manufacturers at Hockenheim, the numerous innovations were a breath of fresh air for the DTM 2019. The series is definitely moving in the right direction. Now we are looking forward to a highlight to round off the DTM year at Fuji at the end of November.” Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“That was a very difficult race today. Sometimes we were involved at the front and sometimes we fell right back. We tried to use our tactics to push Bruno Spengler up through the field. That was an unfortunate situation in the pit lane with Marco Wittmann; it was a matter of centimetres. We saw that the pit lane was really full and tried to manage the situation but our pit lane neighbour also made his stop at the same time. These are things that can sometimes go wrong when things are so tight. We are happy that no-one got hurt. We were also unable to move up any further with Timo Glock; the pace wasn't there. But my team did great work again this season. Thanks to all the mechanics and engineers for doing a great job for 18 races.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 5th, Race: 12th, Drivers’ standings: 3rd, 202 points):“Essentially, our race was over after the drive-through penalty. We still hoped for another safety car to help us get closer but that didn't come about. All in all, it was a race to forget. But the season is over now and I did reach the podium with third place in the overall standings. That is what counts and we can be proud of that. Compared to the competition, we didn't always have the best package. That means that third place is a nice way to round off a season of ups and downs.” Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 14th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings: 9th, 106 points):“Of course, ninth place is not a dream finish. But it was a good recovery performance after starting from 14th on the grid. The team's strategy was great. We stopped at exactly the right moment. That was perfect. We couldn’t have done any better. Now we have to focus on next year to make sure that we get the most out of our car. That is the objective.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 2nd, Race: 4th, Driver’s standings: 12th, 58 points):“That was a shame. I didn't get it right at the start and my wheels were spinning. I had big problems with grip all the time and it was very difficult to get the tyres working in the cold conditions. When I was behind René Rast, my speed was better but whenever I got close enough, so much water came in through the air intake that I lost some engine performance. That meant that I had no chance of overtaking him. At the end, I was involved in a little battle with Jamie Green. Of course, it's a shame that we just missed out on the podium by finishing fourth. I would have liked to have got there for the guys but it wasn't quite enough.” Bert Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“The conditions were difficult today. That start procedure was all about safety, which was absolutely correct. As it was very likely that we would see a safety car, we decided to split our strategy. We stayed out for a long time with Joel Eriksson. That secured sixth place for us, which is good. In some ways, the race reflected how our season has gone. There were some ups and downs. But we are ready to do better again next season.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 7th, Race: 14th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 144 points):“The race really matched how the second half of my season went. The heavy rain made conditions difficult and we tried to make the best of it. Unfortunately, that didn’t work out. I am just going to forget about it and go back on the attack next year.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 4th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 61 points):“That wasn't bad today. The pace during the race was fantastic. We showed that we can also go fast in the rain. It is nice to finish the season like that. Jamie Green and I had the track to ourselves when all the other drivers had stopped and we were really fast. Overall, that was not an easy race but the result was positive.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 15th, Race: 13th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 42 points):“Qualifying was poor and I was hardly able to make up any places. Overall, that was a difficult weekend for us. Looking back over the DTM season as a whole, I can say that I have learned a lot. I will build on that.”\n"}

He started from second and was able to hold on to the position until the finish. He had a bit of bad luck with the safety car as our undercut would have been his chance to move up, but then the tyres deteriorated towards the end and he wasn't able to mount any more attacks. Timo Glock also performed well, but we lost a bit of time during the pit stop due to a problem with the door. We got four BMWs into the top ten today, and we want to take another step in the right direction tomorrow. Marco has moved closer to second place in the drivers’ standings again. We are going on the attack and of course, we are aiming to claim that second spot on the podium again. Congratulations to René Rast on the win.” Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“Well, that was a great start today. All three of our cars made it into the top ten and the guys did a brilliant job. However, qualifying was tough this morning so Marco Wittmann's performance to claim the podium result was very good. Timo Glock had some extremely bad luck as he really could have made it to pole position. We made the best of it during the race. Bruno Spengler did a great job once again and was on the front foot. Unfortunately, we didn't quite make it to first place today but we will battle on again tomorrow.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 2nd, Race: 2nd, Drivers’ standings: 3rd, 202 points):“Today was a good day, with second place in qualifying and then in the race too. The first stint was OK. I did fall back to third place but I managed to work my way back and closed the gap to René Rast just before the pit stop. The situation looked promising. Our strategy to pit earlier than René also looked good. The undercut would have worked if the safety car hadn't appeared, but then I had to slot back in behind him. After the re-start, I saw my chance and took it but I realised pretty soon that I could not keep pace with René so he was able to overtake me with DRS one lap later and the gap stayed the same after that.” Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 14th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 9th, 104 points):“From 14th on the grid to finish in the points - I can be pleased with that. Eighth place is not a dream result, but it was the best I could do today. We had a good strategy and we stopped at exactly the right time. Many thanks to the team. We’re happy to claim the points today.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 7th, Race: 6th, Driver’s standings: 12th, 45 points):“I’m actually lost for words; when have you ever seen a door just pop open like that? I think that’s the first time that’s happened in my DTM career. It's even more annoying that it happened when I was in fourth place. My pace was very good from the start and I was able to keep up with Marco Wittmann, but the door kept opening wider and I lost so much top speed. It’s a great shame. All in all, we have to be happy that we managed to finish sixth.” Bert Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“We had a technical problem with Philipp Eng. We have to wait here until we get the car back. We learned a bit of a lesson with Sheldon van der Linde today. We chose a clever strategy, brought him back in and put on a different set of tyres. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite enough. Joel Eriksson was involved in an incident in a tight racing situation and lost a few places. We did manage to score two points with him at the end. Congratulations to Marco Wittmann on the podium.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 16th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 144 points):“I had a technical problem and I lost drive.

That was extremely frustrating.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 10th, Race: 10th, Classified as 9th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 53 points):“The start went pretty well, as did the re-start but two Audis spun in front of me; I wasn't able to avoid them and I came to a halt. I lost a lot of places due to that, and my race was effectively over. The pace was good but sometimes there is just nothing you can do.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 9th, Race: 16th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 42 points):“That was a difficult day.

As in previous years, BMW will also provide the VIP shuttle service transporting the fair’s VIP guests with the 7 Series and the X7.BMW Open Work by FriezeThe acclaimed Paris-based artist Camille Blatrix has been commissioned for the third edition of BMW Open Work by Frieze. Curated by Attilia Fattori Franchini, BMW Open Work gives artists a platform to push the boundaries of their artistic work, starting the project with a creative dialogue between arts, technology, engineering and design to pursue their practice in innovative new directions. Blatrix’s sculptures are interjected with coded references, creating emotionally charged, uncanny objects that offer new relational possibilities. Machine-like in their appearance, the works disguise the artist’s labor, each sculpture combining industrially fabricated elements with those that are meticulously handcrafted using a variety of traditional techniques. Blatrix presents his new commission for BMW Open Work at Frieze London 2019.Titled “Sirens”, the project is the result of an intense collaboration with BMW Individual, BMW Group’s division specialized in car customization. Central to the project is a sculpture which presents materials that are similar to those of a vehicle but transformed into strange and unfamiliar forms, away from automotive functionality. The main sculpture is presented in front of a BMW M850i Convertible . This intentional display suggests a dialogue between the artwork and the vehicle, a pull of attraction and repulsion, familiar yet uncanny. The vehicle, placed between spaces, also becomes a dialectical part of Blatrix’s installation, raising questions about functionality and desire, looking at the sculpture and recognizing itself in it, even if declined in a different form.Apart from the main work, a series of eerily synthetic sculptures, accompanied by a mesmerizing sound work, transforms the BMW Lounge into an intense but intimate environment.The enchanting refrain “Come to my harms and let your worries die”, sung by Blatrix’ “Sirens”, dramatizes the seductive, fascinating pull exerted by functionality and industrial processes. Making use of BMW Individual’s technical skills and craftsmanship, “Sirens” thus explores the primal and emotional relationships to labor, manufacture and materiality, creating a dialogue about sources of desire.BMW Open Work by FriezeBMW Open Work by Frieze is a major artistic initiative bringing together art, design and technology in pioneering multi-platform formats. For its premier in 2017, artist Olivia Erlanger integrated a motion-sensitive sculpture, audio and immersive fog in her work “Body Electric”; in 2018, Sam Lewitt engaged with BMW intellectual property and engine production to conceptually and physically explore the production cycle of a BMW engine in “CORE (the ‘Work’)”.BMW Group’s program during Frieze London 2019To celebrate the opening of Frieze London 2019, Soho House and BMW i host an art talk at Shoreditch House.

The BMW ‘Dream Team’ for the ‘Dream Race’ is taking shape. After the announcement of BMW works driver and BMW Brand Ambassador Alessandro Zanardi (ITA), Kamui Kobayashi (JPN) has now been confirmed as the second of three drivers for the first joint race event between the DTM and the Japanese SUPER GT series at Fuji (JPN). The ‘SUPER GT x DTM Dream Race’, at which representatives of the DTM manufacturers will take on Japanese opposition from Honda, Lexus and Nissan, will take place from 22nd to 24th November at Fuji (JPN). “Like Alessandro Zanardi, our second driver for the Dream Race is another real gem. Kamui Kobayashi will make his race debut for BMW Motorsport and is sure to attract plenty of interest in the ‘Dream Race’ from many of his Japanese compatriots and fans,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “Kamui has shown his class and versatility in Formula 1, Le Mans, and the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. He is sure to be fast in the BMW M4 DTM too. We will reveal the third driver in our ‘Dream Team’ for Fuji shortly.” Kamui Kobayashi will drive a BMW Motorsport touring car for the first time at the 4.563-kilometre circuit, which is within sight of the iconic Mount Fuji. The 33-year-old Japanese driver’s career includes 75 Formula 1 Grands Prix and two second-place finishes at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. At the Hong Kong E-Prix (CHN) in December 2017, Kobayashi drove two races in the ABB FIA Formula E Championship for what was at the time the MS&AD Andretti Formula E team. “First of all, I would like to thank BMW Motorsport for the offer to race in one of their BMW M4 DTM cars at the ‘Dream Race’ at Fuji. And also, I want to say thank you to Toyota for letting me take this opportunity,” said Kobayashi. “Fuji will be my first time driving the BMW M4 DTM, but BMW Motorsport gave me the opportunity to prepare a little bit and get an idea of the car. I will do my best to give the fans a good show with the BMW M4 DTM.” Before the Japanese man was welcomed on board, BMW Motorsport had already announced Alessandro Zanardi as its first member of the ‘Dream Team’. This will be the Italian’s second appearance in the DTM, having made a guest start in August 2018 at Misano (ITA), where he claimed a sensational fifth place on the Sunday. The Fuji race will be significant to Zanardi for another special reason: the racetrack will be the venue for the paracycling competitions at the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo (JPN) which Zanardi aims to qualify for. The Italian has already won four Paralympic gold medals and is a twelve-time world champion. \n"}
{"prompt":"30 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, BMW recounts the story of the desire for freedom, ingenuity and engineering skill – the movie “The Small Escape” will premiere on 2 October 2019 on Youtube and in the social networks.  ->","completion":" Munich. Thousands of exhibits in the Berlin Wall Museum on Friedrichstrasse, Berlin, commemorate the history of the once divided city, the tightly controlled border between East and West and the people who sought their way to freedom against all odds. On the upper floor near the window, which overlooks Checkpoint Charlie, there is the smallest escape car ever used: a BMW Isetta. Klaus-Günter Jacobi regularly accompanies visitors through the museum as a tourist guide. What only few people are aware of: Jacobi does not only know all about many escape attempts, but that it was his idea to hide a person inside the tiny bubble car and to cross the border with the unnoticed passenger. This is how his best friend managed to escape from East to West Berlin. 30 years after the fall of the Berlin wall, BMW recounts the tale of Klaus-Günter Jacobi, his friend Manfred Koster and the mini-car, which helped nine people escape the GDR. This story is the plot of the movie “The Small Escape”, which will premiere on 2 October 2019 as a TV spot, on Youtube and on other social media channels of the BMW Group.The elaborately produced blockbuster-style movie takes the audience back to the year 1964. Jacobi’s family had already left the East of the city in 1958, three years before the construction of the Berlin wall. When his old friend Manfred Koster asked him to help him escape from the GDR, he came up with a bold plan. His BMW Isetta was to serve as the escape car. The moto-coupé measuring only 2.30 meters in length and 1.40 meters in width would arouse little suspicion with the border soldiers, or so he hoped. And even today it stills seems virtually impossible to hide a person inside a BMW Isetta. The bubble car is already a very tight fit for two people on the seats directly behind the front door. The hiding place for his friend was built behind the seat bench directly next to the engine. Car mechanic Jacobi carried out the conversion in his former training workshop in Berlin-Reinickendorf. He cut an opening into the trim behind the seat bench, shifted the shelf upwards and removed the spare wheel, heating and air filter. He also exchanged the 13-litre fuel tank for a 2-litre canister to make space for the hidden passenger.“The Small Escape” shows how the BMW Isetta was turned into an escape car and how the risky border crossing played out. The thrilling history lesson was produced by director Alex Feil, camera man Khaled Mohtaseb and set designer Erwin Prieb in Hollywood blockbuster style. The props, costumes, vehicles and street sets were created in Budapest to stage a faithful 1960s Berlin setting. A checkpoint complete with wall and border strip was recreated resulting in an oppressive atmosphere which continues to grow throughout the course of the film to then culminate in a happy end. “Since their invention, automobiles have brought freedom and self-determination to humankind. Cars bring people together. This is something one should always also keep in mind in the current debate. The movie emphasises this. The moving escape story with the BMW Isetta can also be seen as a symbol of the invaluable value cars and individual mobility can have. It’s all about freedom, independence and dreams. Our movie recognises the drive and courage of the people who made this successful escape possible”, says Jens Thiemer, Head of BMW Brand Management.On 23 May 1964, shortly before the border crossing closed on midnight, the BMW Isetta converted by Klaus-Günter Jacobi, rolled underneath the opened barrier. Shortly after crossing, he freed his friend Manfred from his hiding place behind the seat bench and took him in his arms delirious with joy. This was the only time Jacobi’s BMW Isetta was used as an escape car, but his achievement was to inspire imitators. Eight further GDR citizens managed to escape to the West over the following years in a similarly converted BMW Isetta. Today this car is on display in the Berlin Wall Museum. The movie “The Small Escape” will also be a permanent exhibit of the permanent exhibition on spectacular escape attempts.The movie „The Small Escape“ can be watched on the BMW Youtube and other channels. The detailed story of Klaus-Günter Jacob, his BMW Isetta and the spectacular escape of his friend across the internal German border is told on www.bmw.com.\n"}

The BMW drivers have six wins, a further seven podiums and six pole positions to their name so far this season. In an interview, BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt discusses a difficult season for BMW M Motorsport in the DTM and looks ahead to 2020. ->","completion":" Munich. The 2019 DTM season is on the finishing straight. The BMW teams’ preparations for the grand finale at the Hockenheimring (GER), with races on 5th and 6th October, are in full swing. The BMW drivers have six wins, a further seven podiums and six pole positions to their name so far this season. Marco Wittmann (GER) still has a mathematical chance of finishing runner-up in the Drivers’ Championship. In an interview, BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt discusses a difficult season for BMW M Motorsport in the DTM and looks ahead to 2020. Mr Marquardt, the final round of the DTM at Hockenheim is almost upon us. What are your goals for the two races?Jens Marquardt: “We want to head into the winter break on the back of at least one victory at Hockenheim. We owe that to our fans, at least. They have supported us brilliantly, despite a difficult year in the DTM. We want to thank them for that. We have shown over the course of the season that our overall package has what it takes to win races.” How would you sum up the season so far?Marquardt: “Of course we are not happy with where we find ourselves after 16 DTM races. We started the season well, but, for various reasons, we have run out of steam a little since the middle of the season. This is not what we demand of ourselves. We want to be challenging for the title right down to the final round of a championship. The fact that we have not managed that this season is a disappointment for everyone. At the same time, we will use that disappointment to spur us on and motivate us for next season. We must, and will, improve next season, so that we have a say in who wins the title.” What are the reasons for this, and how will you approach the comeback?Marquardt: “After a season like this, in which we have come up short of our own expectations, we will optimise a number of areas – based on the means we have at our disposal. For example, we are currently examining exactly what configuration and structure the BMW M4 DTM will be run in the future. We must obviously get to grips with such issues as reliability. Our two works teams will continue to play a key role. Although there is always potential for improvements on both sides, the crews of Bart Mampaey and Stefan Reinhold are working at a very high level. For this reason, we are also planning on working with our RBM and RMG works teams next season. At the same time, we are also performing a self-critical analysis in Munich and are pinpointing things we want to do better in the future, in order to also restore some consistency to our results. The prerequisite for all this is passion. That is what made us and our team strong and helped us to titles in the past, and that is what I want to see from every single individual.” How does the driver line-up look?Marquardt: “Our drivers are just as much a part of the overall DTM package as the car and the teams. As such, we will also be looking closely at this area. Our goal has to be to remain as compact as possible, both in qualifying and the race. This season, we have not always been as successful in this regard as we were in the second qualifying session at the Nürburgring, when five of our six drivers set times within one tenth of a second of each other. We are also performing an analysis to identify the cause of this.” Generally speaking, how many seats are up for grabs?Marquardt: “We are planning on at least six BMW cars for next year’s DTM. Whether there will be a private BMW team remains to be seen. Our premise remains that the private team can cover the running costs itself. BMW will not take on any additional budget. That is not the underlying idea – and would not be expedient, neither for us nor the team. BMW has a very clear philosophy in that regard.” \n"}

The 2019 DTM season comes to an end with races 17 and 18 at Hockenheim (GER) this weekend. For BMW M Motorsport and the BMW DTM teams, the objective for the season finale is to head into the winter break on a high. At the season opener in May, BMW M Motorsport started the new turbo era with success at the same track: On Saturday, Marco Wittmann (GER) took the first pole position and the first win for the then new BMW M4 DTM with turbo drive; on Sunday, Philipp Eng (AUT) drove to pole position, while Wittmann completed the front row of the grid. Wittmann is in third place overall heading into the finale, and is still in contention for second place in the driver’s standings. A top three finish is also still within reach for Eng, who is currently in fifth place. One of the highlights of the final weekend is the Japanese SUPER GT joining the action. Before the two series hold their first joint ‘dream race’ at Fuji (JPN) in November, three cars from the SUPER GT will compete as guest starters at Hockenheim. Former Formula 1 world champion Jenson Button (GBR) is just one of the drivers who will make an appearance. BMW M GmbH is using the finale of the DTM season at Hockenheim as a stage for the world premiere of the new BMW X5 M (CO2 emissions : 296 – 291 g\/km, \n"}

Following the podium finish for Tom Sykes (GBR) on Saturday, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team endured a difficult Sunday at Magny-Cours (FRA). Sykes finished eighth on his BMW S 1000 RR in both the Superpole Race and the second main race. Team-mate Markus Reiterberger (GER) came home 17th and 15th. Magny-Cours was the venue for round eleven of this season’s FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Sykes started the morning’s Superpole race from sixth place. As in the opening race on Saturday, he soon worked his way into fourth place. This time, however, he was unable to mix it with the front-runners and eventually had to settle for eighth place. Consequently, Sykes started the second main race on Saturday afternoon from eighth place. He initially climbed to sixth place, but then dropped back through the field over the course of the race, eventually crossing the finish line eighth after 21 laps of racing. Reiterberger started the Superpole race and race two from 19th place. He was 17th in the morning, before finishing 15th to score one point in the afternoon race. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team now travels to San Juan in Argentina, where the penultimate round of the season will take place in two weeks’ time . The finale will be held in Qatar at the end of October. Quotes after race two at Magny-Cours. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Sunday was disappointing for us. The set-up changes we tried out in the warm-up did not have the desired effect for Tom. We were unable to back up the performance we showed on Saturday. The track temperatures were significantly higher, even in the earlier Superpole race. After a strong start, we fell back through the field. We also started strongly in race two, but then lost roughly a second per lap to our rivals, which meant we had no chance of challenging for a spot on the podium. We are lacking mechanical grip when accelerating in the lean position. This becomes all the more important as soon as the track temperature starts to rise. We must now see whether we can react in time for the next races, in order to learn as much as possible and to end the season strongly.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The Superpole race was quite difficult for all of us. Tom struggled a bit on the faster parts of the circuit. He settled into a position we had to be happy with although it was a bit disappointing after yesterday. Markus really struggled and overall it has been a difficult event for him. In the main race, Tom got a really good start and was with the front guys but sadly he could not find the confidence and performance he had yesterday. He was a second per lap slower and finished way off the top-3 or top-4. The whole team needs to have a look at the data and the information and try to understand why this happened. After such a great Saturday it was disappointing to take a step backwards and we need to try to rectify this for Argentina.” Tom Sykes: “I am obviously a bit disappointed with today but we were struggling in certain areas with the bike and I really tried to ride around some of the issues. But we certainly made some progress in terms of a couple of things and feel quite confident in some areas and just need to work again now on another part of the chassis to enable us to be stronger over the distance. So it was a slightly disappointing day given the result on paper but also a day where we got a lot of information so hopefully we can build on this and move forward. There are a couple of difficult rounds coming up for us but we keep our head down, keep trying to progress and just keep the information coming before we go into the winter break.” Markus Reiterberger: “The weekend was really tough. I think that our results do not show our potential and are for sure not where we want to be – neither me nor the team. We need to find a solution to improve my feeling for the bike so I can ride faster. I want to reach the top ten – that is my goal for the final two rounds of the season. I want to thank the entire team for their hard work and sorry for the bad results.” \n"}

His team-mate Markus Reiterberger (GER) endured a difficult Saturday, finishing in 16th place. Magny-Cours is the venue for round eleven of the 2019 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK).The morning’s Superpole was delayed by half an hour due to a dirty track. Earlier rainfall meant conditions were still wet and the special qualifying tyres could not be used. Sykes was sixth fastest on his RR, earning him a spot on the second row of the grid. Reiterberger qualified 19th.By the start of the race at 14:00, the majority of the track was dry. Starting from sixth place, Sykes soon worked his way through the field and took the lead on his RR on lap two. He fended off all the attacks from behind and held onto first place in a fiercely-competitive leading group until lap six. The battles for position continued at the front of the field, and initially saw Sykes drop back to fifth place. When Michael van der Mark (NED \/ Yamaha) crashed out of the lead, Sykes adopted fourth place. However, the Brit was not happy with that position and pulled off a courageous manoeuvre on the penultimate lap to overtake Frenchman Loris Baz (Yamaha) and went on to claim another podium in third place. Reiterberger came home 16th, narrowly missing out on the points by just 0.3 seconds.Quotes after race one at Magny-Cours.Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Tom’s third place is a strong result after chaotic weather conditions on Friday and Saturday morning. The practices on Friday, which took place in unsettled weather, were positive for Tom, although that was not reflected directly in the results. We were not able to take full advantage of our qualifying performance on wet tyres, as we did not select the ideal tyre type in the unsettled conditions. We had targeted the front row of the grid, but Tom at least managed to limit the damage with sixth place. Tom’s first lap was simply fantastic. By lap two we were running P1. From then on, the race was very eventful and full of changes. In all the commotion, we dropped back to fifth place. However, Tom delivered a really strong performance in the closing stages too, which allowed us to claim our next podium finish – with a little help from our rivals. That is very pleasing and confirms that our updates are performance-enhancing. Markus has been struggling with his confidence in the set-up of his RR all weekend. Unfortunately, he was also plagued by a problem with the electronics in the race which made his performances look worse.”Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Tom was disappointed with superpole. We were happy with the result; Tom was focused on the front row but unfortunately we made the wrong choice in the tyre, nevertheless we were pleased with P6. Markus really struggled with the bike and felt as though he was riding on ice which reflected in his time. Unfortunately this continued into the race and he was too far back to really make an impact. Overall, race one was probably the best race of the season. Tom took the lead and battled really well, he conserved his tyre well and set a solid pace and maintained that pace to the very end. As expected, he got closer to the front guys towards the end of the race and picked off Loris Baz in the final few laps so we are extremely happy to add another podium to the season. We have gained a lot of information ahead of tomorrow and taken a great step forward in the development of the BMW S 1000 RR which is a credit to the whole of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team.”Tom Sykes: “It was an eventful race and an absolute pleasure. I really enjoyed riding that one. A credit to the whole team; we’ve made some changes to the bike in between Portimão and here and it’s just nice as I am able to do things a little bit better on the track. I really enjoyed that race, especially in the beginning, battling with a few guys and just feeling in a better position and being able to fight. The chassis and the tyre really stayed consistent throughout the race. Certainly we need to find a little bit in some areas but overall a podium with just the two Kawasakis in front is really promising here given that we are only ten months into the programme. I am really, really happy with our efforts and hopefully we can keep this pace for tomorrow.”Markus Reiterberger: “Unfortunately, I had issues with the electronics in practice this morning. As a result, I was only able to complete four or five laps when the track conditions were a bit drier. However, that was still good enough for 13th place. It then poured down again in the Superpole. As I spent more time than anyone on the track in these conditions yesterday, I did hope that this might play into my hands, however, I did not feel at all comfortable on the bike. The rear wheel was like riding on soap and I was unable to get any purchase. It was very difficult to ride. 19th place on the grid is not where I want to be starting from. Unfortunately, I did not get off to a good start in the race. It was generally very difficult to ride, partly because I had electronics problems again. I really hope that we identify the issue quickly and are soon able to find something that helps me.”\n"}

All the materials and textiles used are robust and long-lasting and they fulfil the highest standards of safety and functionality.The famous colour identity of the early classic motorcycles – bold black metal parts adorned with the fine white decorative lines, the so-called TwinStripes – is reflected throughout the entire collection. The original branding and the BMW metal emblem are also incorporated in the design. The copper-coloured details and visual accents displayed in these garments hark back to the materials used in classic BMW motorcycles. The new collection celebrates the history of BMW Motorrad and its longlasting passion for motorcycling.The history of BMW Motorrad dates back to 1923. The first BMW motorcycle to go into production was the R32 – naturally equipped with an air-cooled, two-cylinder flat-twin boxer engine. In 1978, BMW Motorrad became a pioneer in a completely new field, as one of the first serial-production manufacturers in the world to introduce its own rider equipment range.The Heritage segment was established with the market launch of the BMW R nineT in 2014 and has since become one of the most important segments of the BMW Motorrad brand. In the coming year, the segment is set to expand into fully new dimensions. BMW Motorrad has announced the launch of a serial-production motorcycle for the second half of 2020, which will mark its entry into the Cruiser segment.The BMW Motorrad Heritage Collection will be available from January 2020.

The BMW 3 Series was judged to be the best new car design of the year, earning it the Autonis 2019 award. It also led the way in the Car Connectivity Award’s blue-riband discipline, claiming the title of best-connected car in the Connected Cars category.BMW picked up three more accolades in this year’s edition of the Car Connectivity Award. In a poll of the magazines’ readers, the BMW Live Cockpit Professional, the Driving Assistant Professional package and the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System each took top spot in their respective categories. The winning systems already enhance driving pleasure, safety and comfort in several of the brand’s model ranges. The prizes were presented yesterday at an awards ceremony in Stuttgart.Captivating design, progressive connectivity: a double success for the new BMW 3 Series. The design of the new BMW 3 Series is a modern take on the sporting elegance for which BMW is renowned, and winning the Autonis 2019 delivers striking evidence of how much it appeals to popular taste; with 32.3 per cent of the votes, the new BMW 3 Series was the clear winner in its class. This was the 14th time a readers’ vote had decided the Autonis winners. More than 13,700 readers of auto, motor und sport took part in the latest poll and were asked to choose their favourites from 100 new models spanning ten vehicle classes.The Car Connectivity Award is also put to a public vote, with over 12,000 readers of auto, motor und sport and Moove participating in its sixth edition. Standout systems and technologies from BMW in the areas of connectivity, navigation, driver assistance and audio attracted the most votes in four of the eleven categories. The new BMW 3 Series was victorious in the Connected Cars category, taking 35.7 per cent of the votes. The new BMW 3 Series Sedan was the brand’s first new model to be offered with the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant as an option.

Of course, there is a very long straight there which we can’t deny we probably will face some difficulties on. But I’m looking forward to working with the team again and going in the direction which we have done all year, which is slowly working towards where we need to be. Unfortunately, the weather forecast does not look particularly welcoming, but on a positive, we’ve also had very strong results with the new RR in wet conditions. So we’ll go there and try to make as strong a weekend as possible.” Markus Reiterberger: “Magny-Cours is a cool track. I won the title in the FIM European Superstock 1000 Championship there last year which is why I have great memories of this track. It wasn’t an easy track for us, but we did really well there, and I think that the new RR will be even better on the track. I hope that I won’t be far behind my team-mate and, if possible, will be able to ride on a par with him. My primary goal is to improve my race pace, and I hope that we will take another step forward in terms of tuning, like we did at Portimão.

An extraordinary trio of BMW Motorsport drivers will line up at the first joint race event between the DTM and the Japanese SUPER GT series in Fuji (JPN). One of the drivers is now confirmed: BMW works driver and BMW Brand Ambassador, Alessandro Zanardi (ITA). From 22nd to 24th November, DTM manufacturers BMW and Audi will be at the former Formula 1 circuit near Fuji (JPN) for a joint race with SUPER GT cars from Honda, Lexus and Nissan. This first for the two series has been named the ‘SUPER GT x DTM Dream Race’ and, as in the DTM, will consist of one race on the Saturday and one on the Sunday. Zanardi’s BMW team-mates for Fuji will be announced at a later date. “Nobody has forgotten Alex Zanardi’s magnificent guest DTM start at Misano in 2018. As such, we are delighted that he will now be returning to the wheel of the BMW M4 DTM as part of our dream team for Fuji,” says BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “Alex inspires people all over the world and it is fantastic to have him on board in Japan. We are confident that he will cause just as much of a buzz as he did at Misano and most recently at the 24 Hours of Daytona. We will reveal the drivers to complete our trio at Fuji at a later date.” In August 2018, Zanardi made a guest appearance in the two DTM races at Misano, Italy, where he finished a sensational fifth on the Sunday. The BMW M4 DTM had been specially modified for Zanardi, including a handbrake system and an accelerator ring on the steering wheel, allowing him to drive without his artificial legs. In January 2019, the 52-year-old raced in the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) in a similarly adapted BMW M8 GTE. In preparation for Fuji, Zanardi will return to the cockpit at the start of October, when he will drive a modified BMW M6 GT3 at the penultimate race weekend of the 2019 Italian GT Championship at Mugello (ITA). “To compete in the Dream Race with the DTM and Super GT is something wonderful for me. The word ‘wonderful’ is probably used too often, but it is really appropriate in this case,” says Zanardi. “The mere fact that I am still able to go racing is like a gift for me anyway. However, the BMW M4 DTM is definitely one of the best race cars I have driven in my career. Plus, I will have an extra 100 hp under the bonnet this year. It is going to be fantastic, and I am extremely grateful to BMW Motorsport for this opportunity. I know that racing in the DTM is a huge challenge, as all the drivers are highly-professional and excellently prepared. And this time we will also have the drivers from Super GT too. As such, my expectations are not too great, from a sporting perspective. I just want to perform to the best of my ability and put on a display worthy of the event. On the whole, however, I am sure that this is going to be another great chapter in my motor racing career.” Zanardi’s appearance at the ‘Fuji International Speedway’ is significant also for another reason. The racetrack will be the venue for the paracycling competitions at the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo. Zanardi’s goal is to qualify for the Tokyo Games. \n"}
{"prompt":"Plug-in hybrid variant of the Sports Activity Vehicle in the premium compact segment combines agile versatility with exemplary fuel consumption and emissions – efficient electric motor and cutting-edge battery cell technology allow locally emissions-free travel up to a range of 57 kilometres*. ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is consistently driving its electrification strategy forward and presents a further plug-in hybrid model for an especially popular and dynamically growing vehicle category. In the new BMW X1 xDrive25e, the intelligently controlled interaction between a fuel combustion engine and an electric motor as well as locally emissions-free travel can now be experienced in the Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) premium segment. A highly efficient electric drive and a latest-generation lithium-ion battery enable an electrically powered range of up to 57 kilometres*. With an average fuel consumption from 2.0 litres per 100 kilometres* and CO2 emissions from 43 grams per kilometre*, the new BMW X1 xDrive25e sets a benchmark within its competitive field. Its combined power consumption is from 13.5 kWh per 100 kilometres*. The hybrid specific all-wheel drive with its fast and precise distribution of power between the front and rear wheels delivers a high level of driving pleasure and thrilling agility.The plug-in hybrid system of the new BMW X1 xDrive 25e consists of a 1.5 litre 3-cylinder petrol engine with BMW TwinPower Turbo Technology and an electric drive specially developed for this model. It is taken from the eDrive technology modular system of the BMW Group. The petrol engines mobilises a peak output of 92 kW\/125 hp and a maximum torque of 220 Newton metres. It transfers its power to a 6-speed Steptronic transmission and drives the front wheels. The electric motor generates an output of 70 kW\/95 hp and delivers 165 Nm of torque to the rear wheels via a single-speed transmission. This makes for a hybrid specific all-wheel drive, which gives the BMW X1 xDrive25e a unique level of agility in its competitive field delivering hallmark SAV driving pleasure. The highly responsive power delivery of the electric motor, which delivers its full torque spontaneously from standstill enables the driver to react extremely quickly to changing driving conditions. In addition the position of the electric motor above the rear axle contributes to the harmoniously balanced axle load distribution of the new BMW X1 xDrive25e. In conjunction with the intelligently controlled interaction between the two power units, it provides maximum driving stability, ride comfort and dynamic response.Together the combustion engine and electric motor produce a system output of 162 kW\/220 hp. The maximum system torque of both drive units is 385 Nm. The new BMW X1 xDrive25e accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h in 7.0 seconds. In addition, the electric boost provided by the drive system ensures additional safety reserves and intense sporty flair when overtaking on country roads, for example. The top speed of the plug-in hybrid model is 192 km\/h.With the very latest battery cell technology the new BMW X1 xDrive25e possesses generous reserves of electrical energy enabling the driver to conduct the main share of everyday travel locally emissions-free with the electric motor alone. The latest-generation lithium-ion battery has a gross energy content of 9.7 kWh. This allows for an electrically powered range of up to 57 kilometres* in the BMW X1 xDrive25e. The high-voltage battery can be charged at conventional household sockets using the standard-equipment charging cable. The battery can be fully charged in around five hours in this way. Using a BMW i Wallbox, the relevant charging operation takes less than 3.6 hours. The charging socket is located under a separate flap on the front left side wall of the car.The driver can use the eDrive button on the centre console to influence the drive system’s operating mode. In the AUTO eDRIVE standard setting, the intelligent drive system ensures optimum interaction between the two power units in all driving situations. Navigation data is also used to manage the plug-in hybrid system to increase both efficiency as well as driving pleasure. When navigation guidance is activated, the anticipatory energy management can also take into account the route profile for controlling the drive system. The MAX eDrive mode can be activated for maximum use of the electric drive. In this mode, the new BMW X1 xDrive25e reaches a top speed of 135 km\/h. In addition there is also the SAVE BATTERY mode. It enables the driver to maintain the charging state of the high-voltage battery while driving or to increase it by means of recuperation. In this way battery capacity can be saved for later use when driving in purely electric mode in the city for example. The driving experience switch can be used independent of the drive mode. In the new BMW X1 xDrive25e, the driver can use this to activate the COMFORT, SPORT and ECO PRO modes in order to influence the drive and suspension functions as well as to operate the electrically powered comfort systems.Due to is long electric range and its low CO2 emissions, the new BMW X1 xDrive25e (depending on equipment) meets the criteria which have been stipulated for the classification as an electric vehicle in Germany and the associated preferential treatment in public road traffic. In addition it also qualifies for reduced company car taxation in Germany. Only half the gross list price is used as a basis when calculating the monetary benefit from private use of the company car.The new BMW X1 xDrive25e features acoustic pedestrian protection as standard. When driving electrically at speeds of up to 30 km\/h, an unmistakeable sound designed specifically for electrified BMW models is generated to alert other road users to the approaching car without impairing the acoustic comfort of the vehicle occupants. In addition the standard equipment of the compact SAV with plug-in hybrid drive also includes 17 inch light alloy wheels, 2-zone automatic air conditioning as well as auxiliary air conditioning. The interior can be pre-conditioned remotely via BMW Connected using a smartphone. As an alternative to the basic version, the new BMW X1 xDrive25e is available as a Sport Line, xLine and M Sport model. In addition to the respective equipment packages, virtually all options of the conventionally powered BMW X1 are available for the plug-in hybrid model.The positioning of the high-voltage battery underneath the rear seats not only leads to a very low centre of gravity, which optimises the agility of the BMW X1 xDrive25, but also to a slightly reduced transport capacity compared to the conventionally powered compact SAV model variants. The 450 litres luggage compartment volume is fully available in primary use. With a standard split of 40: 20: 40, the folding backrests enable this to be increased to 1,470 litres. A trailer tow hitch with detachable ballhead is optionally available for the new BMW X1 xDrive25e. The maximum trailer load is 750 kilograms.\n"}

The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team and the newly developed endurance version of the BMW S 1000 RR enjoyed a successful debut in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC). At the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet (FRA), rider trio Kenny Foray (FRA), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Julian Puffe (GER) battled for the podium down to the wire. After 311 laps, they crossed the finish line in fourth place, just four seconds behind the top three. Team ERC Endurance, with riders Mathieu Gines, Julien Da Costa and Louis Rossi (all FRA), secured a BMW podium. The BMW customer team claimed third place overall with the previous version of the RR which is already known in the FIM EWC. The 83rd edition of the Bol d’Or kicked off the 2019\/20 FIM EWC season, which the newly formed BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is contesting as a works team for the first time with the new RR. The development of the endurance version of the motorcycle for the FIM EWC started just a few months ago. This year’s Bol d’Or had to be stopped between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. due to extremely bad weather with rain and storms, meaning that the actual race duration was just around twelve hours instead of 24. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team caused a stir with the new RR early on. On Thursday, Mikhalchik set an interim new lap record for the FIM EWC at Le Castellet on Thursday, with a time of 1:53.669 minutes. The qualifying sessions, in which reserve rider Bastien Mackels (BEL) was also in action, ended on Friday with a terrific fourth place on the grid for the #37 RR. When the race was interrupted on Saturday evening the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team was in seventh place. The #37 RR then restarted the race on Sunday morning from that position. In drying conditions, Foray, Mikhalchik and Puffe soon moved up into the top three, and the #37 was even in second place for a long time. However, a technical problem arose in the final phase which prevented closing rider Mikhalchik from defending the almost-certain podium. Just a few minutes before the chequered flag, Gines on the #6 RR, who also set a new race lap record at the Bol d’Or, overtook Mikhalchik to move into third place. The Ukrainian ended up crossing the finish line in fourth place, just four seconds behind Gines. The Tecmas BMW GMC team also finished the Bol d’Or in the top ten. Camille Hedelin, Alexis Masbou and David Perret (all FRA) finished in ninth place with the #9 RR. 15th place overall and fifth place in the Superstock class went to the GERT56 by GS YUASA team with Stefan Kerschbaumer (AUT), Lucy Glöckner (GER) and Pepijn Bijsterbosch (NED). Quotes after the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It was a turbulent opening race with a very good result. There has never been a Bol d‘Or like it. On one hand, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team faced an additional challenge since we did not to find a good rain set-up for the chassis and electronics in the run-up. Ilya also had his first ever experience of Dunlop rain tyres in the race. In this respect, the interruption suited us. On the other hand, as a totally new project it might have benefitted us that the team and bike weren’t subjected to the usual pressures of a full 24-hour distance. But overall, it has to be said that with our speed, the pit stops, the team performance and also in terms of fuel consumption, we were on track. That shows that we have developed a super basis in the short time available. Yes, we were gifted a few places by the problems the top teams experienced, but that’s all part of 24-hour races. Toward the end of the race, we struggled with a minor technical problem which cost us the podium by four seconds. It would have been amazing, but to come away with a fourth place is still remarkable. Congratulations to our customer team ERC, who overtook us eight minutes before the end of the race, thereby securing the spot on the podium.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The conditions really were difficult. It was the first time that we competed here, and I honestly never dared believe that we would be up there at the front. It was clear that we only had problems with the rain. Second place would have been possible, but we had a minor technical problem in the final hour of the race, which is why, unfortunately, we only finished in fourth place, with a deficit of four seconds on the podium. I’m happy about what we achieved, but I’m also slightly disappointed that more wasn’t possible. But, we are a new team and this race makes us optimistic looking to the future.” Kenny Foray: “It’s a new team, a new bike, and given these circumstances our result is really good. We only just missed out on the podium because we had a technical problem in the closing stage. That’s why I’m a little bit disappointed. Everyone in the team did a fantastic job and they deserved the podium. But that’s all part of endurance racing and we will continue to grow.” Julian Puffe: “The team worked night and day over the past few weeks to be competitive here, and with fourth place we achieved a great result. My two team-mates did an amazing job, and it’s a fantastic result for our debut in the FIM EWC. Obviously, we would have liked to finish on the podium, especially when it was so close. But on the whole, we can be very pleased.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I’m really happy that we finished the race. I didn’t expect that we would even have been fighting for the podium! It’s a brand-new bike, so we were aware that we might experience a technical problem over such a long race distance. We saw here how strong the bike is and how well the team works. It was really unfortunate that there was a problem in the end. That’s why my pace slowed down. But overall I am happy that we were able to get so close to the podium.” Bastien Mackels: “It was a real pleasure to join the team because the atmosphere is really unbelievable. It is one of the best teams I’ve ridden with so far. The BMW S 1000 RR is easy to ride and competitive. It’s a great project and I am convinced that the time will come and the team will fight for the win.” Mathieu Gines (Team ERC Endurance): “I’m over the moon. The bike was really good and the team did a perfect job. My team-mates were brilliant, and I also gave it my all. It was so much fun. Thanks to Team ERC Endurance and to BMW – I hope that I can compete in many more races with them.” \n"}

{"prompt":"Limitless reserves for high-altitude flights of fancy – with the new MINI Cooper SE over the Transfăgărăşan through the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. A journey that is a tough assignment for many conventionally powered vehicles proves to be a bagatelle for the first local zero-emission MINI. Lots of hillclimbs and some spectacular downhill descents through Europe’s most beautiful natural landscape with a difference in height of more than 1400 metres. ->","completion":" Munich. Let’s be honest, the driver and co-driver were super keyed up and extremely excited when they got into their electric MINI Cooper SE in Căpățânenii Ungureni, an idyllic little village in Romania. The three-door automobile emits a characteristically synthetic murmur to signal the readiness of its systems and the invisible T-shaped rechargeable battery located in the floor of the car permits a range of “250 kilometres” according to the charge level indicator. Really? Here, on the steepest ascent to a pass in Romania? Eccentric English automobile maniac Jeremy Clarkson from England calls the Transfăgărăşan “the best road in the world” in the cult automobile series “Top Gear” – and overcomes the difference in altitude of more than 1400 metres with a maximum gradient of 8.6 percent in a powerful super sports car. But now the electric cult small car is following in the tracks of the gang from Top Gear – does it have what it takes?Absolutely! The Transfăgărăşan mountain road in Romania that winds through the Transylvanian Alps for 90 kilometres is just the job for the battery-powered MINI Cooper SE – just presented to a public audience at the IAA Frankfurt 2019. The fact is that electric cars and high-altitude mountains are a perfect fit, like mountains and valleys. The perfect road-holding of the MINI Cooper SE combines with an almost ideal weight distribution of 54:46, and its low centre of gravity thanks to the underfloor rechargeable batteries transforms the battle of the curves on innumerable spectacular hairpin bends into a veritable pleasure garden. Furthermore, the electric motor provides ultimate traction by applying its 135 kW\/184 hp directly to the road through the front wheels thanks to the automatic transmission and model-specific torque of 270 Nm. This is already obvious to the crew immediately after the first few curves. And it becomes even more evident as time goes on. The Transfăgărăşan road unfolds second by second, becoming wilder and ever more dramatic. The car hurtles over viaducts and through tunnels, hurries past waterfalls and jagged scree-covered slopes.After the first 30 kilometres of road with scenic panoramas and thrilling dynamic driving, it’s time for a break. Not for the MINI – but for the crew! They take a detour from the smooth road surface into a quaint mountain village. This is where the tracks become typically Eastern European and virtually impassable – undoubtedly a problem for some cars designed in Western Europe but all cool for the MINI Cooper SE. In spite of the battery units, the car is only 145 kilograms heavier than a MINI Cooper S, thanks to the significantly lower weight of an electric motor by comparison with a petrol power plant.Are the cows along the side of the road likely to be impressed? This is an area where horse-drawn carts are still common and superannuated tractors make fast cornering into a slalom artform. Such a performance is indeed a rarity in this region – and the four-legged spectators stare after the MINI with an inquiring curiosity.In one hairpin bend, the MINI Cooper SE passes a flock of sheep within stroking distance. The engine purrs so quietly that you can hear the baas of the woolly sheep. Any worries that one of them will suddenly bump into the SE’s yellow front trim? No chance, the outstanding manoeuvrability and the braking assistant are absolutely trustworthy. If one of the animals happens to become bold as brass, we are at the ready – human and machine in rare harmony. There are plenty of parking spaces in the car park by the barrage wall of the Vidraru Dam, and the scenery presents an invitation to chill out. The crew gets a picnic basket out of the boot – just as spacious as its petrol relatives with capacity of between 235 and 731 litres (when the back seats are folded down) – and produces some memorable photos capturing the mountain panorama with mist rising up – in fact of course made up of clouds. Not for nothing is the Transfăgărăşan called the “road in the clouds”.Shortly before the top of the pass at an altitude of 2042 metres, the outside thermometer of the MINI Cooper SE shows a temperature of just a few degrees above zero – a good reason for care or to drive slowly? Not likely, there’s no risk at all, even if you floor the accelerator. The actuator-operated wheel-slip limiter reliably prevents the front of the car from swerving if the drive wheels start spinning.Inside the poorly lit Bâlea Tunnel, it’s gloomier than Dracula’s coffin but the daylight LED headlamps of the MINI Cooper SE banish any ghosts and dark thoughts. After crossing over the pass, spectacular downhill slopes mean that recuperation is so robust that the battery is almost fully charged by the time they reach the valley. This is because most of the electricity used for the ascents can be recuperated on the descent. The driver is able to decide how much is recuperated because the driver can toggle a button in overrun mode with two settings to define the strength of recuperation and hence the effect of the brakes during recuperation – an innovative feature that is typical and exclusively MINI.When the MINI Cooper SE reaches the romantic city of Sibiu, formerly Hermannstadt, it’s time to turn back after more than 90 kilometres of challenging journey up hill and down dale. The battery isn’t even half empty and after it has been fully charged, the crew sets out on the return trip to enjoy lots of driving fun. One thing has become obvious to the team in the car. A trip over this distance was easy peasy for the MINI Cooper SE. Other return trips easily within its range would include Hamburg-Travemünde in one go.\n"}

The BMW PGA Championship at the Wentworth Club, on the outskirts of London, is one of the most prestigious golf tournaments on the international calendar and attracts world-class golfers and tens of thousands of spectators every year. As the tournament celebrates its 15th anniversary with BMW as title partner, Championship Director Jamie Birkmyre looks back on the impressive development that the European Tour’s flagship event has undergone since BMW came on board in 2005.“I was handed the crown jewels,” says Jamie Birkmyre, referring to the moment in 2005 when he was named Championship Director of the PGA Championship, which was held under the BMW banner for the first time. Today, 15 years later, one thing is certain: Together, BMW and the European Tour have given the crown jewels a new splendour.“The standards set by BMW are the highest you can possibly achieve,” says Birkmyre, looking back to the start of the partnership. “BMW brought in a style that was so consistent with the way the automobile manufacturer produces its fantastic cars. Every detail is first class, there is no compromise.” This approach was applied immediately to the BMW PGA Championship, which has been improved consistently every year since. “BMW raised the level and, at the same time, every party involved raised their own level,” says Birkmyre.The flagship event of the European Tour has established a status that makes it the role model for other tournaments. “The BMW PGA Championship is the benchmark: A stunning venue, world-class players, heritage, and partners with prestigious, world-league brands. The golf is the nucleus, and we build around that pillar to give our fans the best experience possible.”The spectator experience is the focus of the organisers. With great attention to detail, they have continuously raised the bar every year – from the Championship Village and the celebrity Pro-Am, to the spectacular weekend concerts that complement the golfing experience for the fans.Birkmyre describes this development: “This is not just about a golf tournament, let’s make this a festival. With the BMW PGA Championship, we are in the entertainment business. It started with the Pro-Am. Let’s not have a Pro-Am like any other, let’s have celebrities. Then we added the concerts on the weekends. This year, with Rudimental and Anne-Marie on the stage, we will attract a lot of people who have never been to a golf event before. They are coming for the music in the first place, and may return for the golf.”Day one of the 2019 BMW PGA Championship proved that this approach is still extremely successful: On Wednesday, 22,000 people came to the celebrity Pro-Am at the Wentworth Club. “This is probably a world record for a Pro-Am,” says Birkmyre.

Cobalt is a key component in the production of batteries for electronic devices and electrified vehicles. Most of the global cobalt reserves and production are located in the south of the DR Congo.The companies from the electronics, automotive and chemical industries have therefore commissioned the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH to test within three years how living and working conditions in artisanal cobalt mining and in the surrounding communities can be improved. The commissioning companies will not operate the mine. Together with authorities in the province of Lualaba, the project has selected a legal artisanal mine site nearby Kolwezi to pilot the approach.“Sustainability is an important aspect of our corporate strategy and plays a key role in expanding electro-mobility. We are fully aware of our responsibility: Cobalt and other commodities must be extracted and processed under ethically responsible conditions,” emphasizes Dr. Andreas Wendt, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Purchasing and Supplier Network. The company’s commitment to projects such as \"Cobalt for Development\" is fundamental to ensuring that suppliers also consistently comply with the BMW Group’s high social and environmental standards. “If the project is a success, these approaches can be transferred to other small, non-industrial mines over the long term,” said Dr. Wendt.Dr. Hans-Ulrich Engel, Chief Financial Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE said: “BASF is committed to a responsible and sustainable global supply chain for cobalt. Although BASF does not procure cobalt from artisanal mines, we actively support \"Cobalt for Development\" as it aims to look for new ways to improve the sustainability of the supply chain. This project also contributes to the goals of the Global Battery Alliance of which BASF is a founding member. Cooperation with partners along the value chain drives change and increases the impact at all stages in the production.”During the upcoming months, the pilot project will focus on analyzing occupational and environmental risks to develop and implement responsible mining practices. Local partners such as the artisanal mining cooperative will participate from the beginning in developing and implementing these measures to strengthen local ownership and sustainability of the approach. In the nearby community, the focus will be to improve access to education, as well as financial literacy and alternative incomes for its residents. At the official launch of \"Cobalt for Development\", representatives of the financing companies met with the Governor of Lualaba Richard Muyej Mangeze Mans and Secretary General of the National Ministry of Mines Joseph Ikoli Yombo Y’Apeke. The event in Kolwezi was also attended by representatives of the civil society and private sector.The progress of \"Cobalt for Development\" is regularly evaluated internally and by a committee of local representatives to continuously improve the project approach. These lessons learnt could then form the basis if project measures are extended to other mine sites. The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH is a federal enterprise with worldwide operations in the field of international cooperation for sustainable development. For the \"Cobalt for Development\", GIZ collaborates with IMPACT, an international non-governmental organization that specializes in improving natural resource governance, and Good Shepherd International Foundation \/ Bon Pasteur, an organization with longstanding community development experience in the area. Media contacts: BASF SE Christine HauptPhone: +49 621 60-41040Email: Christine.Haupt@basf.comBMW Group Kai Zöbelein, Sustainability CommunicationsPhone: + 49 89 382-21170Email: Kai.Zoebelein@bmw.de Andreas Klugescheid, Vice President Governmental Affairs, Sustainability CommunicationsPhone: +49 89 382-23661Email: Andreas.Klugescheid@bmw.deAbout BASFAt BASF, we create chemistry for a sustainable future.

Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) has his next assignment in a BMW race car at the beginning of October. The BMW works driver will contest the penultimate round of the 2019 Italian GT Championship season at Mugello (ITA) with BMW Team Italia from 4th to 6th October. Zanardi will share the cockpit of a modified BMW M6 GT3 with BMW Motorsport Junior Erik Johansson (SWE) and Stefano Comandini (ITA). Zanardi has very special memories of Mugello. He contested the Italian GT Championship finale there back in 2016. It was his debut in the BMW M6 GT3, and he celebrated a victory cheered on by the whole paddock in the Sunday race. Now, Zanardi returns to Mugello with the BMW M6 GT3 and Italian team principal Roberto Ravaglia’s BMW Team Italia. “We’re really looking forward to competing with Alex again at Mugello,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “The emotions of his win there three years ago are still very real to us all, as are the many impressions that his guest start at the 24 Hours of Daytona in January left on us. It’s great to see him at the wheel of a BMW race car again, and we’re confident that the weekend at Mugello will be fantastic.” “I’m really looking forward to the weekend at Mugello, for many reasons,” said Zanardi. “For one thing, it has been a few months now since my last race at Daytona and I can’t wait to get behind the wheel again. BMW Team Italia managed by my old friend Roberto Ravaglia is also like a second family to me – as are the engineers at BMW M Motorsport, who have been close by my side for many years. Now we are all returning to the track together. And last but not least are the memories of the win in 2016, on my debut in the BMW M6 GT3. It was an unforgettable and indescribable weekend. I already know that I will enjoy the preparation and race at Mugello from the first to the final moment.” Unlike in 2016, when two sprint races were held at the finale and Zanardi was the sole driver of the car, this time it is a three-hour endurance race. That is why Zanardi will share the cockpit with the two regular drivers Johansson and Comandini, who are contesting the entire season for BMW Team Italia. The BMW M6 GT3 will be specially modified by BMW M Motorsport engineers. The continuously developed systems that enable Zanardi to race have been perfected further based on insights from the 24-hour race at Daytona (USA). Zanardi will also drive without prosthetic legs at Mugello, since this proved to be the ideal option for him. He will brake using the hand braking system fitted in the BMW M8 GTE at Daytona. This will be combined with the standard pedals in the BMW M6 GT3 that Eriksson and Comandini use. Zanardi’s steering wheel with gas ring is also familiar from his GT appearances and his DTM guest start at Misano (ITA) last year. The steering wheel will be changed during the driver change. The modifications to the BMW M6 GT3 also include the fully-automatic centrifugal clutch, which worked well at Misano and Daytona. This system has the major advantage for Zanardi that he doesn’t need to operate a clutch level with his hands as well. The software for the handbrake, steering wheel and centrifugal clutch will be adapted to the requirements of the Mugello appearance. Zanardi has already tested with the car. It’s intensive weeks for the Italian, as between testing the BMW M6 GT3 and the race weekend and Mugello there has been another highlight on his schedule: the 2019 UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships at Emmen (NED). Zanardi continued his amazing success story in the world of para-cycling in emphatic fashion and won two gold medals and one silver medal. Zanardi took gold in the team relay with the Italian national team on Wednesday and in Friday’s time trial – securing his paracycling world titles numbers 11 and 12. He was also second after an incredibly close finish in the road race. “I obviously travelled to Emmen with great expectations, but these results probably exceed even my optimistic goals,” said Zanardi. “I am very proud, particularly of the world champion’s jersey, which I won in the time trial, as that is one of the toughest races of all. I gave it my all in the road race too. It went fantastically and everything was perfect, including the final corner, when I was still leading the race. In the end, however, Tim de Vries was simply stronger than me. He deserved the win and I am very proud of my second place.” Zanardi’s results in Emmen proved once again that he is one of the very best in the world of paracycling. His goal is to qualify for the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo. This coming weekend, however, Zanardi will focus on another of his passions: triathlon. On Saturday, 21st September, he will compete in the ‘Ironman Italy Emilia-Romagna’ at Cervia (ITA). Last year, he set a new world record at the event with a time of 8:26.06 hours, the fastest time ever recorded by a triathlete with physical disabilities over the Ironman distance. On Sunday, Zanardi will then contest another triathlon over the half Ironman distance at Cervia. \n"}

Things are getting serious for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team. The fledgling project kicks off its debut season in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) with a 24-hour classic, the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet in the south of France. Kenny Foray (FRA), Julian Puffe (GER) and Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) will alternate on the #37 BMW S 1000 RR. Bastien Mackels (BEL) will be the reserve rider. The 83rd Bol d’Or gets underway at 15:00 on Saturday 21st September and finishes 24 hours later on Sunday afternoon. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team sees BMW Motorrad Motorsport expand its works commitment with the new BMW S 1000 RR to incorporate the FIM EWC. The #37 RR is based on the Superbike used in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) and features a number of modifications required for its outings in endurance racing. These include a larger tank, a rapid refuelling system, and quick-change systems for the wheels. The electronics have been adapted to meet the demands of the FIM EWC, while the engine is designed for durability and efficient fuel consumption. The start number, 37, is derived from Steven Casaer’s company EMC37, which has enjoyed success on the endurance circuit for many years. As Technical Coordinator of the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, Casaer will play a key role in any future success. Two weeks ago, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team attended the official Bol d’Or Pre-test at Le Castellet. Team Manger Werner Daemen’s outfit worked with the three riders to continue the development of the RR for the FIM EWC, and used the two test days to establish and coordinate procedures at the racetrack. The Bol d’Or is one of the best-known and iconic 24-hour races in the world. As well as the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team’s new #37 BMW S 1000 RR, a further six RRs will be fielded by BMW customer teams. Quotes ahead of the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “After a short but very intense period of preparation, we cannot wait to kick off our first season in the FIM EWC with the Bol d’Or. Werner Daemen’s entire team, Dunlop and BMW Motorrad Motorsport have done an outstanding job in recent months to prepare the BMW S 1000 RR for the opening round. The new RR for the FIM EWC is still in the early stages of its development, and the team is very much a fledgling project. As such, our goal for the weekend is to use the Bol d’Or to optimise the bike under the extreme conditions faced in a 24-hour race. We know that anything can happen during a race that lasts twice around the clock, even with experienced and renowned FIM EWC teams. We want to finish the race and, in doing so, to gain as much experience as possible, which can then be used in future work. Our debut season is intended as a learning year, during which we aim to improve step by step.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The waiting is finally over and the whole team is looking forward to the Bol d’Or. It is rather special when a classic like this forms the first race for a young project like ours. We will face many challenges, as it is still all new to us. However, we have made good progress during our preparations and are well equipped for the first race weekend with our new RR. Our three riders have shown at the test that they are already happy on the bike and can set fast times. However, we are not assuming that we will be able to claim top results from the word go. We are the new boys in the field, which means it will be a success if we come through without any major issues and see the chequered flag after 24 hours. It would obviously be great if we could also get a good result. We then want to continue our learning process in the subsequent races.” Kenny Foray: “The Bol d’Or 24-hour race is a very special race for me. I am hoping for a good result. The bike is fantastic and the team is doing a superb job. Everyone is very professional. I believe we can also challenge for a good result. However, everything is new and we will need a little time to really understand and optimise the full package. I think we can gather a lot of data. The first test was very good, everything worked superbly and we worked well together. I am now excited to see what awaits us at the Bol d’Or.” Julian Puffe: “The Bol d’Or will certainly be a big challenge for us all. We are a totally new team. The bike is brand new and we still don’t know how it will behave over the full 24 hours. It will all be a big test. I am mega motivated. As riders, all we can do is try our best and push as hard as possible for 24 hours. Then we will see what we come away with. However, with this package and the new team, I think a great result is possible.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am really looking forward to our first race with the new team and to this new challenge. The test went very well. We are a good team and had good pace, although we were not yet at 100% during the test. We obviously want to get the best result possible. We will try to finish as far up the field as possible. The race is very important to us. My goal is to ride a good pace all weekend and to enjoy my outing on the factory bike.” \n"}

It allowed the Ford to get passed but he recovered and got the job done. Although we had a good pace, the Ford was just better today. You usually get the breaks in traffic when you are leading your class and you don’t when you are second or third. Now, it’s on to Petit Le Mans and work begins to finish the season just as we started it, with a victory.”John Edwards (#24 BMW M8 GTE, 2nd place): “It feels great to be back on the podium and be back in contention, especially after the previous races where we struggled with our pace. We regrouped, made the necessary changes to the cars and they paid off. Last year, our sister car won here on a great fuel strategy so it is satisfying to be able to compete with the same pace as the other teams.”Jesse Krohn (#24 BMW M8 GTE, 2nd place): “Good day overall. Slight hiccup during my stint when I lost all power and that ultimately cost us the lead and may have cost us the win. It’s tough to know here because traffic plays such a big part but if you are the first car going through the traffic you most likely gain so losing that lead early-on was a bad blow for us. Overall, the team executed very well, the car was working pretty well and we came away with P2. Considering the issue we had, we can be very happy with our result.”Tom Blomqvist (#25 BMW M8 GTE, 5th place): “Very close at the end and to come so close to the podium and not get the result is a bit disappointing. The guys did a great job this weekend but the Corvettes just managed to get by at the end. Connor did a very commendable job keeping them at bay as long as he did and that helped John and the entire team.”Connor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M8 GTE, 5th place): “It was a difficult race with tyre degradation issues at the end. I was just trying to hold off the Corvettes at the end but I just could not keep them behind me long enough. We were able to hold them off enough to give the #24 car a good gap and keep it on the podium however. I am very happy with our effort and now we will try to get both cars on the podium at Petit Le Mans.”\n"}

René has performed very well throughout the season and deserves to be the champion. After a good team result yesterday, today’s race performance really was unsatisfactory – from the unnecessary collision between Sheldon and Timo to Marco’s retirement. Qualifying was really tight but we weren’t in the same position as on Saturday. Finishing eighth, ninth and tenth in the race is not enough. We must prepare perfectly for Hockenheim, as we want to round off the season with a good result.” Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“In qualifying, we were able to place the cars in a pack. However, there were a few incidents and technical problems during the race. After yesterday’s result, we had hoped that today would go a similar way. We had worked hard to achieve that but we didn’t get the right result. However, we will forget about that and look ahead to the next race weekend at Hockenheim, where we definitely want to put on a good performance.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 8th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 3rd, 182 points):“The opening phase was good and we were mixing it up with the Audis, however we didn’t have the pace to make more progress.

Now we are just focusing on Hockenheim.”Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 7th, Race: 9th, Driver’s standings: 13th, 37 points):“Finishing ninth after this race shows that it could have been possible to record a better result today, but that wasn't possible after the incident on lap two, which is very unfortunate. At Hockenheim, I will now do everything I can to finish this difficult season with a good result.” Bart Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“Philipp Eng moved up to eighth after starting from eleventh on the grid. He did as well as he possibly could and it was a similar story for Joel Eriksson. Looking at the pace of Sheldon van der Linde, I think that he could have been within striking distance of a decent result. However, his race was effectively over after that drive-through penalty.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 11th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 5th, 144 points):“Of course, that is not a dream result but it's the best we can do at the moment.

At least that did pay off a bit.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 13th, Race: 11th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 51 points):“It was quite difficult today. The first lap in particular was especially messy. Overall, it was a hard weekend for us.

{"prompt":"BMW Group Classic is celebrating the 60th anniversary of the MINI brand with a film screening and a presence styled in the period of the International Motor Show 1959 in the halls of the “March Motor Works” – Maria Costello and Troy Corser will line up at the start of the race for the Barry Sheene Memorial Trophy.  ->","completion":" Munich. BMW Group Classic has choreographed its appearance at the Goodwood Revival 2019 as a journey through time back to the year 1959. The occasion for this jubilee is the 60th anniversary of the MINI brand and a gala celebration in the parkland of Goodwood House in Southern England from 13 to 15 September. Since 1998, the estate of the Earl of March in West Sussex has been the annual showplace for a stylishly spectacular event celebrating historic motor sport. Racers from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s along with celebrity drivers recall the fast laps on the Goodwood Racing Circuit at the sporting competitions that took place regularly in this setting between 1948 and 1966. In keeping with the historic vehicles and the authentically styled ambience, many of the visitors contribute to the classic atmosphere of this event by wearing outfits in the style of the period.The year in which the classic Mini made its debut and the Swinging Sixties that followed are the focus of a wealth of attractions away from the race track. A number of feature films are being screened in the revival cinema at the venue. A highlight is “The Italian Job” from 1969 in which three Mini Coopers starred alongside Michael Caine playing the main parts in a sensational gold robbery involving a car chase through Turin.“March Motor Works”: New models from 1959 are presented in period style.Homage is also paid to the classic Mini as a screen hero in the halls of the “March Motor Works”. The documentary “The Incredible Seven” is being shown within the portals of a picture palace from the 1960s. The British Motor Corporation (BMC) commissioned the film in 1961 and it presents the story behind the creation of the classic Mini. Footage of test drives with early prototypes, conversations with the creator of the classic Mini, Alec Issigonis, images of the public debut of the revolutionary small car and driving reports by journalists give an insight into the initial years of an automobile that became a rolling legend over the many decades of its development, with faithful fans all over the world. The title of the film refers to one of the two official model designations under which the classic Mini was launched on the marketplace in 1959. It rolled off the assembly line in virtually the same guise as the Austin Seven and the Morris Mini-Minor. The Mini owed its doppelganger identity to the varied repertoire of brands marketed by BMC.Visitors can also go back in time 60 years in the other rooms of the “March Motor Works”. BMW Group Classic is staging its presentation of historic vehicles in the style of a stand at the International Motor Show in 1959 and the model range of that era is showcased there. Two examples of the BMW 700 coupé, a BMW 600 and a BMW Isetta with “Lufthansa” livery, embody the automobile spirit in the years of the economic miracle. The taxi version of a BMW 501 is presented in front of the building. Two models of the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud additionally provide luxurious grandeur and British flair. The models BMW R 69 S, BMW R 50 S and BMW R 27 represent the motorcycle range from BMW in 1959. Furthermore, the spectacle of a BMW 3\/15 PS takes onlookers 30 years further back down memory lane. The history of BMW as an automobile manufacturer began with this model 90 years ago.The “Revival Festival” is another perennial element in the firmament of BMW Group Classic at Goodwood. Visitors can enjoy Bavarian specialities in a historic festival tent and experience a hint of Oktoberfest atmosphere in the British Isles.Barry Sheene Memorial Trophy: Title defender Troy Corser lines up at the start again.Last year, Australian racing rider Troy Corser succeeded in achieving a historic success for BMW Motorrad Classic together with Herbert Schwab. The duo won the overall standings in the race for the Barry Sheene Memorial Trophy on a supercharged BMW R 57 Compressor for the first time at the Goodwood Revival. For his title defence race, two-time Superbike World Champion Corser has selected a BMW R50 Kaczor. This version of the BMW R 50 is characterised by increased power and reduced weight. Ferdinand Kaczor was a designer who subsequently became a BMW engineer and he achieved some spectacular successes on many race tracks in the 1960s.British racing rider Maria Costello is battling for the coveted trophy astride a second motor-sport legend on two wheels. She is riding a BMW RS 54. The machine was presented in 1954 and it was the first motorcycle designed specifically for racing by the BMW brand. Even today, the motorcycle’s powerful Boxer engine driven by a vertical shaft ensures that the BMW RS 54 can achieve an impressive performance on any race track.\n"}

Munich. To mark the trade fair premiere of the new MINI Cooper SE , the BMW Group presents the latest outcome of its electrification offensive at the 2019 International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt am Main. The first purely electrically powered series-production model in the 60-year history of MINI made its way to its debut using its own virtually noiseless, locally emissions-free power. With project manager Elena Eder at the wheel, the new MINI Cooper SE proved on its premiere run that electric mobility in the unmistakeable style of the British premium brand doesn’t have to be limited to day-to-day urban traffic.At the start, the standard navigation system of the new MINI Cooper SE indicated exactly 400 kilometres as the distance for the journey from the BMW Group headquarters at Petuelring in Munich to the main entrance of the exhibition grounds in Frankfurt. So it looked as if a single stopover to recharge the lithium-ion battery ought to be sufficient to ensure that the journey to the trade fair debut was locally emissions-free. After all, the model-specific high-voltage battery with its gross energy content of 32.6 kWh, positioned deep in the vehicle floor, enables a range of 235 to 270 kilometres. And the ideal place to refresh the car’s energy reserves was suggested on the on-board monitor in the central instrument: a fast charging station on the A3 motorway.“Urban mobility is certainly the greatest strength of the MINI Cooper SE. But that doesn't mean that electric driving fun is only suitable for short distances,” says project manager Eder. “The MINI Cooper SE can easily cope with lengthier journeys thanks to the option of using DC fast charging stations with a charging capacity of up to 50 kilowatts. A lunch break is all it takes to recharge.”When the car was charged on the way to the IAA, there wasn’t even time for dessert. Within just 35 minutes, the high-voltage battery – which had previously been almost fully depleted – was charged to 80 percent of its total capacity. This meant that there was more than enough power on board to tackle the second stage of the trip without any worries. In order to maximise efficiency, use wasn’t made of the car’s maximum speed of 150 km\/h. Nonetheless, the 135 kW\/184 hp electric motor of the new MINI Cooper SE was able to demonstrate its spontaneous power delivery on one or two courageous overtaking manoeuvres.Finally, the MINI Cooper SE rolled into Hall 11 of the Frankfurt exhibition centre with sufficient residual range: here it is now due to be presented to IAA visitors from 12 to 22 September 2019. Meanwhile, the standard charging cable provides fresh energy for further excursions from a conventional socket. Alternatively, MINI ELECTRIC offers flexible options for charging the high-voltage battery. The charging connection of the new MINI Cooper SE is designed for both AC and DC charging using Type 2 and CCS Combo 2 plugs. The battery can be charged either at a MINI ELECTRIC WALLBOX or at a public charging station with a maximum output of 11 kW within two and a half hours to 80 percent; a 100 percent charge takes three and a half hours.The MINI Cooper SE will be produced at the British MINI plant in Oxford as of November 2019, after which the brand's first electrically powered vehicle will be delivered worldwide. In Germany, the new MINI Cooper SE will be available at prices starting at EUR 32,500 (incl. 19% VAT). \n"}

BMW Group Thailand is marking another historic milestone with the inauguration of a local high-voltage battery production plant in partnership with the DRÄXLMAIER Group, one of the world’s leading automotive suppliers and a partner of BMW Group since 1966. BMW Group Thailand launched the local assembly lines in July 2019 at the DRÄXLMAIER Group plant in WHA Chonburi Industrial Estate 2. The high-voltage battery assembly plant is assembling both battery modules and the battery itself.Mr. Uwe Quaas, Managing Director of BMW Group Manufacturing Thailand said: “One of the pillars of BMW Group’s global strategy is electrification, and BMW Group Manufacturing Thailand is underlining its commitment to this mission by taking another big step forward in our electro-mobility strategy. The start of local battery production enables us to better respond to growing domestic demand for electrified vehicles in Thailand. This new capability also strengthens the performance of Plant Rayong in fulfilling the country’s mission of sustainable mobility.”Mr. Gerhard Irnesberger, Plant Director DRÄXLMAIER Group Thailand, said, \"It is a major honor for us to be entrusted with the production of high-voltage batteries for BMW Group Thailand. Our company sees itself as a reliable BMW partner in the regions in which we operate. We have long experience in offering the most innovative solutions for premium vehicles in the fields of electrics, electronics, interior design and battery systems. With 53 years of supplier partnership at the global level, we are very pleased to expand our alliance and partnership with BMW Group Manufacturing Thailand.”To ensure that the production process meets the BMW Group’s exceptional standards of quality, experts from BMW Group Munich were involved in the process at the new DRÄXLMAIER Group facility throughout the process in order to set up a solid foundation for the future. The high-voltage battery is a central element of partially and fully electrified vehicles and a highly sophisticated component that requires specialized skills to produce. Thanks to the advanced training and qualification programs initiated in September 2018, the staff from the DRÄXLMAIER Group who have participated in the battery production training program at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing - the BMW Group Competence Center for e-drive production – and the BMW Group pilot plant for e-drivetrains in Munich, are now ready for the high-tech assembly work to produce the latest generation (Gen4) of the BMW Group high-voltage batteries This involves the use of cutting-edge production technologies onsite including laser welding, plasma activation, robotics, gluing, automated optical and electrical inline quality inspection along with end-of-line testing. The training is also focused on supporting a highly automated process, which is an important part of battery module production, as well as comprehensive quality assurance, product methodology and technology, rework, and analysis.Equipped with a strong grasp of battery production skills, the staff will work on battery cells provided by a supplier in the Asian region along with other imported parts – such as aluminum housing, electronics, and cables – to roll out high-voltage batteries that meet BMW Group’s world-class standard and are in full compliance with Thailand’s local content requirement regulation. Final batteries will then be transported to Plant Rayong for the production of the entire range of BMW 5 Series Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles, which has been in operation since July 2019. Since 2017, BMW Group Manufacturing Thailand has assembled four BMW plug-in hybdrids at Amata City Industrial Estate, Rayong province.Following on from BMW Group Thailand earlier endorsement for incentives by Thailand’s Board of Investment (BoI) for a 700 million baht outlay in BMW plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) production, the company has jointly invested with DRÄXLMAIER Group in this battery assembly plant, worth 500 million baht. This new beacon for e-mobility innovations will further unlock the competence of Thailand’s automotive industry. The incentives from BoI also symbolize the unity between the public and private sectors in this undertaking towards a sustainable future.\n"}

What concerns the next generation most is climate change. Therefore, it also concerns us at the BMW Group. That’s why we are clearly committed to the Paris Agreement and the UN Global Compact since 2001. We are focusing on the question: Which technologies have the greatest leverage to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions? This applies to the automotive industry, but also to all other industries with a CO2 footprint. For us, it’s about having a real effect or as we would say in German, „Wirksamkeit“. And that means on the basis of scientific knowledge and technical data. The deciding factor is the actual contribution to climate protection. A product can only be purposeful if a customer wants it, desires it, and uses it. Hence, we are focusing on: What will our customers – who are all citizens of this planet – want in the future? What kind of drivetrains, technologies and services?And how do we achieve, at the same time, the best result for climate protection? Here, at our stand, you will see a wide range of options for our customers, because we believe in the power of choice – not only today, but also tomorrow. Now, let’s take a look at electric mobility: How will demand for purely electric vehicles develop in the next decade in the major world regions? It will remain mixed, for quite some time, due to the differences in infrastructure, driving distances and political frameworks. Moreover, we expect substantial growth in the premium segment up to 2030. The BMW Group is a global company, and we are able to offer all possible drivetrains, on flexible and, also in some cases, on purpose-built architectures.That means:• Conventional engines with benchmark performance in emissions• Fully-electric and plug-in hybrids• And in the future, also fuel-cell vehicles. Our flexibility enables us to fulfil all customer needs and be truly customer-centric. This puts us in a very strong strategic position to tackle at the same time the challenges of future mobility and climate change. Ladies and Gentlemen,We are already right at the forefront of electro-mobility.For example:Here in Germany, no other car company has sold more electrified cars in 2019 than the BMW Group. And in Norway, three out of every four BMW Group vehicles sold are electric vehicles. Therefore, we are certain: In two years’ time, we will have sold over one million electrified vehicles. Most importantly, for us, sustainability starts way before customer interaction takes place. Our strength at the BMW Group has always been how we manage the entire value chain. Take the BMW iX3, with our fifth generation e-drive system:• We will not use any rare earths in the eDrive.• Our cobalt is purchased directly from mines in Australia and Morocco.• And our electricity in production is mostly covered by renewable energy sources. In Europe our production is already carbon neutral. Electric vehicles can only make a real contribution to climate protection when the entire value chain is sustainable. As we have announced earlier, by 2023, we will have 25 electrified models in our portfolio. Half of those will be fully electric. Alongside fully electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids are an effective way to reduce emissions sustainably. They are the perfect solution for customers who want to drive emission-free in cities, and want to have ease of mind for longer trips. Fuel cell technology could also be a real solution for long distances in the future, and of course, we are working on this intensively. In 2022, we will be launching a fleet of fuel cell vehicles. Here, at our stand, you can see the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT Development Vehicle. We expect to see an increase in demand for this technology in the second half of the next decade. And we will be ready with an offer for our customers, should they request it. Ladies and Gentlemen,With us, innovative technology has always been coupled with emotional design.Both of these vision vehicles, the iNEXT and M NEXT perfectly embody this principle. Moreover, today, we are delighted to present the world premiere of a new design highlight. And now I would like to ask Adrian van Hooydonk, our Head of BMW Group Design, to tell you more about that. Thank you. Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design:Presentation of the BMW Concept 4. Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG:Ladies and Gentlemen,These Concepts show the innovative strength of the BMW Group in technologies, in design and in flexibility. The concept for the new 4 series, here, will also be the basis for the future BMW i4, which will be available starting in 2021. The BMW i4 will offer customers the joy of our sporty DNA, combined with pure electric power. Because we believe in the power of choice: Diverse drivetrains, for diverse customers, all over the world. The BMW Group is a great company, with strong and fascinating brands. And I am very proud to lead this outstanding team. We are a responsible corporate citizen. And we are very clear about how we are moving forward. Furthermore, we will continue to inspire our customers over the next generations with solutions that are customer-centric, effective and purposeful. For us, this is the NEXT GEN. Thank you for coming. And thank you to everyone watching online. \n"}

New face in BMW i Andretti Motorsport’s driver line-up: for Season 6 of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship, Maximilian Günther (GER) will represent the team. The 22-year old contested his first Formula E season as a rookie last year – and impressed. The BMW i Andretti Motorsport team also bids farewell to António Félix da Costa (POR).New addition Maximilian Günther contested ten races for GEOX Dragon in 2018\/19, finished in fifth place twice and was involved in the Super Pole competition for the fastest six drivers in qualifying twice. Günther is no stranger to BMW Motorsport having begun his career in single-seater racing in 2011 in the Formula BMW Talent Cup – BMW’s youth development programme at that time – and finishing second. He followed that with various levels of single-seater racing. “I am looking forward to Maximilian Günther returning to the BMW family,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “We followed his performance last season very closely. Maximilian regularly managed to get the maximum out of his car package. That saw him achieve some impressive results. Having a driver with a history of BMW single-seater racing is a great fit.”“It is fantastic to be part of BMW i Motorsport now,” said Günther. “BMW i Andretti Motorsport had a strong maiden season in Formula E, won the very first race and was involved in the fight for the title down to the wire. That is why this switch is definitely a fantastic step for me. It is great to compete for BMW again. That’s where everything started for me in single-seater racing in 2011.”Marquardt commented on the farewell to Félix da Costa: “I would like to take this opportunity to thank António very much for the good collaboration this past Formula E season and in the six years overall as a BMW works driver in the DTM, the WEC, in GT racing and in Formula E. We had a great time together but agreed that a change would be good for both parties. Now we wish him all the best on his new journey.”“I have always been happy and proud to be part of the BMW family,” said Félix da Costa. “BMW Motorsport gave me the opportunity to drive many different race cars, and to learn an incredible amount. I would also like to thank BMW i Andretti Motorsport for a great and intense time together in Formula E. Although I am now moving on to face new challenges, I will always look back fondly on my time at BMW.”The second BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver alongside Maximilian Günther in Season 6 will be announced in the coming weeks before the official test drives at Valencia (ESP) in October. \n"}

Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) wrapped up the successful defence of his title at the seventh, and penultimate, round of this season’s International German Championship (IDM) at Assen (NED). Mikhalchik bagged another brace of wins at Assen on the new BMW S 1000 RR, run by alpha Racing-van-Zon-BMW, meaning he can no longer be caught at the top of the championship standings. “The whole weekend was perfect, as we were first in every session and won both races,” said Mikhalchik. “I am delighted, and winning the title ahead of the final race is not bad either. We worked really hard this year and won more races than last season – and we still have another two races to come. It’s nice to be able to approach them in a more relaxed fashion, and I’m looking forward to the end of the season at the Hockenheimring.” BMW racers have dominated this season’s IDM. Mikhalchik is followed in second and third place in the Riders’ Championship by team-mate Julian Puffe (GER) and Pepijn Bijsterbosch (NED \/ Team Dutch Comfort Houses). BMW had already secured the IDM Manufacturer title at round six at Most (CZE). The RR also claimed further podium finishes in both of the weekend’s races at Assen.

The Smiths Racing rider was one point outside the all-important top-six in the championship ahead of the trip to Oulton Park. Although he crashed out of race one, two eighth-places in races two and three earned Hickman enough points to make him one of the six riders who will battle it out for the title over the final three events of the season. “Practice and qualifying went really well and I was confident I could finish in the top-six in race one,” said Hickman. “The fact that I failed to finish due to a crash, which was not my fault, was a big disappointment. That made the second race difficult, as I had to start from way down the grid. However, we pulled ourselves together in race three and it is fantastic to be back in the Showdown again. I’ll be giving it my all at the last three race weekends.” Christian Iddon (GBR \/ Tyco BMW) finished fifth and seventh in the first two races, but crashed in race three. Team-mate Glenn Irwin (GBR) was seventh, 15th and eighth. In the Superstock class (BSB STK), Taylor Mackenzie (GBR \/ Bathams Racing) claimed another podium. He finished third in class in the second of the two. Mackenzie had previously come home sixth in race one. MotoAmerica: BMW racers in action in New Jersey.

We started off in a strong position for Tom and also a good position for Markus but we couldn’t consolidate that; we slid back in the pack. It was difficult to hold position. The same problem we had in the sprint race we then had in the second main race. It has been lack of grip, edge grip, and we really struggled with both Markus and Tom today. We know that we need to go and look for the chassis balance. For sure we know about the speed deficit but the big issue at the moment is to find more mechanical grip. If we succeed in this and find more mechanical grip, which will be more from the chassis and suspension, then I think we can make another step forward. But today in these hot conditions and in a race condition where you have 20 laps you really feel the effect of that. Unfortunately both riders struggled throughout. We could see that when we do have grip, when we have a qualifying tyre on, Tom is probably one of the fastest riders on the grid. This highlights that if we can introduce more grip in race tyre conditions then we will have a much better pace in the race. That is something what we have learned again this weekend and we will work hard to improve that for the next rounds.” Tom Sykes: “It has been a bit difficult and obviously in race conditions we saw that we have some more work to do. Today we had some quite extreme race conditions and as a result collected some good data. In the last race we made a few changes to the BMW S 1000 RR, which helped us to move forward and the race itself has given us a lot of information and a clear point where we are lacking and where to try and improve. Having said that, we certainly have some positives to take away from this weekend in terms of track performance. A big thanks to the whole of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team; we’ve had quite an intense few days testing here a few weeks back and here at the race weekend so credit to them, we will keep working and hopefully get to where we want to be in a few weeks’ time at Magny-Cours.” Markus Reiterberger: “We tried a little modification in the warm up. It felt positive but we knew that we should not be fooled since in the cooler mornings the grip is always better and our bike works really well then. Unfortunately, we struggle more and more the warmer it gets. We were able to use the soft tyre in the Superpole race but I finished only 14th so it was not a good race. For the second race, we made another change and the feeling was great. The start was good, but maybe I was a bit too cautious in the first two corners and lost a few places. But then I was able to set good lap times and keep in touch with the group but I just could not get past Michael Ruben Rinaldi. We are still lacking a bit of acceleration and power.” \n"}

Saturday at Portimão (POR) was a day of mixed feelings for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK team. After a strong performance in Superpole with second place for Tom Sykes (GBR) and ninth for Markus Reiterberger (GER), the afternoon's race did not go to plan. Reiterberger crossed the finish line in twelfth place, with Sykes just behind in 13th position. Portimão is hosting the tenth round of the FIM Superbike World Championship 2019 (WorldSBK). Sykes was able to make good use of the faster qualifying tyres during the final minutes of Superpole, setting what was then the best time - with a new lap record of 01:40.483 minutes. It was only Kawasaki rider Jonathan Rea (GBR) who managed to go one better and claim pole position. Sykes claimed the second spot on the front row. Reiterberger also reached the top ten in Superpole, finishing ninth. Sykes initially dropped back after the start of the race but stayed in the leading group that was battling for podium positions, however the British rider fell on lap eight out of 20. He was able to remount and continued the race on his RR in 15th place. He proceeded to move up two places to 13th during the remaining laps. Reiterberger also lost a few places after the start. He then gave a solid race performance, crossing the line in twelfth position. Quotes after race one at Portimão. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Both riders did very well in Superpole. Tom obviously made a great lap with his qualifier and second position was fantastic. Markus held on to the third row of the grid in ninth which again was a solid performance from him. The race was difficult. Tom got away well, he was in a real strong group and he was faster on some parts of the circuit while he was slower in other parts. The places where he was struggling on speed was where the passing places were at the end of the start-finish straight. He suffered badly for that and he was overriding and because of that he lost the front. But he took the good decision to get back on the bike and finish the race to collect some data. He scored more points but most important we got good data for tomorrow. Markus’ start was not so bad but then he got sucked in and dropped two places into the first corner. From that position it was a lonely race for him and as the race tyre disintegrates as the laps go on he got slower and this unfortunately was the position he finished. But we will analyse today’s data, work hard, prepare for tomorrow and hopefully secure places in the two front rows in the Superpole Race.” Markus Reiterberger: “Superpole was really great. With the SC-X tyres I managed to reach the top five for a time before ending up in seventh before everyone had put on their qualifying tyres. I was then able to record a fast second lap after the first one with the qualifying tyres. That was a perfect lap. I had expected to be on the second row but it was ninth place in the end. I was just two and a half tenths of a second off fourth place. The start went well enough but I hit the first two gears too early and that meant that the other riders were able to out-accelerate me. Then I rode my race and struggled a bit with the problems that are still holding us back somewhat. I finished twelfth, which was just shy of my aim of a top ten position, but we will see if we can find something to help me do a bit better tomorrow.” Tom Sykes: “Overall, it’s a shame because we have found a good set-up for our BMW S 1000 RR and we’ve been really consistent throughout practice and also in Superpole. We had a very strong result and just missed pole position by only one tenth. So this was good but unfortunately during the race our set-up was really good to ride when I’m on my own but when I was with the other guys the style of riding had to change a bit. And while we have a good set-up we still miss a little bit of straight-line performance. On our own we are not too bad but unfortunately I got caught out riding with the guys and just this slight change in style caused me losing the front when I released the brake. I was a little bit disappointed but it was a big lesson learned. Now we will work on that and change the set-up for tomorrow to attack again.” \n"}

{"prompt":"Right from the start, the classic Mini was a member of high society: royalty, film stars, musicians and celebrities from the world of fashion succumbed to the charm of the British original. To mark the brand's birthday, MINI presents a restored classic Mini in the striped design of the 60 Years Lifestyle Collection.  ->","completion":" Munich. John Lennon drove one, Peter Sellers roared through his detective comedies in one, and even the Queen was chauffeured through the park of Windsor Castle in one. Countless celebrities succumbed to the charm of the classic Mini, which was first presented to the public 60 years ago. The car’s distinctive design, surprisingly generous space and agile driving characteristics were all major factors in the revolutionary small car being accepted into the circles of high society at an early stage – especially in its home country of Great Britain. Exclusive photographs show numerous stars from the world of music, film and fashion choosing the classic Mini as their preferred means of transport, making it an icon of its time.To mark the brand's 60th anniversary furthermore, MINI is commemorating those glorious early years with some exceptional special vehicles. Following the successful market launch of the MINI 60 Years Edition for the current MINI 3-door and MINI 5-door, the classic Mini will once again be at the forefront. A unique, elaborately restored one-off in the colourful striped design of the current MINI 60 Years Lifestyle Collection revives the fashionable panache and lifestyle of the wild sixties.Even after the brand's relaunch in 2001, celebrities all over the world were soon enjoying the distinctive driving fun offered by the modern MINI, which followed firmly in the footsteps of its classic predecessor. As the first compact car for the premium segment, the MINI immediately became a trendsetter. Its unconventional concept has inspired film-makers, musicians, fashion designers and other artists alike. With its enormous popularity as well as a clear tendency towards extravagance and immense driving fun, the MINI has made several appearances in Hollywood films and found its place in the private fleets of numerous showbiz stars.The fact that the classic Mini was accepted into London society at an early stage was due to a member of the Royal Family: Lord Snowdon – photographer, designer, friend of Mini designer Alec Issigonis and the husband of Princess Margaret – was one of the first to buy the new small car. A family photograph taken in 1965 shows him with Princess Margaret and their son David on a tour of London in a Mini.Lord Snowdon paved the way to a royal weekend residence for the Mini as early as 1960: his sister-in-law, Queen Elizabeth, was chauffeured by Issigonis through the park of Windsor Castle. For the small automobile, this was something of a knighthood – the highest of royal honours that Issigonis himself went on to receive nine years later.In the years that followed, the Mini secured a firm place in the fashion, art and music scene of “Swinging London”. Its international fame was not least due to the enthusiasm it generated among all members of the Beatles. John Lennon ordered a Mini in 1964 – even though he didn’t have a driving licence. Historical photographs show drummer Ringo Starr with one of the Mini Cooper S models that took part in the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally and Paul McCartney getting into his private Mini in 1967. Guitarist George Harrison was the proud owner of a Mini de Ville, refined by renowned bodymaker Radford. When the Beatles met in 1967 to shoot their TV film “Magical Mystery Tour” at West Malling Airfield in Kent, John Lennon also enjoyed racing across the airfield in a Mini painted in psychedelic colours.The affection of well-known musicians for the classic Mini lasted for decades, and it was by no means limited to the British Isles. While the popularity of the Mini became an increasingly global phenomenon, pop and rock bands from the US gained new fans in Europe. In 1966, it was the Beach Boys who set off on an international tour with their surfer sound, posing in front of a Mini Moke in Great Britain. This image of the Californian musicians with a beach mobile bearing the band’s name spread around the world. The American band, The Monkees, reached the peak of their popularity at about the same time. There is a photograph dating back to this period in which guitarist and singer Michael Nesmith and his girlfriend Phyllis are looking up through the folding roof of a Mini into the camera above. Like Beatle Harrison, Monkee Nesmith had his own personal Mini Cooper S made by Radford. This extravagant and expensive one-off specimen not only had a folding roof but also a 100-hp engine and a wooden dashboard with additional instruments.As well as to enjoying driving the classic Mini, London-born musician David Bowie was particularly impressed with its parking capabilities. He firmly believed there was no other automobile designed so perfectly for city life. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the original, Bowie designed a classic Mini in 1999 that reflected its entire surroundings – like a polished teapot made of British silver. German singer Nina Hagen was also photographed with a Mini Cooper for the magazine Paris Match in the French capital in 1994.Sometimes as an extra, sometimes in the leading role – the classic Mini has appeared in television series and feature films spanning six decades. It makes an appearance in the 1966 cult movie “Blow Up” as well as in the crime comedy “Kaleidoscope” of the same year, in which the then still largely unknown Warren Beatty played the leading role. The film “A Cœur Joie” starring Brigitte Bardot also came out in 1966: it features fashion models travelling in the Mini Cooper. The fact that French star Bardot had a close connection with the British car in her private life as well is demonstrated in photographs taken in 1980 in which she can be seen accompanied by her dogs in a Mini Moke.“The Bionic Woman” was a TV series that enjoyed considerable popularity in both the USA and the UK. In 1976, leading actress Lindsay Wagner posed in London in front of a classic Mini attached to a steel frame, giving the impression she was lifting the vehicle with one hand – apparently possessing superhuman powers like her character from the TV series.The scenes in which the classic Mini was used by British actor Peter Sellers and director Blake Edwards, were similarly unconventional and humorous. Sellers and Edwards made the film “A Shot in the Dark” in 1964 as a sequel to the crime comedy “The Pink Panther”. As Inspector Clouseau, Sellers drives a rather unusual Mini Cooper – here the actor was also demonstrating his off-screen penchant for extravagant special versions of the classic Mini. The film vehicle is a Mini de Ville made by Radford featuring a wickerwork design on the flanks of the body. Over the years, Peter Sellers acquired about a dozen individually enhanced classic Mini vehicles, including one he gave to his then wife Britt Ekland as the contents of an oversized birthday cake presented to her at the Radford sales premises in London in 1965.Probably the most spectacular big-screen appearance of the classic Mini was in the 1969 gangster comedy “The Italian Job”. In this film, crook Charlie Croker played by Michael Caine joins forces with an accomplice to plan a gold theft in the centre of Turin. They load their booty into three Mini Coopers – painted red, blue and white – before setting off on a breathtaking escape through a sewer tunnel and over roofs and stairs in the midst of the traffic turmoil in the Italian city. 34 years later, “The Italian Job” was to hit cinemas again: in the new version featuring Hollywood stars Charlize Theron, Jason Statham and Mark Wahlberg, the story of a spectacular gold theft was staged in even more effective and high-speed style. When it came to casting the leading four-wheeled stars, the choice fell – how could it be otherwise – on the new MINI Cooper S, which now demonstrated its agility and sporty flair on and under the streets of Los Angeles.In the Swinging London of the 1960s, not only were new musical sounds emerging but also the stylish trends of the fashion world – and the classic Mini was always right at the heart of the action. Lesley Hornby – better known by her nickname Twiggy – passed her driving test in a classic Mini in 1968.Mary Quant, influential women's fashion designer and inventor of the mini skirt, was also inspired by the classic Mini. Shortly after obtaining her driving licence, she ordered a black Mini and later designed a special edition – recognisable by its black and white striped seat covers, among other things. The British designer also took a liking to the new MINI: “It's a fashionable, cheerful and smiling car.”At the end of the 1990s, Paul Smith, one of Britain's most famous men's fashion designers, created a limited special series of the classic Mini with a paint finish in a shade of blue created by himself to match the anthracite-coloured alloy wheels. Another unique edition at least as popular as this was presented for the 40th anniversary of the classic Mini, which Smith painted in his typical multicolour striped design. \n"}

The team has developed an endurance version of the RR, which is based on the Superbike that competes in the FIM World Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). At the two-day test in the South of France, development of the endurance bike continued. Quotes after the test at Le Castellet. Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “The test went very well. We had two minor falls on the second day but these things can happen. Overall, we were able to test a lot of things here at Le Castellet, and all riders were pretty fast. We are happy and I think that we are well prepared for the race.” Kenny Foray: “It was a really good test for us. The bike was performing well from the word go. My team-mates and me completed many, many laps with the two test bikes. We also tried many different things and were able to find a good base set-up. I am very happy with these two days of testing. I’m really looking forward to the race at the Bol d’Or because I’m sure that we can do something really good.” Julian Puffe: “These two days of testing were really good. It was the first encounter of the team, the bike and the tyres. And I have to say: the team works perfectly together. At the beginning, the bike was of course very different for me compared to the bike I ride in the IDM but step by step I got used to everything. There are for sure some things I still have to adapt but I’m really happy with how the test went. Everything is still new but after this positive first shakedown, I’m already looking forward to the race in two weeks’ time.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “It was a really positive test. We have completed a lot of laps and tested everything. The two test bikes had different set-ups we worked with to step by step increase the confidence. We also did a race simulation during which I set my fastest lap time on used tyres. This makes me confident for the race in two weeks’ time. But overall we did not focus on lap times but more on the race pace. They way the team works together is really great. Everything went perfectly well and I think that we are ready for the first race.” \n"}

Two BMW works drivers will line up at this year’s FIA GT World Cup on 16th and 17th November in Macau (CHN): Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Joel Eriksson (SWE). Farfus will once again take the wheel of the BMW M6 GT3 of BMW Team Schnitzer at the world-famous ‘Guia Circuit’, where he won last year. Eriksson will compete in the FIST-Team AAI BMW M6 GT3. For Farfus and BMW Team Schnitzer it will be an emotional return to Macau. The driver and team are connected by a long and successful shared Macau history. BMW Team Schnitzer is the record winner on the legendary street circuit – and Freilassing (GER) team took one of those wins with Farfus in the FIA Touring Car World Championship in 2009. 2017 saw Farfus contest the FIA GT World Cup in Macau in the BMW M6 GT3 Art Car fielded by BMW Team Schnitzer. This was followed by a very special victory last year: it was the last race event for Charly Lamm as Team Principal of BMW Team Schnitzer. Farfus won the qualifying race on Saturday and drove to a start-finish victory in the main race on Sunday. Lamm said it was one of the greatest moments of his racing career after the win. He passed away just a few weeks later. “Macau will be very special this year,” said Farfus. “Firstly, it is a place of which I have a lot of great memories. And the win in the FIA GT World Cup last year was a highlight of my career. Winning together with Charly, my friend and my mentor, who was very close personally to me and my family, was something really special. This year I hope we can repeat the success in memory of Charly. We know that it will be a real challenge, but we will be racing there for the third year in a row with the BMW M6 GT3 and have picked up the necessary experience. We will try our best and give it our all to be successful again.” “On the initiative of Charly Lamm, BMW Team Schnitzer contested its first race outside Europe in Macau many years ago,” explained Team Manager Herbert Schnitzer jr. “That’s why Macau is a very emotional place for us. Also because things came full circle last year with our win in Charly’s last big race. We always love being in Macau and have a special relationship with this track. This year we will give it our all and hopefully bring home as great a result as last year, even though the competition is very strong. We are really looking forward to competing there with Augusto again. He is a long-standing companion of our team, we have a fabulous relationship with each other and really appreciate each other. His experience is also incredibly important. He has been in Macau with us so often, so it’s great that we have him on board.” Eriksson’s debut in the BMW M6 GT3 in Macau. BMW DTM driver Eriksson is also familiar with the tricky track in Macau’s urban canyons. He raced in the Formula 3 Grand Prix there in the last three years. Now he will contest the FIA GT World Cup alongside FIST-Team AAI in the BMW M6 GT3. The Taiwanese team last competed in Macau two years ago and finished in fifth and sixth places. This season, FIST-Team AAI is enjoying success in the China GT Championship and the China Endurance Championship. “I am absolutely thrilled to be going back to Macau again this year, this time representing BMW Motorsport in the FIA GT World Cup,“ said Eriksson. “I have fallen in love with the Guia Circuit during my visits in Formula 3 and I simply can’t wait to take it on in the BMW M6 GT3. I thoroughly enjoy working with all the guys at FIST-Team AAI. It’s hard to know what to expect. I’ve only ever driven an F3 car at Macau so a certain level of adaptation will be required, but I’m honoured that BMW has decided to put its trust in me for one of the most important races of the season.” The Macau Grand Prix, under the umbrella of which the FIA GT World Cup takes place, will be held for the 66th time this year. It is one of the best-known race events in the world. The race weekend also includes the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix, in which BMW Motorrad Motorsport racers have celebrated victory multiple times and numerous podiums in recent years. \n"}

During the test, we certainly gathered a lot of information for the set-up of the BMW S 1000 RR. Overall at the test, we tried various bike set-ups that we’re not usually able to do during the race weekends due to the restricted time which proved very, very good. We got some positive results, so hopefully we can pick up where we left off and try to keep our run of podium places on the go. The podium is certainly the target for the remaining races.” Markus Reiterberger: “I was very happy with the two days of testing at Portimão. I am now looking forward to a good, and hopefully successful, race weekend. I am looking forward to good teamwork and want to improve and enjoy my riding.

With the forthcoming races on the Nürburgring the current German Touring Car Masters (DTM) season will finally reach its decisive phase. Moreover, during the DTM weekend being held from 13 to 15 September 2019, visitors can expect a further attraction. The BMW M4 Edition \/\/\/M Heritage will make its world debut on the legendary racetrack in the Eifel. The special edition of the BMW M4 Coupe, which forms the basis of the BMW M4 DTM deployed by BMW M Motorsport, fascinates with an exclusive exterior and interior look reflecting the impressive tradition of the high-performance racing cars. The BMW M4 Edition \/\/\/M Heritage, powered by a 331 kW\/450 hp straight six-cylinder engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology will be produced and sold worldwide between November 2019 and April 2020 as an edition model limited to 750 units.Light blue, dark blue and red – these are the colours by which motorsport fans immediately recognize the BMW M GmbH logo. Immediately after the founding of the BMW Motorsport GmbH in 1972, the characteristic colours already adorned these racing cars, which were based on the BMW 3.0 CSL and became highly successful in touring car racing. Since then, the distinctive stripes in the three classic BMW M GmbH colours have stood for exhilarating performance and exclusive design also on the road. The BMW M4 Edition\/\/\/M Heritage takes up this unmistakable colour combination on unique exterior and interior design features. There is a choice of the three body colours Laguna Seca Blue, Velvet Blue metallic and Imola Red available for the edition model. Furthermore, the two-seater’s carbon-fibre reinforced plastic roof boasts a striking decorative strip in the BMW M colours, which is integrated into the CFRP composite at the factory using a special manufacturing process. Likewise unique are the forged, 20-inch M light alloy wheels in a star spoke design featuring the colour Orbit Grey matt and fitted with mixed tyres. The interior of the edition model is also characterised by an exclusive selection of colours and materials. The spectrum of equipment includes model-specific full leather M seats in a bicolour design and with prominent openings within the area of the seatbacks. Each seat colour is oriented towards the exterior paint and is complemented by partly bicoloured contrast stitching. In conjunction with the exterior colours Laguna Seca Blue and Velvet Blue metallic, the seats come in Silverstone\/Black with turquoise stitching or Velvet Blue and Orange respectively. With the exterior finish Imola Red, the seat colours Red and Black correspond with yellow and red contrast stitching.The both appealing and exclusive colour scheme continues with interior carbon trim strips designed exclusively for the BMW M4 Edition \/\/\/M Heritage and whose CFRP structure incorporates the stripe design featuring the three characteristic M colours. Both the interior trim strips and the door sills bear emblems with the imprints “Edition \/\/\/M Heritage” and “1\/750” as an indication of the limited edition of this model. The lettering “\/\/\/M Heritage” – in turquoise, orange or red respectively – is also to be found on the front headrests. The BMW M4 Edition \/\/\/M Heritage offers a particularly exclusive opportunity to experience the handling characteristics of a high-performance sports car marked by dynamics, agility and precision. At the same time, with this model, the BMW M GmbH is continuing the tradition of exclusive special editions, a tradition that has been cultivated now for several model generations. They reflect the enthusiasm for exceptional sporting successes or awareness of the history of selected models, of which many have become much sought-after collectors’ items in the course of time. Expressive paint finishes and a characteristic interior design were already hallmarks of the BMW M3 Edition of the year 2009. At that time, with the variants Alpine White, Black, Dakar Yellow and Monte Carlo Blue there were as many as four body colours available for the edition model based on the fourth generation of the BMW M3. In the year 2012, BMW Motorsport’s successful comeback in the DTM triggered the production of the BMW M3 DTM Champion Edition. During the first season following an almost 20-year break, BMW came first in the manufacturer’s rating, with the BMW Team Schnitzer winning the team classification. Moreover, the Canadian Bruno Spengler seized the driver’s title. Only 54 units of the edition model were produced – one for each racing victory BMW was able to clinch in the DTM by then. And there were several more in the years that followed. In the 2016 season, it was the German BMW Motorsport works driver Marco Wittmann in particular who was hard to beat and who eventually became the new DTM champion. The BMW M4 DTM Champion Edition, which was limited to 200 units, was brought to market in his honour. The strongly racing-oriented special edition not only exhibited exclusive design features but, above all, was provided with numerous innovations that had previously helped the 368 kW\/500 hp BMW M4 GTS achieve its outstanding performance.The same year, BMW M GmbH also presented an edition model of the BMW M3 Sedan in memory of the BMW M3, which had made its debut three decades previously. The special edition 30 Years M3 was finished exclusively in the colour Macao Blue metallic and produced in a limited quantity of 500 units. The latest example to date of a fascinating combination of performance and exclusiveness is the BMW M4 Convertible Edition 30 Years.

{"prompt":"BMW M Motorsport and the BMW DTM family send their best wishes on a notable birthday: DTM boss Gerhard Berger (AUT) turns 60 today. Since the start of his long career, the former Formula 1 driver and present ITR chairman has always enjoyed a close relationship with BMW. ->","completion":" Munich. BMW M Motorsport and the BMW DTM family send their best wishes on a notable birthday: DTM boss Gerhard Berger (AUT) turns 60 today. Since the start of his long career, the former Formula 1 driver and present ITR chairman has always enjoyed a close relationship with BMW. Berger contested his first Formula 1 race at the Österreichring (AUT) in 1984 – in an ATS-BMW. With Schnitzer Motorsport he enjoyed success in the European Touring Car Championship, and celebrated victory at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) with Roberto Ravaglia (ITA) and Marc Surer (SUI) in the BMW 635 CSi in 1985. That year also saw the Austrian drive his first full Formula 1 season in the Arrows with a BMW turbo engine. Berger’s first victory in Formula 1 followed in 1986, winning the Mexico Grand Prix in the BMW turbo-driven Benetton. After he ended his Formula 1 career in 1997, Berger started a new chapter with BMW and became BMW Motorsport Director in 1998. He held that role until 2003. Together with the dual leadership with BMW Motorsport Director Dr. Mario Theissen, he prepared BMW’s return to Formula 1. It was in that era that BMW also celebrated the overall win for the BMW V12 LMR at the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) in 1999. As ITR chairman, Berger has been directing the DTM’s destiny since 2017. Best wishes on Gerhard Berger’s 60th birthday. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director): “Congratulations Gerhard on your sixtieth, on behalf of the entire BMW Motorsport family! Gerhard Berger and BMW have a shared, successful past. It started in the 1980s, when Gerhard celebrated his first successes in racing and embarked on his impressive Formula 1 career with BMW turbo power. He went on to become BMW Motorsport Director, which makes him one of my predecessors. His tenure included the unforgettable Le Mans victory of 1999. We are delighted to be able to continue working with Gerhard in the DTM. He has made the DTM international within a very short time, by bringing Aston Martin to the series as a manufacturer and drawing up a calendar with half of the races in other European countries. And with his input into the regulations, Gerhard has ensured spectacular races and spectator proximity. He really is a fantastic person, and not just as a racing driver, but in everything that he takes on. I wish Gerhard health and fitness on his 60th birthday – that is the most important thing. That he maintains his drive, continues to challenge us in terms of a better DTM and stays who he is – a great guy…” Bart Mampaey (Team Principal BMW Team RBM): “I was 16 years old when Gerhard won the 24-hour race of Spa-Francorchamps with Charly Lamm’s team. It was after the Juma Racing era, my father’s team, which celebrated a lot of success in this race at that time. I also still remember the BMW 635 CSi really well, with which we won at Spa in 1983. We were always embroiled in a ‘duel’ with Schnitzer, and Gerhard competed for the team in 1984, alongside Roberto Ravaglia and Manfred Winkelhock. I still remember that Gerhard was incredibly fast in the winning year of 1985. It’s not a surprise given that he confirmed his skills later on by making it to the top of Formula 1, where he drove for teams like Ferrari and McLaren. I have a lot of respect for his career as a racing driver, and for everything else he has achieved, for what he represents as a person. After his active career, he enjoyed success not only in various roles in motorsport, but also as an entrepreneur. Then he joined the DTM, at a time not easy for the series, and set the course for a successful future. A very happy birthday to you Gerhard Berger!” Stefan Reinhold (Team Principal BMW Team RMG): “Firstly, congratulations on your special birthday. As a former fan, I naturally have huge respect for Gerhard. I have known him since he started out as a racing driver and am very impressed with what he has done for the DTM so far. It’s a lot of fun with him, and you can tell that he really is a full-blooded racer. And that is exactly the type of person we need in the DTM.” Marco Wittmann: “I’d like to wish Gerhard all the best on his special birthday. I first got to know him personally through the DTM, but of course I know everything that he did and achieved before that. He has definitely brought a breath of fresh air to the DTM, implemented a lot of innovations, like the turbo engines and Aston Martin joining the series. But he has also done a lot for the fans, for example, the Fan Area or the Fan Base in the paddock. A lot has happened. The series is being made more international. Overall, he has invested a great deal of time and effort. I hope that he stays with us in the DTM for a long time and continues to move it forward.” Philipp Eng: “Gerhard is an absolute legend in Austria, and not just from a sporting perspective. Anyone who thinks of Austria automatically thinks of Gerhard Berger and Niki Lauda. He has achieved an incredible amount in his life so far, and I feel that he is the right man to steer the big ship that is the DTM. All the changes to the regulations that he initiated, such as no tyre blankets, radio ban or Indy restart have borne fruit. I am happy that I know him, because he is a really laid back guy, a real Austrian. I wish Gerhard Berger all the best on his birthday, particularly health and a long life in which he celebrates many more notable birthdays. I would also like to wish him success in everything that he does. He is involved in a really wide range of activities, not only in the DTM. I wish him all the best with these.” Bruno Spengler: “Gerhard Berger is a very special person for whom I have a great deal of respect. As a child I always watched him on TV with my dad when he was in Formula 1. The fact that he is now the DTM boss makes us drivers really happy and we are very proud of that. He has made a difference in the DTM, triggered a lot of new things, new regulations, new cars. He is very dynamic and is a wonderful fit for the DTM. We are all really pleased that he is involved. Gerhard, I wish you a very happy birthday from the bottom of my heart.” Timo Glock: “I wish Gerhard Berger all the best on his birthday, good health and continued creativity, which he has. Gerhard is a person to whom you have always looked up – whether as a Formula 1 driver, team principal or now as the DTM boss. He is an absolutely fantastic person, and I am pleased that he has taken the reins of the DTM. The direction in which he has taken the series is very positive, particularly as far as the regulations are concerned. I think that the sport has become significantly better in recent years. I hope that Gerhard continues to have lots of great ideas and keeps on steering the DTM in the right direction.” Sheldon van der Linde: “All the best to the boss of the DTM, Gerhard Berger, on his 60th birthday. I think that he is the right man for this job, and all I can say is that I am very proud to be able to drive in a series in which Gerhard Berger has so much involvement. He is a real legend and has already done an incredible amount to keep driving the series forward. I am excited to see how things progress.” Joel Eriksson: “I would like to wish Gerhard Berger all the best on his special birthday. What he has done for the DTM and the championship is incredible. He does a tremendous amount to establish the DTM as one of the most successful race series in the world. I am very happy and incredibly proud to be part of this family. On that note: a very happy birthday.” \n"}

We’ve made quite a lot of changes on the electronic strategy, also changes with the suspension. It has given him a good race pace consistency which we have been looking for. So overall for Markus it has been a good test. Tom has come back very good on the second day of testing after he had two crashes on the first day. He has worked through some engine and electronic strategy and some rear linkage work. And overall to finish P3 on the afternoon of day two was a good comeback and we are in a good position for the races in two weeks.” Tom Sykes: “The first day wasn’t too easy with two crashes, but these things happen in racing. All the guys worked really hard and it looks like I gave them a little bit of work to do. But they have done a great job and the second day was really successful, we got a lot of information. I’m very happy with the set-up of the BMW S 1000 RR in these hot conditions. Looking at the lap time, it looks worse on paper than it actually is because everybody put different tyres on. In the end we got what we needed from testing, even with the small issues, and we are ready to go racing in a couple of weeks. I will for sure be aiming for the podium again.” Markus Reiterberger: “It feels good to be back on the bike after the long summer break. We completed a lot of laps and test a lot of new things on the electronic side and on the chassis side. It was really interesting and we found a few positive things for myself and I improved the feeling a little bit. My lap time was not bad, even if on the sheet it does not look so good we are not too far away from the front. We are only nine tenths of a second back and I’m sure it’s possible to improve for the next races. We will put the best package together for the races and I will try my best there. Generally, I’m happy with what we have done, it was a big job from the entire team who worked very hard. I really enjoyed riding the bike and want to say thank you to the whole team.”\n"}

Which means that they can provide valuable input for the development of the endurance version of the new RR, which we will continue to drive throughout the season. We want to become more competitive step by step in our first year in this top-class world championship. After this first year of learning, our long-term goal is to close in on the top and battle for the title.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team: “This is a totally new challenge for me.

So I was actively involved in the championship as a rider for 14 years and also finished on the podium during this time. I am delighted to now have this opportunity with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, even though it involves a lot of work and is nothing like the IDM. In the first year we need to start by gaining experience, even though our aim is always to finish races as far up the field as possible. I’m delighted that we have a strong trio of riders in Kenny Foray, Julian Puffe and Ilya Mikhalchik, and that they have been given the deserved opportunity to grow with this project. I am very optimistic going into the season.” Kenny Foray: “I am delighted with this new challenge in this new team. I have been part of the BMW family for several years now. My goal has always been to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans. And I would love to go home with the title as well. It goes without saying that we first need to get used to the new bike and continue to develop it, but it is an incredibly great motorcycle. Endurance is not easy, but I think that we will be able to be competitive early on. I have high expectations for this new season.” Julian Puffe: “I feel very honoured to have been given the opportunity to compete for a works team in the FIM EWC. I think it is every racer’s dream to ride in a works team at some point. Particularly in a series as top class as the endurance world championship. I am really excited for this new challenge. I have competed in endurance races since 2017. We won my first race in 2017, which was at the Slovakiaring. And we won the Superstock class at the Bol d’Or in Le Castellet last year as well. We followed this with third place at the Slovakiaring. So, my endurance races have always gone really well so far. Of course, this will be a new challenge, but my goal will always be to be as close to the front as possible. We have a really great team, which we can rely on. I have also modified my daily training in line with preparations, so that I am as fit as possible. I cannot wait for the season to get started.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “Firstly, I would like to thank BMW Motorrad Motorsport for this huge opportunity to compete in a world championship as a works rider. It means a great deal to me. I am the first Ukrainian to take their first steps on this huge world stage. I will give it my all from the very first race. The calendar includes three tracks that are new to me, and I am also really excited for the races outside of Europe. I am looking forward to being able to show my potential at such a high level. I am confident that we will do great things with the new RR and am looking forward to the first race.” FIM Endurance World Championship 2019\/20. 21st\/22nd September 2019: Bol d’Or \n"}

This year, De Phillippi shares the #25 cockpit with Tom Blomqvist (GBR). The race at VIR is the second GT class only race of the 2019 IMSA season with 22 cars entered from the GTLM and GTD classes this year. The green flag for the two-hour-and-forty-minute race falls at 1:35 p.m. local time on Sunday, 25th August. Quotes ahead of the race at Virginia International Raceway. Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “Obviously, we had a great race at VIR last season, scoring the first win for the BMW M8 GTE. I am optimistic about the event this year as we have been showing pace.” Tom Blomqvist (#25 BMW M8 GTE): “Virginia is another race track well suited to our car. I think we will be strong there. I like the layout of the track; it looks fun, we just need to eliminate all the little errors that have been compounding over the previous events and have a clean weekend. We’ll be looking to put the disappointment of the last round behind us that’s for sure.”Connor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M8 GTE): “VIR has a great combination of high speed and low speed sections, but also offers some great elevation change as well making it extra technical. Last year we proved to have a package capable of winning and I know we will have the same this year. Now we just need to execute.” John Edwards (#24 BMW M8 GTE): “VIR is a fun and very challenging track, and it’s the spot of the M8’s first win a year ago. It’s also my closest race to home so I’m hoping we can pull off another victory for BMW this weekend.”Jesse Krohn (#24 BMW M8 GTE): “I like the GT only races, especially at VIR. I prefer being the fastest class on track as you get to decide when and where to pass instead of trying to predict where a faster class car is going to dive bomb you. This combined with one of the best tracks on the calendar makes this the most enjoyable GT only race of the year.” \n"}

Anniversary mood under California’s sun. At the Monterey Car Week 2019 and the Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, MINI celebrated the brand’s 60th birthday with a review of its history and an outlook on the future. On America’s west coast, MINI presented a series of historically important vehicles and provided an initial look at two fascinating new models: the brand’s most powerful series vehicle ever produced and the first all-electric powered MINI. The new MINI John Cooper Works GP is currently undergoing the final phase of its series development process with high-speed laps on numerous racing tracks throughout the world, before being launched on the market in an edition limited to 3 000 cars during the coming year. The new MINI Cooper SE is anticipated with high degree of tension. Production launch is already scheduled for November 2019. Taken together, the two models represent the future bandwidth of the model range for the British premium brand – from local zero-emission mobility in city traffic, to thrilling performance on the race track.The prototype of the new MINI John Cooper Works GP already gives an inkling of the outstanding high-performance characteristics in Pebble Beach with its yawning air scoops, large alloy wheels, an independent design for the front and rear aprons and a striking roof spoiler. The impressive appearance is certainly not overstated. During test drives on the Nürburgring, the new extreme sports car in the MINI model range went around the legendary North Loop in less than eight minutes. This feat is powered by a four-cylinder engine packing more than 220 kW\/300 hp with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology under the bonnet. The new engine, the chassis technology developed with motor-sport know-how from John Cooper Works and the aerodynamically optimised body meld together to form a precisely tuned overall package for the exuberant race feeling.The MINI Cooper SE is significantly more understated than the new elite athlete but it presents an inimitable character. Subtle accents of colour in yellow, the shrouded hexagonal radiator grille, the absence of an exhaust system and lightweight alloy wheels tailored to the model highlight the sustainable drive concept of the electric vehicle based on the MINI 3-door concept. Driving fun in the MINI Cooper SE is typical of MINI and yet fascinatingly new. The spontaneous development of power generated by its 135 kW\/184 hp electric motor, a chassis tuned specifically for the model and the particularly low centre of gravity due to the high-voltage battery positioned in the vehicle floor give the vehicle exceptional agility and dynamic performance when cornering. In future, this means that electromobility can be experienced in the inimitable style of MINI.When the two new vehicles were presented in Pebble Beach, they were supported by a cast of exceptional representatives from the 60-year history of the brand. Alongside a Mini Cooper S from 1965 in contemporary rally trim and two special editions from the final production year of the classic Mini, the first-generation MINI John Cooper Works and the MINI E were also on display. The MINI E produced ten years ago in a small series already yielded important findings about the operation of electric vehicles in everyday situations. The experience gained in testing across the world was subsequently channelled into development of the electrically powered models of the BMW Group. The values of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and electricity consumption shown were determined according to the test procedure defined in the European Directive VO (EU) 2007\/715 in the version applicable at the time of type approval. The figures refer to a vehicle with basic configuration in Germany and the range shown takes account of optional equipment and the different size of wheels and tyres available on the selected model.

Here’s an overview of the evolution of the BMW Turbo engine in motor racing. ->","completion":" Munich. BMW is celebrating ‘50 years of Turbo Power in motorsport’ in 2019. From the first turbo engine back in 1969 to the latest P48 engine for the BMW M4 DTM, which already has six wins to its name this season, there have been many steps forward. Here’s an overview of the evolution of the BMW Turbo engine in motor racing. 1969: BMW 2002 TI – Engine: BMW M121.As the first BMW Turbo racing engine, this four-cylinder, in-line engine with a two-litre capacity and turbocharger was a history-making pioneer. Dieter Quester (AUT) won the European Touring Car Championship in a BMW 2002 TI with turbo power. With 0.98 bar of overpressure, the first generation of turbo engine generated approx. 280 hp at 6,500 rpm. The exhaust fan was theoretically capable of developing a boost pressure of 1.76 bar, however, the pressure in the cylinder would have been so great, that the cylinder head would have lifted clean off. 1976: BMW 3.0 CSL – Engine: BMW M49\/4.The BMW 3.0 CSL art car designed by Frank Stella (USA) raced at the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) in 1976 with the BMW M49\/4 turbo engine. With a displacement of 3.2 litres, the boost pressure of 1.72 bar allowed the engine to generate roughly 750 hp at 9,000 rpm. It took the BMW Motorsport engineers a matter of weeks to assemble a test car, which made its race debut at Silverstone (GBR). However, as with the art car at Le Mans later, technical issues prevented a good race result. 1977: BMW 320 Group 5 – Engine: BMW M12\/12.From 1977, Schnitzer Motorsport ran the BMW M12\/12 engine in the BMW 320 Group 5. Just one year later, Harald Ertl (AUT) won the German Racing Championship with that very engine. The four-cylinder unit generated just short of 400 hp, while a variant developed further by Paul Rosche and his team in 1979 actually exceeded the 500-hp mark. 1979: BMW M1 Group 5 – Engine: BMW M88\/2.In 1979, an impressive 1,000 hp of power lay dormant in the BMW M88\/2 engine for the BMW M1 Group 5. The mid-mounted engine could not really unleash this power until 1981, as the homologation of the car was delayed. By that point, the BMW M1 Procar, which was homologated in line with Group 4 regulations, had already achieved great fame with the M88\/1 naturally aspirated engine. However, the Group 5 version brought with it advantages over the rivals from Porsche and Ford, who were very strong at the time. These benefits ultimately helped Hans-Joachim Stuck (GER) to a prestigious victory at the Norisring in 1981. 1981-1987: Brabham BMW – Engine: BMW M12\/13.Based on the engine in the BMW 320 Group 5, Paul Rosche developed the 1.5-litre engine used in the Brabham BMW in Formula 1 in 1981. The unit initially generated roughly 560 hp in races, but this performance was increasing all the time. In 1982, Nelson Piquet (BRA) claimed the first Formula 1 victory with BMW Turbo Power. One year later, he was crowned world champion in the Brabham BMW BT52. By this point, its engine was generating 640 hp in race mode, with 2.9 bar of boost pressure. Its successor – the BMW M12\/13\/1 – was capable of up to 1,400 hp in qualifying mode, making it the most powerful Formula 1 engine ever. As a customer engine, it was also used by other teams, including ATS, Arrows and Benetton. Current ITR boss, Gerhard Berger, took his maiden Formula 1 victory with this engine in 1986. 2011-2012: MINI WRC and BMW 320TC WTCC – Engines: P14 and P13.After the Formula 1 era, it took until 2011 for BMW Motorsport to run another turbo engine: the P14, based on the production engine in the Mini Cooper S, in the Mini Countryman World Rally Car, and P13 in the BMW 320TC for the FIA World Touring Car Championship (FIA WTCC). The power was increased dramatically, to 320 hp from a displacement of just 1.6 litres. The cylinder block and cylinder head were largely unmodified, showing just how robust the production engine was. 2016: BMW M6 GT3 – Engine: BMW P63.In 2016, the BMW M6 GT3 was the next race car to compete with turbo power. The P63 engine was based on the S63 production version and was slightly modified to meet the demands of motorsport. Thanks to M TwinPower Turbo technology, the V8 engine with a displacement of 4.4 litres generated up to 585 hp, depending on the classification. The BMW M6 GT3 is still enjoying success with the P63 engine to this day. Among other successes, this combination has won the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) twice and the FIA GT World Cup in Macau (CHN). 2018: BMW M8 GTE ­– Engine: BMW P63\/1.In preparation for entering the FIA World Endurance Championship and the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with the BMW M8 GTE, the familiar engine from the BMW M6 GT3 was reduced from a displacement of 4.4 to 4 litres to comply with GTE regulations. The P63\/1 engine consists of almost 2,300 components – 985 of which are unique. 181 parts originate from production projects, while over 700 were developed from scratch especially for the P63\/1 or transferred to this project from other BMW Motorsport racing engines. Depending on the classification, it generates between 500 and 600 hp and was, at the time, the most efficient engine that BMW Motorsport had ever developed. Its greatest success to date came in the form of a GTLM class win at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) in 2019. 2019: BMW M4 DTM – Engine: BMW P48.On the 50th anniversary of the BMW Turbo engine, turbo power returned to the DTM in 2019. Like the 1969 engine, the BMW P48 is a two-litre, four-cylinder turbo engine, which is now capable of developing more than 600 hp with boost pressures of up to 2.5 bar. As the regulations specify a maximum amount of fuel, the detailed development work focussed primarily on efficiency. In this regard, it not only surpasses the P63\/1, but also most modern production engines. At 85 kilograms, it weighs only half as much as its DTM predecessor. The lightweight unit boasts impressive figures compared to the DTM engines used previously: half the displacement, more power, less consumption. The P48 engine won on its race debut at the 2019 season-opener at Hockenheim (GER). \n"}

A birthday celebrated with your close family looks somewhat different. Thousands of MINI fans from all over the world came together at the English port city of Bristol in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the British heritage brand. Once again, the International Mini Meeting 2019 was the diary highlight for the MINI community and more than ever before the event created a bridge spanning the past, present and future of the brand. The cars at the celebration include the first classic Mini ever built dating from the year 1959, the MINI 60 Years Edition produced in this current anniversary year and the MINI Cooper SE as the ambassador for local zero-emission driving fun of the future.The International Mini Meeting was launched in 1978 by German fans of the classic Mini. Since then it has developed into the world’s biggest annual event for the organised club scene and many others who express their passion for the original British small car at this gathering of like-minded enthusiasts. The unique mix of vehicle show, spare-parts and accessories market, driving activities, and festival atmosphere with live music and entertaining competitions reflects the close-knit community spirit of the event held in a different European country every year and its cosmopolitan flair.No journey is too far for the fans and many of them travel hundreds or even thousands of kilometres in their own vehicle. At each venue, lovingly maintained classic Minis are presented side by side with individually designed MINIs. At intervals of five years, the brand’s British homeland is the showplace for the International Mini Meeting – and this is also the case in the anniversary year, which reached another climax at the end of the meeting with the big Birthday Party.The year 2019 is an occasion for MINI to look backwards, while at the same time acting as the springboard into a new era. The MINI 60 Years Edition has been available for a few months now and once again this model highlights awareness for the long tradition of the brand alongside its British heritage. The exclusive design and equipment attributes of the Edition model define appealing accents for individual style, premium quality and athletic performance. In November 2019, production will get under way for the first all-electric powered model of the brand. The new MINI Cooper SE takes the go-cart feeling that is so typical of the brand to a new level, with an electric motor that generates 135 kW\/184 hp and the high-voltage battery positioned low in the floor of the vehicle. At the International Mini Meeting 2019, the MINI Community had its first opportunity to get to know the model developed on the basis of the MINI 3-door car, which is scheduled for production at the MINI Plant Oxford in the near future.The MINI Plant Oxford was also the starting point for the scintillating convoy of vehicles that arrived punctually to mark the beginning of the Mini Meeting 2019 in Bristol. The unique parade was headed by the first classic Mini ever built, followed by a convoy of unique vehicles from each production year, and with a model of the MINI 60 Years Edition bringing up in the rear. The procession provided an awesome spectacle for all the fans – or in the highest form of praise by a Bristolian for anything expressed in their inimitable dialect: “gert lush!” The values of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and electricity consumption shown were determined according to the test procedure defined in the European Directive VO (EU) 2007\/715 in the version applicable at the time of type approval.

{"prompt":"Fourth pole position of the season, followed by win number four: Marco Wittmann (GER) backed up his outstanding performances at Assen (NED) in Saturday’s race at Brands Hatch (GBR), where he guided the Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM to the sixth victory of the season for BMW M Motorsport.  ->","completion":" Brands Hatch. Fourth pole position of the season, followed by win number four: Marco Wittmann (GER) backed up his outstanding performances at Assen (NED) in Saturday’s race at Brands Hatch (GBR), where he guided the Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM to the sixth victory of the season for BMW M Motorsport. Wittmann made up ground on the leaders in the Drivers’ Championship, thanks to a 28-point haul. Third-placed Wittmann now has 146 points to his name, 32 fewer than championship leader René Rast (GER, Audi), who followed him home in second place. As well as Wittmann, Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) also finished in the points in sixth and eighth places respectively. Bruno Spengler (CAN, BMW Bank M4 DTM) and Timo Glock (GER, JiVS BMW M4 DTM) came home 12th and 13th. Glock was involved in a collision – through no fault of his own – at the start with Daniel Juncadella (ESP) and Jake Dennis (GBR, both Aston Martin), which resulted in him dropping to the back of the field. Joel Eriksson (SWE) was unable to start the race, due to a technical issue with the CATL BMW M4 DTM. The BMW Motorsport engineers and the team did all they could to solve the problem before the start of the race, but ultimately ran out of time. Reactions to the 11th DTM race of the 2019 season at Brands Hatch. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director): “That was really a superb race from Marco Wittmann. He put together a great lap in difficult conditions in qualifying to secure pole position. He then held his nerve after Paul di Resta took the lead thanks to a lightning-quick start. He decided early on to look after his tyres. After we decided to delay his pit stop a little, he drove fantastically on a clear track and opened up a lead, which he was able to defend comfortably through to the finish. He is gradually closing in on the leaders in the Drivers’ Championship. Philipp Eng and Sheldon van der Linde also put up a good fight and scored valuable points. Looking ahead to Sunday, it is now important to make more of our opportunities and score points with even more cars. I feel sorry for Joel Eriksson that he was unable to start today, however, we should be able to prepare his car optimally again for tomorrow.” Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“We had a ridiculously good Marco in the car again. The unsettled weather made this morning’s qualifying very exciting. The guys all did a superb job. Unfortunately, Bruno Spengler and Timo Glock were a little unlucky at the start of the race. There was some contact, without which they would definitely both have had better results. The pit stops were perfect and the race strategy was spot on again. We want to be out in front again tomorrow – but with all three cars.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 1st, Race: 1st, Drivers’ standings: 3rd, 146 points):“That was another perfect Saturday for me. Pole, victory and maximum points – that is fantastic, and something of a rarity. Given the conditions, it was just a case of getting as much out of today as possible, as the track was both wet and dry in qualifying. It also started to drizzle shortly before the start of the race. However, we held our nerve and did the job correctly. We were able to open a lead, then maintain that lead and secure the win. I am overjoyed.” Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 14th, Race: 12th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 77 points):“We struggled with the balance of the car a little in qualifying today. That cost me a lot of time. I had a similar problem in the race. That is what prevented me from finishing higher. Congratulations to Marco Wittmann. We are now hoping for a better day tomorrow.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 9th, Race: 13th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 33 points):“What can I say? It is simply not meant to be. I actually had a good start, then I got shaken up from the left and right. My car was so badly damaged on the right side that there was nothing I could do from that point on. It is just frustrating at the moment that there is always something, and that it is just not coming together for us. We must hope again that we have a better day tomorrow.” Bart Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“Congratulations to Marco Wittmann. What a great result. We managed to get Philipp Eng into the top ten, which is not easy in the DTM. I’d like to thank the team for a good job and a strategy that paid dividends this time. Sheldon van der Linde had a good start position after qualifying, but the start was not so good. That resulted in us losing positions early on. However, that is part of the learning process. We must improve in this regard for tomorrow. It is obviously disappointing not to have been able to get Joel Eriksson on the grid. We have some work ahead of us. We must achieve better qualifying results with Philipp and do everything we can to ensure that Sheldon and Joel get back in the top ten, as that is where they belong.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 11th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 4th, 119 points):“We picked up some good points, but still lost ground in the Drivers’ Championship. I am very happy with the second half of the race, but not entirely happy with the first half. I didn’t really feel comfortable at first. Then I found a good rhythm. Our strategy was definitely the right one, and the second half of the race was superb. Congratulations to Marco Wittmann on the win. With pole position, that makes it maximum points for him today. I hope I can do the same thing tomorrow.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 15th, Race: DNS, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 43 points):“It is obviously a great shame that I couldn’t start the race, however these things happen in motor racing. It is now important to ensure the car is perfectly prepared for Sunday’s race; then we will go on the attack again.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 6th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 30 points):“It feels very good to be back in the points. Four points for eighth place is good. It has been a tough weekend so far, but qualifying went really well. I had never driven here before, and it is not an easy circuit. My start was not good, and I consequently dropped back to tenth place. However, I was able to fight my way back to eighth place. I am optimistic ahead of tomorrow, as the car is running well.”\n"}

{"prompt":"Internationally homogeneous appearance in TV and print marketing underscores the diversity in the range of Sports Activity Vehicles and Sports Activity Coupés – Electrically powered driving pleasure is the focus of emotive series of short films for use on social media.  ->","completion":" Munich. With two new communication campaigns, the premium automobile manufacturer BMW is directing attention to the growing diversity in its range of Sports Activity Vehicles and plug-in hybrid models. The TV commercials and online films produced under the motto “Choose your X” convey a sense of the different living environments in which one of the BMW X models – of which there are now seven in total – is the perfect choice. The short film series “Unplug & Play” shows how straightforward it is to enjoy electrically powered driving pleasure in a BMW plug-in hybrid model – literally simple enough for a child to understand.Both campaigns are designed for international use. The start of the “Choose your X” campaign coincides with the market launch of the new BMW X1 and the new BMW X6 and is set to dominate presentation of the BMW X models in TV, online and print communication over the course of the next three years. The short films under the title “Unplug & Play” will be shown on YouTube as well as being used for other social media activities.The letter X as a symbol of independence.The world of mobility is full of decisions to be made: left or right, laid back or sporty, on-road or off-road? The BMW X models provide the perfect answer to many of these questions: everything is possible. They offer driving pleasure without compromise, combining dynamic performance, comfort and agility with generous space and unbridled forward thrust with exemplary efficiency. As such, the letter X has come to symbolise freedom of choice and independence, which is why it is the focus of the new communication campaign “Choose your X”. Of course it’s up to viewers themselves to decide which of the BMW Sports Activity Vehicles and Sports Activity Coupés – of which there are now seven in total – best meets their needs.The internationally homogeneous communication instruments will be deployed across all automobile markets worldwide, focusing on the shared character elements of the BMW X models. Three TV commercials, two online launch films and eight additional films of varying lengths have been produced for this purpose. The campaign motifs derived from these also serve as a basis for the presentation of the BMW X models in the online and print areas.The modular structure of the campaign makes it possible to highlight individual models and the entire BMW X family. Striking emotional imagery and a powerful musical background express the core characteristics that enable the BMW X models to individually fulfil the desire for independence and freedom: a supreme appearance, versatile driving characteristics and progressive technology in the areas of operation and connectivity.The BMW X5 was the first model of its kind to combine the versatile qualities of an all-wheel drive vehicle with hallmark BMW sporty flair on the road: 20 years after its debut, the unmistakable characteristics of a BMW X model can now be experienced in a range of different of segments. In the premium compact segment, the BMW X1 Sports Activity Vehicle and the BMW X2 Sports Activity Coupé have become established as globally successful entry-level models. Meanwhile, the BMW X3 and BMW X4 in the mid-size segment and the BMW X5 and BMW X6 in the luxury performance segment also provide a diverse choice.Sustainable mobility – simpler than ever.In the short films in the series “Unplug & Play”, BMW entertainingly showcases the fascination of purely electrically powered and therefore locally emissions-free mobility. The main protagonist of the commercial is a little boy who is already very familiar with the straightforward procedure for using a BMW plug-in hybrid model – simply take out the plug and the fun begins. In a range of different situations, his pulling of a plug sets in motion an action-packed chain of events. At the end of the film, he pulls the charging plug of his mother’s BMW 330e Sedan out of the Wallbox, and the two of them set off to enjoy electrically powered driving pleasure in the plug-hybrid model together.This humorous film focuses on the ease and peace-of-mind that is offered by using electrical energy for sustainable driving pleasure. A 75-second version of the commercial can be seen on the international BMW YouTube channel. Shorter versions have also been produced for use on social media.In the area of plug-in hybrid models, BMW offers a level of diversity that is unique within the competitive environment. The spectrum ranges from the highly versatile BMW 225xe Active Tourer in the compact segment through to the plug-in hybrid sedans of the BMW 3 Series, BMW 5 Series and BMW 7 Series and the BMW X5 xDrive45e as well as the sports cars BMW i8 Coupé and BMW i8 Roadster . Production of the BMW X3 xDrive30e is due to begin before the end of this year. It will be followed next year by plug-in hybrid variants of the BMW X1 and the BMW 3 Series Touring. By 2023 the BMW Group’s range will comprise a total of 25 models with electric drive.In Germany, the BMW Group is the market leader in the segment of electrically powered automobiles with a share of nearly 20 per cent. In the first six months of 2019 the company was able to sell more than 10,000 vehicles in its home market which are either purely electrically powered or fitted with plug-in hybrid drive. This was an increase of some 60 per cent over the previous year. BMW is the market leader for plug-in hybrids in Germany as well as in Europe and worldwide. The reasons for this are the early market entry in 2014 and the broadest product range in the competitive environment.\n"}

As of the upcoming 2019\/20 season, which gets underway on 21st\/22nd September with the Bol d’Or in Le Castellet (FRA), the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team will contest the FIM EWC with the new RR. The commitment is in collaboration with the team MRP of Team Manager Werner Daemen (BEL). The riders will be announced at a later date. “The FIM Endurance World Championship is an attractive platform for us for many reasons,” said Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad. “Endurance races like the Bol d’Or or Le Mans are real tests of stamina for both man and machine during which we can showcase the performance of our BMW S 1000 RR on the international stage. The FIM EWC is becoming increasingly popular around the world and gives us the opportunity to be present also in the Asian markets. That’s why it is a logical step for us to expand our works commitment with the new RR, which is already making waves in the FIM Superbike World Championship this season. I’m looking forward to gripping endurance races with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team.” “As part of our customer racing programme, we have had a presence in the FIM EWC for several years and we are looking forward to taking the next step with the new BMW S 1000 RR and having a works involvement there now,” added BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “Werner Daemen’s MRP team is a competent partner with a wealth of racing experience, who is also already very familiar with the new RR. We’re also excited to have Dunlop on board and part of this project as tyre partner. Dunlop will also provide strong support with their expertise. The objective is clear: The first season in this top-level world championship will be a year of learning in which we want to become more and more competitive step by step. In the longer term our aim is to be up there among the leading pack and battling for the title.” “We’re really looking forward to this fantastic new project and being able to enter the Endurance World Championship with the support of BMW Motorrad Motorsport and a works team,” said Werner Daemen. “I believe that we have the necessary experience and we are eagerly awaiting the 2019\/20 season. I would like to thank BMW Motorrad Motorsport for their continuous confidence in our work. I was an active rider in the Endurance World Championship myself and recorded a few successes, for example, second place in the 24-hour race in Francorchamps in 2000. I hope to be celebrating similar successes with the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team sometime in the near future.” In preparation for the start of the season, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is currently developing an endurance version based on the RR Superbike used in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Among other things, the Superbikes in the endurance world championship have bigger tanks, a fast refuelling system and other modifications that target longevity and ergonomics. FIM Endurance World Championship 2019\/20*. 21st\/22nd September 2019: Bol d’Or * provisional calendar \n"}

With the recent success at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park (CAN), a similar high-speed, flowing, old school circuit, where the team qualified one-two and finished second and fourth the team is ready for a good weekend at Road America. Tom Blomqvist (GBR), competing in his first race at Road America, and Connor De Phillippi (USA) will drive the #25 BMW M8 GTE and John Edwards (USA) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) will pilot the #24 BMW M8 GTE. The green flag for the two-hour-and-forty-minute race falls at 1:35 p.m. local time on Sunday, August 4th. Quotes ahead of the race at Road America. Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “I think most folks know that Road America is my favourite circuit in North America. Over the years the track has been very good to us as it has seemingly been designed for a BMW with the track’s long straights and flowing corners - regardless if it is a BMW M3, BMW Z4, BMW M6 or BMW M8. We were very competitive at Canadian Motorsport Park so I believe we have to be optimistic about our chances at Road America.” Tom Blomqvist (#25 BMW M8 GTE): “I’ve been lucky enough to have tested already at Road America earlier in the year and I can tell you it’s one of my favourites. It’s an epic track and one that should suit our package. We’ve been making steady progress in the right direction and we will be aiming for nothing less than a top three finish.”Connor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M8 GTE): “Road America is one of the ultimate tracks in North America and it fits the strengths of our BMW M8 GTE perfectly. We came so close to pulling off the victory last year and this coming weekend we have the chance to redeem ourselves. The combination of high and low speed flow is second to none.”John Edwards (#24 BMW M8 GTE): “We had a good test at Road America and we had good pace there last year. The track at Road America should suit our BMW M8 GTE well and I think we have a good shot at winning. The atmosphere in Elkhart Lake is always awesome as it feels like the town is centred around racing. I’m looking forward to being back and hopefully standing on the podium again.”Jesse Krohn (#24 BMW M8 GTE): “Road America is my favourite track in the US. Fast, long, technical and flowing corners is everything that a driver wants from a race track. Road America also suits our BMW M8 GTE very well.” \n"}

By the end of a turbulent 24-hour race in Spa-Francorchamps (BEL), defending champions Walkenhorst Motorsport had put in an impressive chasing performance as the #34 BMW M6 GT3 – driven by Christian Krognes (NOR) and BMW works drivers Nick Catsburg (NED) and Mikkel Jensen (DEN) – claimed 11th place after starting from 35th on the grid. An accident that was not the fault of the drivers forced BMW Team Schnitzer’s #42 BMW M6 GT3, driven by Martin Tomczyk (GER), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and John Edwards (USA), to retire just before the halfway point after an equally strong performance had seen them move up to third place. The 71st running of the classic endurance race in the Ardennes was affected by extremely changeable weather conditions. Drivers battled through soaring temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius during qualifying, but fog and heavy rain then interrupted the race for six hours. After 363 laps, victory in the third race of the Intercontinental GT Challenge was claimed by the #20 Porsche. During the first 12 hours, the #42 BMW M6 GT3 of BMW Team Schnitzer and the #34 BMW M6 GT3 of Walkenhorst Motorsport had battled their way through the field thanks to some impressive overtaking manoeuvres. Both cars struggled with the heat during qualifying but after starting from 31st and 35th positions they had moved into the top ten by early on Sunday morning. Edwards was battling with poor visibility and heavy rain at the wheel of the #42 car at around 04:30am when he was involved in an accident through no fault of his own. Another car hit him from behind and sent him spinning. The damage to the car was so severe that Edwards, Farfus and Tomczyk had to retire from the race. Shortly after the accident, the worsening weather conditions saw the red flag come out and the race suspended. The #34 Walkenhorst Motorsport car saw out the night without incident, resuming the race after a near six-hour interruption in second place. Krognes took the lead after the restart, but the BMW M6 GT3 had to head for the pits after the obligatory technical stop that cost the team five minutes. The long interruption meant that there was not enough time left in the race to make up that time and catch the leaders. The winning car from last year crossed the finishing line in 11th place. Three BMW M6 GT3s were competing in the Am category. The Boutsen Ginion team’s #9 car completed a challenging race to secure eighth place in the Am class. The second BMW M6 GT3 of Walkenhorst Motorsport and the 3Y Technology team car both retired. Reactions to the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps: Henry Walkenhorst (Walkenhorst Motorsport Team Principal):“Of course, the fact that we won here last year means that we aren't really satisfied with 11th place. You could see that the cars with turbo engines were struggling in the heat throughout the week and could not reach the performance levels we had hoped for, especially in qualifying. Our race speed was then pretty good and we were able to move up through the field until the race was stopped. Unfortunately, the red flag phase really hurt us due to the technical pit stop that we still had to make. Some tyre problems and a collision during the final phase also cost us some time. We could have reached fifth or sixth despite the race interruption. Congratulations to our lads, who didn't make any mistakes.” Nick Catsburg (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, 11th place):“After the five-minute technical pit stop in the race, we just didn't have any more time to make any progress. But I am still very proud of the performance from the entire team. We didn't make any mistakes and the car was very fast. Ultimately, luck was just not on our side. You win some, you lose some.” Mikkel Jensen (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, 11th place):“To start with, I am happy to have completed a 24-hour race for the first time in my career. The race went really well during the night. My lap times were some of the fastest out there. Unfortunately, I couldn't get to that speed at the end and the closing phase was very difficult for me. But it was primarily the fact that we had to make our five-minute stop under the green flag, and not during the yellow flag phase like many other teams, that cost us a top finish.” Christian Krognes (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, 11th place):“Although we didn't make any mistakes and made good progress, we didn't get the result we had hoped for. We came here to fight for a podium finish and, for a while, it looked like it would be possible. I think that the red flag benefited our competitors more than it did us, as we still had to make the technical pit stop. It would have been good to have a few more hours on the track to make up that time. It was a shame that the race finished like that, but we will be back to try again next year.” Herbert Schnitzer jr. (BMW Team Schnitzer Team Manager): “Of course, that is a really bitter pill to swallow for the whole team. We were doing really well and had a realistic chance of a podium finish. But the accident that led to our retirement was not our fault, just like at the Nürburgring. The drivers and the whole team really deserved to be rewarded for their great work.” John Edwards(#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer, DNF):“The conditions were very dangerous for racing. In fact, the fog was more dangerous than the rain. On every lap I used the radio to say that a ‘full course yellow’ or a red flag would have been appropriate, as the conditions were very dangerous. Unfortunately, what happened to me was the best example for that. That is very disappointing. We were in third place at the time and I think that we could have recorded a good result.” Augusto Farfus (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer, DNF):“It is difficult to put this into words. The race was going very promisingly. The track temperature was in our favour and we worked really well together as a team. I think we had a good pace and we did mount a superb chasing performance. The conditions at the end were extremely difficult and it was a very unlucky situation for John. But that's motorsport.” Martin Tomczyk (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer, DNF):“That result is hard to take. The weather conditions were pretty tough. John was hit by a car that was struggling with aquaplaning. It is a huge shame that we had to retire, as we were doing well at that point. But those are the pitfalls of a 24-hour race. Unfortunately, that's not the first time I've experienced it this year.”\n"}

The interdisciplinary programme for the event gave 35 up-and-coming scientists from 15 countries the chance to present their visions of AI-enhanced mobility – and to discuss the challenges that lie in wait with renowned experts from science and industry.  ->","completion":" Munich. As an initiative from the BMW Group Research division, the BMW Summer School provides junior scientists from all over the world with a regular opportunity to discuss their research with top-class experts from both theoretical and practical backgrounds. This year’s get-together took place in Lenggries-Fall, Bavaria on 15 – 20 July 2019 under the auspices of the French consul general, and was staged in collaboration with EURECOM, the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and BayFrance with the support of the Franco-German University, the Digitalist Group and the German-French Academy for the Industry of the Future. The platform the BMW Summer School provides for dialogue with established professionals from academia and industry combines with the participants’ multidisciplinary backgrounds to give the event its distinct identity. This year, young researchers from the fields of computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, psychology, law and industrial design got together. “We see the BMW Summer School as a benchmark for cooperation between industry and universities“, said Hannemor Keidel, TUM representative for scientific relations with France. Artificial intelligence is transforming mobility and urban living.“Advances in the field of artificial intelligence have a major role to play in shaping the future of mobility,” commented Michael Würtenberger, Head of the Excellence Cluster for AI at the BMW Group. “The BMW Group identified AI as a vital research area at an early stage and set up the requisite development expertise.” The influence of AI extends far beyond mobility into day-to-day life, future production methods and business processes; AI therefore affects society as a whole. The interdisciplinary nature of the BMW Summer School 2019 made it the ideal forum for highlighting to participants the social relevance of their research topics. BMW Summer School: the sharing of scientific knowledge between the worlds of theory and practice across three main areas.To facilitate an intense exchange between the junior researchers and the experts from science and industry, the programme for the BMW Summer School 2019 was organised into three main areas.Highlights from the keynote track, for example, included a talk by Carlo Ratti, who heads the Senseable City Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Ratti: “Large cities worldwide are facing enormous challenges. Big Data and AI can give us better knowledge of the urban environment, and thus their potential beneficial applications are countless. This requires a new generation of researchers to think and collaborate across disciplines and it is great to see this kind of thinking fostered by the BMW Summer School”. There were also breakout sessions that gave the participants the chance to discuss specialised topics in small groups with academics and industry representatives. The issues up for debate included the use of AI for mobility services, design thinking methodology, quantum computer technology and ethical considerations relating to the interaction between human and artificial intelligence. “The successful development of smart cities relies on the harmonization between people, mobility solutions and infrastructure and their mutual cooperation. We are expecting artificial intelligence and 5G to be catalysts for smart cities”, said Weiyun Jiao from the Chinese National Center for Intelligent Transport Systems in one of the sessions.The poster track centred on the fields of research pursued by the up-and-coming scientists. The participants presented the ideas behind their current research and its objective to the multidisciplinary audience in a competition format. This year’s awards for the best research posters and most engaging presentations went to Matthias Zöhrer (Graz University of Technology), Dantong Ge (Beijing Institute of Technology) and Felix Batsch (Coventry University).The third key element was the lean startup machine. The participants were split into mixed groups, asked to develop innovative product and service ideas based on their research topics under the guidance of agile design coaches and eventually present them to the audience in a short pitch. This competition gave the young researchers a realistic impression of what putting technological innovations into practice entails, be it in the form of a business idea or company startup. This year’s winning team of the startup pitch award created the concept for „APPetite“ – an AI empowered meal planner that helps its users to reduce the ecological impact of food waste.In addition to the three main elements of the BMW Summer School 2019 programme, the PhD students also seized the opportunity to share ideas informally among themselves and with the assembled science and business experts. This allowed them to gain some inspirational insights into the research work carried out in various disciplines and its practical application in the industrial sector. A pair of evening events involving Prof. Jörg Ott and Prof. Constantinos Antoniou from TUM and Dr. Markus Grüneisl, Head of Production Systems, Digitalisation and Operative Excellence at the BMW Group, helped maximise this exchange of knowledge. Experts at the BMW Summer School 2019.Industry and business:Pang Heng Soon, SGInnovate, SingaporeMarkus Grueneisl, BMW GroupToni Cheng, AlibabaUlrich Fastenrath, BMW GroupJane Vita, Digitalist GroupOliver Oberst, IBMJakub Marecek, IBMTom Hubregtsen, BMW GroupIrina Benkert, BMW GroupKyle Hounslow, Digitalist GroupResearch:Prof. Carlo Ratti, MITWeiyun Jiao, ITSC, Ministry of Transport, People’s Republic of ChinaProf. Arnaud de la Fortelle, Mine ParisTechProf. Jean-François Bruneau, IVADOProf. Jörg Ott, TUM Prof. Constantinos Antoniou, TUMSusanne Müller, Munich School of Philosophy Research committee at the BMW Summer School 2019.Committee chairpersons:Prof. Ulrich Finger, Director of EURECOMProf. Andreas Herkersdorf, Head of the Chair for Integrated Systems, TUMMichael Würtenberger, Head of Research E\/E Architecture and Technologies, BMW Group\n"}

This weekend features another highlight of the endurance season – the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). For BMW Team Schnitzer and Walkenhorst Motorsport, this also forms the third race of the season in the International GT Challenge. Walkenhorst Motorsport travels to the Ardennes as defending champion following last year’s victory in Belgium. BMW teams claimed a stunning one-two at the 70th edition of the 24-hour race last year, with Walkenhorst Motorsport taking victory ahead of the ROWE Racing BMW M6 GT3. This year, the team from Melle (GER) is back again to do battle at the head of the field. At the wheel of the #34 BMW M6 GT3 will be last year’s winner Christian Krognes (NOR), Mikkel Jensen (DEN) and Nick Catsburg (NED), who triumphed at Spa in 2015. The trio is contesting the full season for Walkenhorst Motorsport in the Intercontinental GT Challenge, which includes the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps. BMW Team Schnitzer also returns to Spa-Francorchamps in 2019 as a competitor in the Intercontinental GT Challenge. After two fifth-places in the races so far at Bathurst (AUS) and Laguna Seca (USA), the two regular drivers, Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Martin Tomczyk (GER) are currently third in the Drivers’ Championship. They will be ably assisted in Belgium by John Edwards (USA), who has driven the BMW M6 GT3 in the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER). As well as the two BMW M6 GT3s in the Pro category, a further three cars will also race in the Am Cup. Walkenhorst Motorsport fields a second BMW M6 GT3 in this class, while Boutsen Ginion and 3Y Technology will each run a car. Quotes ahead of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“This weekend we return to the scene of many BMW victories in recent years and decades. The one-two for the BMW M6 GT3 and the first major endurance success for Walkenhorst Motorsport last year were fantastic achievements. In total, BMW cars have now won 24 times in the Ardennes, including three victories in the last four years. That is an outstanding record. This year, we once again line up with two teams that are capable of winning, in the form of BMW Team Schnitzer and Walkenhorst Motorsport, who will also be doing their best to pick up as many points as possible in the third race of this season’s Intercontinental GT Challenge. I am delighted that we will also be represented in the Am Cup with three BMW M6 GT3s run by BMW customer racing teams. My fingers are crossed for all the teams and drivers.” Augusto Farfus (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer):“The 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps is the biggest GT3 race in the world and also forms the highlight of the season in the Intercontinental GT Challenge. The points on offer here are crucial to our chances in the title races. As such, our goal is to challenge for the win and to continue the magnificent history that BMW has at this race. The test a few weeks ago went well. I am optimistic about the race.” Nick Catsburg (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport):“Since winning here for BMW in 2015, I always travel to the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps – one of my favourite races – with very fond memories. The results in recent years have shown that BMW cars are always quick on this circuit. Furthermore, this year I am racing for last year’s winners, Walkenhorst Motorsport. We have a very strong line-up. I don’t see anything to suggest that we cannot challenge at the front again.”\n"}

The BMW Group is paving the way for introduction of dual vocational training at its new plant under construction in Debrecen, Hungary from September 2021. A cooperation agreement to this effect was signed with the Debrecen Vocational Training Centre (DSZC) on 18 July. The BMW Group will work with these partners to implement the German dual vocational training concept in Hungary. This will ensure that apprentices are optimally prepared for future occupations in innovative learning environments, with high quality standards and flexible structures. In autumn 2019, the first intake will embark on five years of vocational training: two at school and three in the dual system, with learning in the classroom and on the job at the BMW Group. “We believe that combining theory and practice is vital in employee training. I’m especially pleased we will be able to offer young people at our new location in Hungary dual vocational training and help them make the ideal start to their career,” underlined Michele Melchiorre, the designated head of the Debrecen plant. The BMW Group will offer four attractive apprenticeships at the new location: electrical and automation engineering, mechatronics, automotive mechatronics (systems and high-voltage technology) and information technology for systems integration. Sabine Wilhelm, head of Professional and Vocational Training and Transformation Management at the BMW Group, emphasised the benefits of the concept: “We have introduced dual vocational training based on the German model at five production locations worldwide since 2012, always taking local factors into account. In cooperation with the Debrecen Vocational Training Centre (DSZC), we will now also be able to implement it in Hungary. We are very happy to be able to provide our future apprentices with the ideal preparation they need for their future occupations, in innovative learning environments with high quality standards and flexible structures.” The partner schools have already been chosen: In the DSZC Brassai Sámuel Műszaki Szakgimnáziuma and the DSZC Mechwart András Gépipari és Informatikai Szakgimnáziuma, the BMW Group has found two highly qualified local partners based in Debrecen to cover the theoretical side of training. Together with these two schools, the BMW Group will now develop a detailed concept for implementation of the dual vocational training programme. Participating apprentices will spend the first two years of the five-year programme at one of the two schools, where they will learn the basic practical skills and theory needed for their chosen occupation. From the third year on, attention will increasingly turn to practical application of this knowledge. Apprentices in the programme will gain on-the-job experience at the BMW Group in Debrecen. In addition to professional qualifications, the BMW Group will also focus on apprentices’ personal development throughout the training. The first intake of apprentices will embark on their training at the partner schools in the autumn of 2019. Pupils will be able to apply for an apprenticeship in spring 2021 and begin their dual vocational training at the BMW Group in September 2021.\n"}

The tenth DTM race of the year saw an impressive recovery performance at Assen (NED) from Marco Wittmann (GER) in the Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, as he moved up from 18th on the grid to finish second. After his win in the wet on Saturday, the BMW Team RMG driver also proved to be the best-placed BMW driver in dry conditions on Sunday. Victory went to Audi driver Mike Rockenfeller (GER). Wittmann’s fellow BMW drivers did not manage to score any points on the TT Circuit. Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM), Timo Glock (GER, JiVS BMW M4 DTM) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) had to settle for 13th, 14th and 15th positions. Joel Eriksson (SWE, CATL BMW M4 DTM) and Bruno Spengler (CAN, BMW Bank M4 DTM) both were forced to retire. Tyre management was a crucial factor for all drivers. Wittmann only needed to make one stop during his sensational recovery performance as he raced from the back of the grid to the podium. He is now in third place in the drivers’ standings with 118 points, and is 40 points behind leader René Rast (GER, Audi). In the manufacturers’ standings, BMW now has 406 points. Reactions to the tenth DTM race of the 2019 season at Assen. Rudolf Dittrich (General Manager BMW Motorsport Vehicle Development): “Sunday's race at Assen followed a totally different script to the events in the wet on Saturday. Tyre management was the decisive factor. Towards the end, virtually all drivers were struggling and some had to make a second pit stop. Without a doubt, Marco Wittmann was the man of the race. He finished second after starting from 18th on the grid. In the closing stages, he was just concentrating on getting the car home and defending his position on his well-worn tyres. He managed to do that, showing once again how well he can manage tyres over the distance. He scored some important points. However, the race took a disappointing course for our other drivers. We will take a close look at the reasons for our problems to deliver consistently strong pace. Assen has proved to be a great addition to the DTM calendar and provided spectacular motorsport in wet and dry conditions. Both races were real DTM highlights for the spectators. Congratulations to Mike Rockenfeller on his win today.” Bart Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“Firstly, congratulations are in order for Marco Wittmann on his performance. Moving up from 18th place to finish second is excellent. The race did not go well for us as the pace was simply not there. Joel Eriksson had to retire, and we chose a different strategy for the other cars with a second pit stop, but that didn't help us much.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 8th, Race: 13th, Drivers’ standings: 4th, 111 points):“I am extremely disappointed after this race, and I cannot explain why we were not competitive. The tyres were done for after just a few laps and I could not attack. All we can do is write this race off.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 11th, Race: 16th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 43 points):“We already had a few problems in qualifying, although the pace was actually good. The set-up was great. In the race, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time a few times and then I had to retire. It was just not my weekend.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 6th, Race: 15th, Drivers’ standings: 13th, 26 points):“To be honest, I don't know what the reason for that was today. I started well and made quick progress. But then I had contact – and after that, the car stopped working like it should. It wasn’t like in qualifying, we were right off the pace. We will have to take a close look at that now.” Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“What a race. It was clear to see that it is always worth continuing the fight. The guys did a great job on the race strategy – and Marco Wittmann delivered yet another masterful race. If you really exert yourself, something good will come of it. And that is how we will continue to work.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 18th, Race: 2nd, Drivers’ standings: 3rd, 118 points):“Second place is just mad! After qualifying, I started the race in a bit of a rage. The first lap was great and my pace quickly moved me up into the top ten. Then we decided to make an early pit stop but I never expected to make it to the end on those tyres. It really worked out, though. Once again, this weekend showed that you can never give up in the DTM and that anything is possible.” Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 12th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 77 points):“My steering was slightly damaged during qualifying in the morning, however, we couldn’t do anything about it due to the Parc Fermé and we decided to give it a go in the race. Unfortunately, the problem got worse and my front left tyre was showing some severe wear. We had no choice but to head for the pits.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 9th, Race: 14th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 33 points):“I made a bad start and nearly stalled the car. Then I got stuck in traffic, which led to greater tyre wear. The front left tyre suffered particularly badly. All we could hope for was a safety car that never came.” \n"}

This means the Frankfurt-born Croat is responsible for design at the BMW core brand. Over the last nine years, he has worked as chief designer for various wings of the BMW Group – most recently BMW i and BMW M, which remain under his leadership umbrella within BMW Group Design.“My job is to orchestrate these three areas of the company so they link together to create a strong image,” says Dukec, who has amassed many years of expertise at international design studios. In his role at BMW he leads a team of over 100 designers working to enhance and redevelop the design language of current and future BMW brand models. As an experienced automotive designer, he can call on a highly refined repertoire of approaches. He views the design process as a management task and team endeavour in equal measure. “I work with flat hierarchies, giving a lot of responsibility to each designer within the team,” emphasises Dukec, who put down his design roots in the automotive industry at an early stage. “They should all see themselves as a key elements in the solution.” His focus: design as an engine. Aged just 13, Domagoj Dukec was clear in is mind that his future lay in automotive design. As a schoolboy, he was regularly driven by his father to Pforzheim, where he presented sketches to the university’s School of Design. His dedication left an enduring impression, and as a young guest student he gained the initial insights he later built upon in full-time studies there. During this period, he spent all his vacation time on internships with various car manufacturers. This taught him how as a designer you are responsible not just for the aesthetic and functional execution of a product, but for its commercial success as well. After spells at renowned studios in Barcelona, São Paolo and Paris and 13 years in automotive design at brands including VW and Citroën, Dukec finally answered BMW’s call to Munich in 2010. In 2013 he took over as Head of the Exterior Design team. He describes BMW as the pinnacle of his profession, the place he has always wanted to be. His mindset: unlock creative power.“Automotive design is a special challenge, because you’re bound to the industry, have very clear requirements and need to think into the future.” As chief designer at BMW, Domagoj Dukec heads a team of designers, modellers and other specialists charged with setting up design frameworks and initiating change. “I like solving puzzles,” he says about his work, which he goes about in a deliberately entrepreneurial way. He emphasises how, for him, creativity above all means putting the right conditions in place: “I like to do the best I can for a product, with a positive mentality in the team and the optimum process behind the scenes.” Dukec’s design teams develop model ranges for BMW, BMW i and BMW M. This pooling of responsibility helps to focus the design of the brands squarely on modern products with strong characters. Perpetual motion: embarking on a new chapter in automotive design.“BMW as a company is most keenly defined by the three brands BMW, BMW i and BMW M. The models we’re now developing are even more clearly differentiated, which will continue to strengthen the unmistakable character of BMW through design,” reiterates Dukec. “After all, design is successful when it has its own identity.” He is firmly convinced that future-focused vehicle design should not only provoke aesthetically, but also demand cultural reappraisal. “So as a designer, you need to be prepared to take a risk,” says the 44-year-old. “Customers should be able to sense this energy in the product.” Background: The inspiration that drives him. Domagoj Dukec describes himself as an “emotional rationalist”, pointing to inspiration from the art world – figures such as Michelangelo and Karl Lagerfeld. The extreme, daring facets to these two creative geniuses fascinate him as much as the authenticity and the clarity of thought and deed in their work.

The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has recorded another podium finish with the BMW S 1000 RR in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Tom Sykes (GBR) secured third place in the Superpole race at Laguna Seca. This was the third podium for the new RR in its WorldSBK debut season. Sykes crossed the line fifth in the afternoon’s second race. Team-mate Markus Reiterberger (GER) finished the two races on Sunday in twelfth and 13th positions. The Superpole sprint race in the morning was interrupted due to an accident shortly after the start, before restarting with a reduced, eight-lap format. Sykes secured fourth place on the grid, but Alvaro Bautista (ESP \/ Ducati) was missing from the front row. Sykes immediately moved into third place and crossed the line without ever being in danger of losing that position. Reiterberger started the sprint race from eleventh position, finishing in twelfth place. In the afternoon, Sykes started race two from third place, while Reiterberger began in twelfth. Sykes lost one place in the first turn and remained fourth until lap 13, when Alex Lowes (GBR \/ Yamaha) passed him. He closed up on Lowes again, crossing the line just half a second behind him in fifth place. Reiterberger moved up to eleventh for a while after overtaking Sandro Cortese (GER \/ Yamaha). He maintained this position until the 14th lap, before falling back a little and finishing the race in 13th place. The WorldSBK is now heading for a summer break. The tenth event of the season will take place from 6th to 8th September at Portimão (POR). Quotes after race two at Laguna Seca. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “That was a good day to round off a great weekend – a podium in the Superpole race and then another solid performance and fifth place for Tom in the second race. Markus was able to improve throughout the day and close the gap to the riders in front. We have some homework to do and we won’t see our competitors again before the tests at Portimão at the end of August. A large part of the team is now heading for some well-deserved vacation time. We can be very pleased with the season so far as we have clearly exceeded our expectations.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Tom claimed a great result in today’s sprint race. He rode really well; to take the third position and a front row start for race two was a solid performance all around. In the race, as we hoped, he had a pretty good start, only Toprak got in front of him, he slotted in and was in a solid fourth position. He rode a good race. Alex Lowes got by him after he made a mistake and then he recovered well. He dropped two seconds and pulled that right back. If there had been another lap he probably would have got fourth back. So it was great progress by Tom and they can go into the summer break happy. Markus had a reasonably good day. The sprint race showed more progression but I was even more happy in the second race. He rode some pretty good lap times and overall it was a big improvement on his race one result. So overall we can be pleased going back home and we can make a plan exactly what we need to focus on in the next phase of the development of the bike.” Tom Sykes: “We’ve come away again with a bag full of top-5 finishes, including a podium in the sprint race. Overall it was a very productive weekend for the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. The bike seems to be not getting the best from the tyres at the moment but we got a lot of information this weekend and having said that it was a complete different story at the end of that race two. We had a lot of pace and I closed the gap to Alex Lowes so that’s certainly positive to take with us. We now have the summer break coming up so it’s just cool that at the right time we got a lot of information at the weekend and hopefully now the guys in the team can put this to good use. There are still areas to work on but overall the whole package is quite promising and having three podiums at the last three rounds is not too bad against these experienced manufacturers. I’m enjoying riding, have a great relationship with the team and BMW and it’s needless to say that we are heading in the right direction. I think everybody has seen that the progress we’ve made from the opening round until now has been quite impressive.” Markus Reiterberger: “The restart in the Superpole race was great. I made up a few places and crossed the line in a decent twelfth position. For the second race, we chose different tyres to yesterday. They were reliable for the first 15 laps but then there was a big drop with lots of movement and then it was just about getting to the finish. Unfortunately, that meant I lost two places. I did have my eye on the top ten but I missed out on that, however, we did score a few points. I had hoped for more from the weekend as I know that I can do much better. That’s why I’m hoping we can find a way for me to attack properly with the bike and go really fast. We have to continue working on it and then the breakthrough will come. I would like to thank the team as they gave it everything again this weekend.“ \n"}

BMW i Andretti Motorsport has finished the ABB FIA Formula E Championship 2018\/19 with another podium success. At the wheel of the #27 BMW iFE.18, Alexander Sims (GBR) secured second place in the New York City E-Prix after starting the race from pole position. After the 13th and final race of the season, Sims stood on the podium for the first time in his Formula E career. He was able to defend first place until the 18th lap, before conceding the lead to eventual winner Robin Frijns (NED, Virgin). António Félix da Costa (POR) reached ninth place in the second BMW iFE.18. Together with fourth place on Saturday, this result allowed Sims to take another leap forward in the drivers’ standings and he finished the season with 57 points, in 13th place. Félix da Costa reached sixth place in the overall standings with 99 points. The title went to Techeetah driver Jean-Éric Vergne (FRA). BMW i Andretti Motorsport secured fifth place in the team championship, with 156 points. The team can look back on a successful debut season in Formula E after recording one win, two pole positions and a total of five podium finishes. Félix da Costa began with victory at the season-opener in Ad Diriyah (KSA). The Portuguese driver followed that with podiums in Mexico City (MEX), Sanya (CHN) and then on Saturday in New York (USA). Having already claimed two fourth-place finishes, Sims’ pole position and second place made the finale on Sunday his most successful Formula E race day. Reactions to the New York City E-Prix: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“I am very proud that we have been able to celebrate another superb result to finish our first Formula E season with BMW i Andretti Motorsport. Congratulations to Alexander Sims on his first pole position and his first podium finish in this series. Alex gave a strong performance and deserved this success. Closing his rookie season with a podium is excellent. António Félix da Costa was also able to score some points in ninth place. We have rounded off the season in a positive way. We gained a lot of valuable experience as a team over the course of the 13 races. In Ad Diriyah we kicked off the season in style – claiming victory with the BMW iFE.18 in its very first race. At the first attempt, we were able to fully exploit the huge potential and the high efficiency of our Racing eDrive01 drivetrain. The same went for the subsequent Marrakesh E-Prix, where we had the great chance to score our maiden one-two. We all remember what happened there. In some of the following races we weren’t able to make the most of our potential for various reasons. On the one hand we made mistakes, on the other hand plenty of red-flagged races meant we couldn’t translate the fantastic efficiency of our drivetrain into top results. Considering the experience gained this season, I am confident we will be able to raise our game in this respect for Season 6 – despite the growing level of competition in this series. The successful weekend in New York simply motivates the team even more as they prepare for the new season. We know we have a great drivetrain and the right team to succeed in Formula E. Congratulations to DS Techeetah and Jean-Éric Vergne on winning the title. He is a fully deserved champion.” Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal):“We started the season strongly - and we ended it strongly too. Pole position and finishing second for his first podium were a great result for Alexander. He has been working towards that all year. Starting from 14th place made it difficult for António but he drove a clever race and was able to benefit from incidents ahead of him at the end. In particular, the consistency of our performances this weekend gives us reasons to be optimistic. Season 6 starts for us on Monday.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 1st place, race result: 2nd place, FANBOOST voting: 13th place, points: 57):“It feels fantastic to be on the podium as I had just missed out a few times in the past. Of course, I would have liked to have won from pole position. Nonetheless, I am very pleased with the overall result. Finishing fourth and second at the finale is a great effort. I have learned so much this season and there were plenty of ups and downs. Bearing that in mind, I am very happy that we are heading for the summer break after a race like this.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 14th place, race result: 9th place, FANBOOST voting: 5th place, points: 99):“It really wasn't easy today to make up ground from the middle of the pack. We managed to reach ninth place though. Just like yesterday, both drivers scored some points for the team. It's a shame that we don’t have a third race as we did very well here in New York. I have finished the season in sixth place in the drivers’ standings. We were in the leading group for the whole season and winning the first race remains the highlight of course. I think we have had a good season overall.” The BMW i Support Vehicle Fleet.BMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 5.

Markus Reiterberger (GER) qualified eleventh in Superpole and came home 15th in the race. Laguna Seca hosts round nine of the 2019 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). In the closing minutes of Superpole, Sykes was able to take advantage of the faster qualifying tyres to secure fourth place and a spot on the second row of the grid. Shortly after the start of the race, the Brit briefly sprinted into second place on his RR, however then dropped back to fifth in the turmoil of the first few corners. When Alvaro Bautista (ESP \/ Ducati) crashed in front of him, Sykes moved back into fourth place and never looked back. Reiterberger, back in the team after a severe viral infection and making his first appearance at Laguna Seca, improved consistently. He ended Superpole in eleventh place, before picking up one point for 15th place in the race. Quotes after race one at Laguna Seca. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We are pleased with the solid fourth place. Finding the right set-up for the bike was far more difficult here than at recent events. However, the result is once again very satisfying. Markus improved consistently as he learned more about this complex circuit throughout the sessions leading up to qualifying. In the race, however, he had difficulties. We must now analyse how we can help him in tomorrow’s race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We went into Superpole with some unknowns what the best setting would be. Anyway, Tom did a great job. He put the qualifying tyre in and managed to secure P4 on the grid which was fantastic. It was on his second lap which is quite unusual; we did not expect to get two laps out of the tyre. On Markus’s side we made some over night changes. He made a big progress and a good job in the Superpole. In the race, Tom got a great start, he could have cut across the two Ducatis into turn two but it could have been a bit of a risky move. Anyway he played it safe which was wise. He consolidated the race after Alvaro went out and got a good fourth position. I think it just epitomises the kind of approach from Tom. We’re making progress; we don’t want to put it in the gravel trap but be able to gather valuable data. Markus’s race was very difficult. He struggled, he ran off the track. We have to work hard to find a good setting for him to go into Superpole race tomorrow and we see where we go from there.” Tom Sykes: “We gambled for today’s race one by going with the ‘X’ tyre and you could say it paid off considering we got a fourth place. On the other side of that the tyre did drop off pretty early which meant we had to manage the tyre from midway through the race so you could argue that with a harder tyre we perhaps could have gone faster. However, with that being said a P4 on paper is not bad at all considering how early we are into this project. I was trying my best to close the gap to Toprak and at one stage I was doing that but I was just riding on the limit especially with the front tyre. But like I said I am happy with fourth place, the team did a great job in getting the electronics and traction control right today so let’s see if we can build on this heading into tomorrow’s two races.” Markus Reiterberger: “We improved a lot today compared to yesterday. Yesterday was all about getting to know the circuit and finding the set-up for the bike. Today, I was far quicker in the third practice session and Superpole. We improved consistently and I was able to secure a place on the fourth row of the grid which was not too bad. Unfortunately, we possibly opted for the wrong tyre in the race and changed the settings a little, which did not have the desired effect. I had more issues again and also had a little run-off after a front-wheel slide. That is why I only finished 15th. I am still struggling to ride tight lines and we will do our best to find a solution here. I’d like to thank the team for all their hard work.” \n"}

The final race of the Formula E season will take place on Sunday. Reactions to the New York City E-Prix: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“Congratulations to the whole team on this strong result here at our American home round in New York. We are in really good form again here at the end of the season. Both António Félix da Costa and Alexander Sims kept calm and remained fully focussed on their race, despite the heat and the many incidents. Third and fourth place is yet more proof that the BMW iFE.18 is one of the strongest cars in the field and is good for top results. We want to demonstrate that again on Sunday – and to end Season 5 with another highlight.” Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal):“We have a good day behind us. We were competitive with both cars right from the first practice session. We could have finished even higher in qualifying, but the result we had meant we were able to attack in the race. Both António and Alexander had good, clean starts. They pulled off some nice overtaking manoeuvres and drove intelligently. The safety car period did not necessarily play into our hands, but that is motor racing. Despite that, both drivers had what it takes to finish on the podium today. Furthermore, that was – except for Ad Diriyah – our best race of the year in terms of the total points haul. We want to back that up tomorrow.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 8th place, race result: 3rd place, FANBOOST voting: 5th place, points: 97):“Although my car was damaged at the start, following a few contacts, we had very good pace. We drove a clever race. I was able to save energy in a few phases, in order to use it later in the race. That allowed me to gradually work my way through the field. Alexander helped me a little on my way to the podium. He also deserved a podium finish. We both scored valuable points for the team. I am particularly pleased to have claimed a podium for BMW i Andretti Motorsport here in New York. That is great for the whole team.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 5th place, race result: 4th place, FANBOOST voting: 14th place, points: 36):“That was a really exciting race – very hot and very demanding.

Anyway, P2 is still a very good result.” Tom Blomqvist (#25 BMW M8 GTE 4th place): “I am disappointed with myself for losing three positions at the start. Ultimately, we had to make some strategy changes to try to make it up, but unfortunately the podium was just out of reach.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M8 GTE, 4th place): “We expected more from ourselves today than fourth, but we lost some performance compared with yesterday. It’s great that the team is back on the podium. Hopefully, that will give us some momentum heading to the next rounds of the championship.”\n"}

After pole position and a podium finish on Saturday, Sunday’s action in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Donington Park (GBR) did not go according to plan for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. In the Superpole race, unfortunate circumstances saw BMW S 1000 RR rider Tom Sykes (GBR) end up with a DNF instead of finishing in second on the podium. In the main race of the afternoon, a catch-up race saw him finish in seventh place. Peter Hickman (GBR) retired in the morning due to a technical defect, he finished eleventh in the afternoon. Sykes started the morning’s Superpole sprint race from pole position. He was embroiled in a close duel for the lead with Jonathan Rea (GBR \/ Kawasaki) and was at the front of the field for four laps. Rea overtook him, but Sykes was hot on the heels of his rival in second place. With three laps to go, a technical defect meant Hickman lost oil, several riders fell as a result, and the race was aborted. After the race was red flagged and the field headed back to the pits, the oil slick also sent Sykes skidding into the gravel. Second place was taken away from him and he was classified as not having finished the race. This meant Sykes had to start the second main race of the afternoon from tenth on the grid. With a plucky catch-up race, he moved up into seventh. Hickman started from eleventh on the grid and briefly dropped down one place, but was back in eleventh after the second lap, where he remained until the end of the race. Hickman stepped in for Markus Reiterberger (GER) at Donington Park, who was unable to compete after contracting a severe viral infection. Reiterberger will return to action in the next round this coming weekend at Laguna Seca (USA). Quotes after race two at Donington Park. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Unfortunately, today didn’t go according to plan. Firstly, we are very sorry that the technical issue with Peter’s motorcycle in the Superpole race affected other riders, who ended up falling. Unfortunately, Tom’s second place was revoked after he fell on the cool down lap and was unable to make it back to the pits with his bike within the requisite time. In the main race he delivered another outstanding performance and got a lot out of the race with seventh place. We need to file today under learning year and move forward. We saw that the pace of the BMW S 1000 RR is definitely there, and we hope we can convert this into the corresponding results in the Superpole and all three races at Laguna Seca. Kudos to Peter, who jumped in at short notice and delivered a really strong performance.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The rule book went against us in the Superpole Race. Tom did everything right. He had a good, strong pace. It was only between him and Jonathan to battle for the win in the sprint race. To be penalised with the five-minute return-pit-lane rule we felt was extremely harsh considering all the circumstances. However, there is nothing in the rule book that would have allowed any different outcome to that. Tom could not get the bike back to the paddock – it could not be moved – within the five-minute period stipulated in the rule book. So, we must accept the outcome as harsh as it is. Tom’s main race was obviously affected by starting from tenth. He rode a strong race and even though he struggled with grip he was within a second of fourth position and not too far away from the podium. We have to take strength from this weekend; I’m pleased with the guys, I’m proud of everyone’s effort, and proud of how everyone bounced back from such a big knockback in the sprint race to come back fighting in the main race. We will take this away with us, it will hopefully make us stronger and we will learn from it. Peter had a bit of a lonely main race. If he had got away a little bit sharper at the start, he could maybe have stayed with the guys in front of him. But we are happy with P11. He did not put a foot wrong all weekend, coming in at the last minute and he has certainly done himself and the team proud.” Tom Sykes: “It certainly was an unlucky day. When we came over the hilltop into Melbourne Loop after the red flag, there was a parked car right at the edge of the tarmac, and riders, bikes and marshals, so I looked up just to try and understand if someone was coming on track. Then I hit the oil, Jonathan nearly crashed and I unfortunately did. What happened completely changed the dynamic of the day and of the long race. Starting from tenth, I struggled as I would have needed some clear air. The performance was certainly compromised in today’s race. It’s a shame because we definitely had the pace for the podium. Yes, I’m disappointed but with the form we have shown this weekend, we still have a lot of positives to take away.” Peter Hickman: “I’m a bit disappointed to be outside the top ten, to be honest. I felt I had some pace to be in the top ten. But I did not quite have the grip in the final race compared to what we had earlier in the day and yesterday. Maybe the track temperature went up a bit but because of what had happened in the Superpole Race, we did not the have time to make changes to the bike based on what we had learned in the first race for the second. But that’s the way it goes. I’ve had a good weekend, I’ve enjoyed myself and learned something. The team has been fantastic, thanks to Smiths Racing BMW for allowing me to compete here, and to Dunlop UK for allowing me to drop their weekend to come here. I hope to get an opportunity like this again sometime in the future.” \n"}

A total of three BMW drivers finished in the points in the eighth race of the year. Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM) of BMW Team RBM saw the chequered flag in fifth place. Timo Glock (GER, JiVS BMW M4 DTM), who started the race from 17th on the grid after suffering a technical problem in qualifying, showed real fighting spirit and worked his way up into ninth place during the course of the race. Joel Eriksson (SWE) had to make do with 13th place in the CATL BMW M4 DTM. Local hero Marco Wittmann (GER, Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) both retired due to technical problems. Both of them were also on track to finish in the points for much of the race. It was Spengler‘s 16th DTM victory – and his fifth win at the Norisring. This makes him the sole DTM record winner at this track. He celebrated his 50th podium. BMW have now racked up a total of 85 DTM wins. A BMW driver has stood on top of the podium four times in 2019, and therefore in half of the races to date. The best-placed BMW driver in the overall standings is still Eng with 101 points in third place. Behind him are Spengler :“After the technical defect in qualifying I had to start from the back of the grid. Then we tried to make the best of it – which we did well. So, we were able to pick up some points. After another car bashed into my car a tyre was damaged and we had to pit earlier than planned. But you can’t do anything about that. The speed was okay. Congratulations to Bruno, he deserved the win after having had so much bad luck with the safety car in previous races this year. I’m pleased for him, the team and BMW.”\n"}

He then finished runner-up in the afternoon’s opening race, claiming the second WorldSBK podium for the new RR. Peter Hickman (GBR), who is standing in for Markus Reiterberger (GER) at Donington Park, finished fourth in Superpole qualifying and seventh in the race. Reiterberger was forced to pull out of this weekend’s event with a severe viral infection. Donington Park is the venue for round eight of this season’s WorldSBK. Sykes already showed on Friday that he feels comfortable on the RR at his home circuit in Great Britain, setting the fastest time of the free practice sessions. Conditions were initially damp for Saturday’s Superpole, before the track started to dry out. Sykes secured pole position with an advantage of almost a second over Jonathan Rea (GBR \/ Kawasaki). This was the 49th pole position for Sykes, who holds the record for the most poles in WorldSBK. Hickman, who is familiar with the BMW S 1000 RR from the British Superbike Championship (BSB) and road racing, and knows the Donington Park circuit well, qualified fourth to secure a good starting position for race one. The Saturday race then took place in wet conditions. Sykes was passed by Rea at the start, but his second place never looked under threat throughout the entire 23-lap race. He also set the fastest lap of the race en route to the podium. Hickman lost several positions at the start, but then found a good rhythm and rode a flawless race to cross the finish line in seventh place. Quotes after race one at Donington Park. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It was a super Saturday at Donington Park. As early as Friday, there were signs that Tom would have a say in the battle at the front of the field. In Superpole, he gave an awesome display and the team chose a very good strategy to secure the first pole position for our new BMW S 1000 RR – and to improve his own record. In the race, he was equally impressive in taking second place. Congratulations to him on that performance. Peter also had a good Saturday. He jumped in at short notice and, even if you know the bike and the circuit, you have to earn fourth place on the grid in such a strong field. He showed his experience in the race and finished a good seventh. We have confirmed that we are moving in the right direction with our fledgling project. We are now really looking forward to tomorrow.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The entire team can be proud today. With Tom, we continued the good work from Misano and it was great to get the maiden pole position for the new RR. We then really would have wished to have a dry race because we felt we had the pace strong enough to be on the podium if not to win in dry conditions. We’ll see what tomorrow will bring. Tom’s confidence is getting stronger and stronger every race event we go out. So we can only expect good things to come tomorrow. Peter has never raced in these conditions with this bike so to get on and do what he did was fantastic. He uses his head very sensibly there. He took a brave decision in qualifying to go out on slicks at the very end with not many doing that and to secure fourth on the grid was fantastic. Also with P7 in the race, Peter has had a great day.” Tom Sykes: “I am really happy. The speed has been there all weekend, certainly in dry conditions. It was just fantastic to claim pole position this morning. In the race in wet conditions, we had some limitations but it’s great to bring it home in second position. It’s still really quite incredible where we are as it is so early in the programme. Credit to the entire BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. What they are doing is outstanding. I’m really happy to now have two podiums on two consecutive weekends. It would be nice for all guys in the garage if we could keep this momentum. As I said, we had some limitations today in the wet and we will try to improve that. In dry conditions, I feel ready to race anyway, so I am really quite relaxed at the moment and enjoy my racing.” Peter Hickman: “I’m happy enough. The race was the first time actually for me to ride the bike in fully wet conditions so it has been a little bit of an unknown for me. It was also different for me to get used to the electronics again. I’m happy that I came away with a good and solid top ten result. The start wasn’t the best; we had a little problem at the start which put us back. If we could have gone way with the front group I maybe could have gone with them a little bit. But we’ve made some improvements, we’ve got some good data and if it rains tomorrow I’m sure we can have a good race again. I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s sprint race, I normally don’t do sprint races so it’s something new for me again. Obviously we will start from fourth again after today’s Superpole, which is really strong. If we get a good start and get away in that front pack, fingers crossed, we can get a strong result.” \n"}

He trails championship leader Rast by 27 points. BMW lies second with 301 points in the Manufacturers Championship. Reactions to the seventh DTM race of the 2019 season at the Norisring. Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director): “That was another of those races which only the Norisring can produce. We once again had exciting scenes in the very first corner – and the safety car again turned everything on its head. René was last, then out came the safety car and suddenly he was leading. Despite that, congratulations to René Rast on his win. Our guys tried really hard to make the most of the situation. Bruno and Philipp had the pace to match the front-runners. The extent to which Marco’s tyres were wearing made it very difficult to finish the race. There was not much left of his tyres. Joel had had a good race until he lost second place in the final corner. Maybe he could have made himself a bit wider there. His podium is a positive but, on the whole, we did not score enough points. We must try to show the pace that Bruno and Philipp had from the start tomorrow, and to qualify at the front, in order to score maximum points.” Bart Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“It was another special race here in Nuremberg; nother safety car and a scenario that leaves you with mixed feelings. In my opinion, Philipp Eng’s penalty after a great qualifying was not justified. However, we still went into the race full of motivation and wanted to make the best of the situation. In the end, we finished on the podium with Joel and were seventh with Philipp, which is a good result on the whole. However, we had the potential for it to be even better.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 2nd, Race: 7th, Drivers’ standings: 3rd, 91 points):“It was a bit of a tough day for me. I had a super qualifying, with P2, before I was given a penalty that I cannot really understand. Despite this, I had a good start and was able to climb into third place. Unfortunately, the safety car period turned the race on its head. Hopefully we will have a little more luck tomorrow.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 6th, Race: 3rd, Drivers’ standings: 9th, 43 points):“We had a good strategy and showed good pace throughout the whole race. I had a few great battles with Nico Müller. It was fair racing and great fun. I did not expect him to stick it up the inside in the final corner. However, I think he would have passed me in the last corner anyway, even if I had closed the door on him completely, as he still had DRS available. His tyres were also in better condition than mine at the end of the race. That is a shame, but we will continue to push. We scored some important points today.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 12th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 25 points):“I found myself sixth after a good start. Then came the safety car period. After the re-start, it all got a bit too tight for me in turn four. I made light contact with Timo. That was my fault. I am very sorry. And I would obviously like to apologise to Timo.” Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“Another race decided by a safety car period. There was more in it for us today. We must now ensure that we have even better pace for tomorrow, and that we can make the most of it. I’d like to thank the team, who once again gave it everything.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 7th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 4th, 72 points):“That was obviously a disappointing race. We took a big risk and stopped on lap two. The safety car did come, but unfortunately we did not have the same pace as Audi. In the end, the tyres were completely on their knees and I dropped back to eighth place. In the end, that is not the result I had hoped for in my home race. However, we have a second day tomorrow.” Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 4th, Race: 5th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 51 points):“I have once again lost points as a result of bad luck with the safety car. That obviously hurts. Despite that, I was again able to make up a lot of ground today, as my car was consistently quick. The team did a great job, both in preparing the car and during the pit stop. I am now just hoping that I might perhaps have a bit of luck with the safety car.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 14th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 21 points):“It is just not meant to be at the moment. Qualifying was tough enough. Although we only made a slight change, the car was completely different to drive compared to yesterday. Then we had a good first lap, but no luck with the safety car, which it seems will decide the championship this year. In the end, it is obviously not nice to be hit by your own team-mate. However, I don’t blame Sheldon. That kind of thing can happen.”\n"}

However, unlike a classical fixie bike, the BMW model cuts no corners in terms of comfort. Its Shimano Nexus seven-speed hub gear ensures dynamic acceleration and no maintenance issues. The BMW M Bike is an even sportier creation, inspired by BMW M cars and decked out in matt black paintwork and stripes in the M Motorsport colour scheme. The Shimano SLX\/XT groupset has eleven gears, while the fork, spacers and seat posts are made from carbon fibre – efficient lightweight design, motor sport-style. The BMW hybrid e-bikes, meanwhile, have their collective finger on the pulse. For example, the BMW Active Hybrid E-Bike can rack up big mileages on a single charge, thanks to its Brose Drive S Alu motor and 600 Wh lithium-ion battery. And the BMW Urban Active Bike is perfect for the daily ride to work with its slender frame design and barely visible battery.

The attending physicians have banned him from flying and working. In Hickman, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has found a replacement from the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family who is very familiar with the new BMW S 1000 RR. The 32-year-old represents Smiths Racing BMW in the British Superbike Championship as well as in international road racing. This year he has brought home wins with the new RR at the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy and the North West 200. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We were very sorry to hear that Markus is suffering from a viral infection and is unable to compete at Donington. With Peter Hickman we were able to find a worthy replacement from the BMW family at very short notice. Peter rides a package very similar to WorldSBK in the British Superbike Championship so it shouldn’t take him long to find his feet.

I thank him for letting us know as soon as possible to give us time to find a replacement. Obviously it was very important to us to have an existing BMW rider as a replacement rider and Peter Hickman is an ideal choice for us. He is already riding the current bike and he agreed to join us very quickly so we are very hopeful that he can do a good job for us at Donington Park and assist us with the development of the BMW S 1000 RR. At the same time, I want to thank his team, Smiths Racing BMW, for releasing him for this event and hopefully we can have a good, positive race this weekend before we go to Laguna Seca.” Peter Hickman: “First of all, I’m sorry for Markus that he is unable to race at the weekend and I wish him a speedy recovery.

When we travelled to Australia with the brand-new BMW S 1000 RR for the season opener in February, we knew that we would have major challenges in store. And we have mastered them well. For us, 2019 is a year of development, and so far we have achieved what we set out to do: continuously improve the racing version of the RR and gradually close in on the top. Tom’s podium at Misano was fantastic affirmation of the hard work put in by everyone involved. Now we want to build on this and continue on the current path in the direction of the top spots.

We come with a lot of hope and expectations after a very positive Misano weekend for Tom and also Markus. On Markus’ side, we ended up in a very good position after the final race and we hope we can carry this confidence into Donington which I think will suit his riding style so we expect to be able to maintain progress with Markus with a good feeling with the bike. On Tom’s side, we have a rider in Tom that’s very high in confidence and looking forward for the first time in a long time to be racing at his home event. We know that he is extremely fast at Donington in Superpole and I think that we have shown that the BMW S 1000 RR has now become a very good package in race conditions. I also think that the track temperatures at Donington should suit the RR and I hope that both Tom and Markus can progress and we can push in the top six – and maybe the outside chance of a podium again is what Tom will be aiming for. With Markus we hope to make further progress and get into the top ten.” Tom Sykes: “I’m very much looking forward to my home round at Donington Park. Certainly coming off the back of some form at Misano, a strong performance and collecting the second place on the podium I feel that the development of the BMW S 1000 RR is in a good direction. The whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is doing some great work and we are all making progress. With that in mind and our recent form I’m really looking forward to Donington and hope that we can keep that level of performance – or maybe even squeeze a little bit more out. We’ll start to work for that on Friday morning!” Markus Reiterberger: “I have very good memories of Donington. I won there last year with a very good race. Overall the track is very demanding, and it reminds me a little bit of Schleiz. I really like it there. I hope that we continue to make good progress, and that we will have a good feeling as we head to Laguna Seca the following week, which is a new track for me. The weather in England is always a little unpredictable, but we have to try to prepare the bike well for all conditions. I am really looking forward to the weekend and hope that there will be further progress.” \n"}

On the Nuremberg street circuit, 14 of the 470 hp mid-engine sports cars built according to Group 4 regulations will revive the passion of the Procar series founded specifically for the racetrack debut of the BMW M1. “I’m really looking forward to the revival of the BMW M1 Procar series,” said Stuck. “The combination of the six fastest Formula 1 drivers and cool privateers hasn’t been seen since. Then there is the unique sound of the BMW M1. That is unique to this day. I just want to enjoy the ride. It really doesn’t matter to me whether I finish second, third or fourth. I want to drive the car, hear it and experience it. I’ve won enough races in my life.” To mark the occasion of the Procar Revival, BMW Group Classic has lined up numerous acclaimed drivers to return to the BMW M1 cockpit. In the 1980 Procar race at the Norisring Hans-Joachim Stuck won ahead of Jan Lammers and Marc Surer – all three legends will be reunited in Nuremberg this weekend. Also lining up will be Harald Grohs, who won the first ever race in the DTM 35 years ago at Zolder in Belgium, with a BMW 635 CSi. The crowd can look forward to a total of four appearances by the Procar races on all three event days, including right before each of the two DTM races.\n"}

We unfortunately had an incident with the #25 car with a fire in the pits, so we need to understand what happened there. Ultimately, that stopped that car short of the end of the race. The #24 car struggled a little bit with fuel economy but not pace so we just need to figure that out before next weekend’s race in Canada. CTMP should be a good track for us and for our cars I think. Watkins Glen International was as well but the race was just a little tough for us today. We have high expectations for the 2 hour 40 minute race at CTMP.” John Edwards (#24 BMW M8 GTE, 5thplace):“We ran at the front in the beginning of the race. It was promising with how close everyone’s pace was but we just lost some time at some points throughout the race. At a track like Watkins Glen, where everyone is very fast, it can be hard to gain that time back. So looking at the pace of the car we are definitely disappointed to finish 5th. Things are close here and CTMP is a similar track so we expect to be close there as well. Everyone seems to be on pace so we just need to minimise mistakes there.” Jesse Krohn (#24 BMW M8 GTE, 5thplace):“For the amount of hard work we put in this weekend the result does not really correlate. The car felt good, everyone was so close and the pace of the race was very fast, with no room for mistakes. We didn’t have the cleanest race so we ended up in P5. Last year was my first year at CTMP. I really like the flow and the track, so I am looking forward to it. I am glad we do not have to wait more than a week to go out there and try and redeem today's result because we definitely could have been in a better position today if things worked out just a little bit differently.” Tom Blomqvist (#25 BMW M8 GTE, 7thplace):“We got ourselves into a good position early on but it was a little bit of a strange race and everyone had to manage a lot with the fuel and with the yellows at the beginning. We were running our strategy and it looked like we were on for a good result but unfortunately an incident caused some damage to the front. The car was still okay but things started to go wrong a few laps later and it definitely did not get better with the fire. The track for next weekend’s race looks cool and really fun. I am really looking forward to racing at CTMP. We have made a lot of progress this week with the car and we're hungry for some good results now. We just need to run a smart race and see what that brings. I am looking forward to it!” Connor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M8 GTE, 7thplace):“I think from the beginning it was pretty clear we were going to be in the mix; the car was really, really good. I felt like the M8 GTE was very well balanced, so I was very optimistic about results. During a few points in the race we made some decisions to do other strategies and those did not fully work out. Our pace was still good and even after the contact Tom had, the car felt very good. We had to retire the car but to think of the positives this is the best balanced M8 I have had and we can take that with some smiles. For me, CTMP is one of my favourites on the calendar. It really suits our car and is similar to both Watkins Glen and Road America. Higher tyre degradation can be an issue there and some rain can also play in our favour. Anything is possible in Canada, so if we have a cleaner race, I believe that we can finish in a good position.”\n"}

Here, its president Holger Hampf reflects on the studio’s ongoing influence – as well as its role in the future of the ever-changing industry of transportation and mobility. ->","completion":" Munich. With its roots in the industrial design world, Designworks has over the course of more than forty years established itself as a world-class independent design consultancy that drives innovation. It is owned by BMW Group and is part of the company’s toolbox: an inspiring, thought-provoking studio that splits its workload between BMW Group and external clients. Here, its president Holger Hampf reflects on the studio’s ongoing influence – as well as its role in the future of the ever-changing industry of transportation and mobility. 1. What would you say are the key values of Designworks today, forty years after the studio launched?Holger Hampf: The most important thing is that we stayed committed to the original plan of Designworks operating as a profit centre with a split business model to the BMW Group. Working with external clients brings outside knowledge to the group, opens our horizon and means we do not only orientate towards automotive design. I think it is more important than ever to understand global trends and global changes at a greater scale while also being very familiar with the transformations happening in the automotive industry. That is something our external clients and partners value as well. 2. How important is this cross-section of different industries you work with?Holger Hampf: It’s very important. We are seeing people leading an increasingly digital life, and connectivity is key. What matters to people is having a seamless experience between their professional and their personal life. The automotive industry is still very relevant but it is becoming more of a mobility provider. In order to do so, we have to understand the spaces and places outside of the car too.Designworks has delivered some very successful work to many different industries in the past – healthcare, sports and consumer electronics – but we are currently in the process of focusing more on mobility-relevant topics. This is really a sweet spot of Designworks and being part of BMW Group is greatly validating our work and point of view. In the future we will be doing a lot more in this area. 3. So what are the next trends? What is the future of mobility and what is Designworks’ role in it?Holger Hampf: The world is moving from an object-centric view to a user-centric view. In the future, the car will connect with a much larger ecosystem of mobility and transportation and still plays a central role in it. But this ecosystem is growing and becoming more complex all the time: People expect to seamlessly use the car to get from a suburban area to the city and then take a train or a bike for the last mile. We want to help make these connections. 4. Designworks has studios in California, Munich and Shanghai. How important is this world-view?Holger Hampf: Very. We opened our Los Angeles studio in 1972, our Munich office in 2000 and set up our third space in Shanghai in 2006. These three locations of Designworks are all strategic picks.California has such a strong car and innovation culture. It has always been a very important place to gain insights on customer desires and needs. China is becoming a very strong market for BMW, one which is essential to understand from the inside as well.The headquarters in Los Angeles and our studio in Shanghai both play a vital role informing the BMW Group about trends in these markets. The Munich studio at the same time is tapping into European design culture and serves as a strategic bridge to BMW in our global network. All three studios together give us a very broad perspective. 5. What is your mission as president of Designworks?Holger Hampf: Quite simply, to be provocative in a positive way. My goal at Designworks is to address the effects of climate change, a growing population and urban density, and to offer a positive outlook and new solutions.Design is a forward-thinking and visionary discipline. At Designworks, we have to react to some of the challenges out there and face them with positive energy. We are operating with a solution-oriented attitude.\n"}

The BMW Group trial vehicle “Power BEV” presented during #NEXTGen explores what is technically possible. The vehicle is fitted with three fifth-generation electric drive units and has a maximum system output in excess of 530 kW\/720 hp. This enables it to accelerate from 0 to 100 km\/h at the rear axle. Another notable aspect of this generation alongside its eye-catching power is that it is entirely free of rare earths. An electric motor of this type will make its series production debut in the BMW iX3. The iX3 will only have one motor, though, rather than three.A current BMW 5 Series production model serves as the donor car for the Power BEV. Integrating a drive system of this type into a production car represents a serious technical undertaking, but it has been achieved here with absolutely no restriction in passenger compartment space. This makes it far easier to assess this drive concept alongside alternatives.It has also allowed the engineers to look even more effectively into the possibilities opened up by two separately controllable electric motors at the rear axle with e-torque vectoring.And that means, in future series-production vehicle projects, the right technology can be selected for the model at hand. Customers will therefore be provided with the most appropriate technology for their choice of vehicle concept.\n"}

The BMW Group makes all this possible – and is providing a glimpse of autonomous driving at #NEXTGen.    ->","completion":" Technologies for an on-demand mobility scenario.How about taking the BMW 7 Series out for a spin – and watching a film or even closing your eyes for a while? The BMW Group makes all this possible – and is providing a glimpse of autonomous driving at #NEXTGen.In an urban on-demand mobility scenario, a BMW 7 Series impressively demonstrates how high automation (Level 4) can transform the individual mobility of the future. An empty car, summoned by a smartphone app, drives up to collect its owner. The vehicle can be directed to any preferred pick-up point, with access authentication via smartphone upon arrival.In Level 4, since occupants no longer have to be directly involved in the driving process, the drive is initiated via an ODM tablet. The destination address is transmitted to the vehicle via the smartphone app in advance and the driving seat remains unoccupied.Due to safety mechanisms implemented in the vehicle, the drive can only begin once all occupants have fastened their seatbelts. Passengers can spend their time in the car however they wish. One option is simply to enjoy the entertainment system. Vehicle functions can also be controlled this way: Horn, headlight flasher and locking and unlocking doors are typical functions that have been implemented for demonstration purposes. Once the vehicle reaches its destination, the passenger gets out and lets the car park itself.To ensure safe driving in urban settings, the BMW Group is investing heavily in development of environment recognition technology with machine learning capabilities. Both high-performance sensor technologies such as computer vision and innovative sensor fusion methods are used. These technologies maximize the benefits of driver assistance systems for our customers. Next-level driver assistance: a glimpse of Level 2 functions.In addition to self-driving technology, the BMW Group also offers the latest generation of Level 2 driver assistance systems. Today's driver assistance functions use powerful radar sensors to safely and conveniently control the distance to the vehicle ahead. GPS sensors and map data are used to proactively adjust the speed for cornering and driving through built-up areas.The next level of driver assistance is on show at #NEXTGen: Camera sensors, machine learning and a powerful backend are used not only to detect speed limit signs, but also to interpret traffic lights, allowing speed to be regulated even more proactively and conveniently. History and milestones: automated driving since 2006. In recent years, the BMW Group has repeatedly demonstrated its mastery of key requirements for partially to fully-automated driving, all the way to autonomous driving. Back in 2006, a BMW 3 Series drove the ideal racing line around the Hockenheim Ring all by itself. Test vehicles with Level 3 have been driving on the A9 Autobahn in Germany since mid-2011.In 2014, an automated BMW prototype drifted down the Las Vegas Speedway for the first time – demonstrating how highly-automated driving can be pushed to the limits.At the CES show in Las Vegas in 2017, the BMW Group presented conditionally-automated, connected and personalised Level 3 driving on a demo drive in a BMW 5 Series Sedan. In the same year, a conditionally and highly-automated test fleet of 40 BMW 7 Series test vehicles was also launched in Germany, the US and Israel.In 2018, the BMW Group opened its Autonomous Driving Campus in Unterschleissheim outside of Munich and, in March of this year, the BMW Group D3 high-performance platform went on-stream. This Centre for Data-Driven Development combines a storage capacity of 230 petabytes with the computing power of more than 100,000 cores and 200 GPUs.By acquiring a stake in HERE in 2014 and through collaborations with Intel, Mobileye (since 2016) and other partners, the BMW Group fired the starting signal for series development of the BMW iNEXT.In 2021, the BMW iNEXT will feature the BMW Group’s first secure Level 3 function for motorways. The BMW Group and its partners, now mostly working at the new BMW Group Autonomous Driving Campus, are joining forces to create a scalable technology platform for realisation of safe and stable highly and fully-automated driving. \n"}

Racing eDrive01 – that’s the official title of the highly-efficient power unit at the heart of the success enjoyed by BMW i Andretti Motorsport in the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. It propels the BMW iFE.18 race cars, with drivers António Félix da Costa (POR) and Alexander Sims (GBR), to top performances – and top results – in the official BMW works team’s first season in the series for fully-electric formula cars. Félix da Costa won on the team’s debut in Ad Diriyah (KSA) in December 2018. That win allowed the same BMW i engineers that are otherwise responsible for the drivetrain in production models, like the BMW i3, to feel like true winners. Their experience of electrification proved to be crucial at the racetrack. BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt said: “At the start of the development process for the E drive in Formula E we were faced with the question: Do we build up our own expertise at BMW Motorsport, or do we use the extensive BMW i experience in this area? We soon arrived at an answer. Naturally, it made sense to make use of the wealth of experience of our colleagues in production.” What followed is a prime example of the interplay between production and motorsport development. Under the umbrella of BMW i Motorsport, a completely new development cycle was established. The goal was always to make the most efficient use of capacities and to create as many synergies as possible. Responsibilities were clearly allocated. The production specialists looked after the electric motor hardware and the inverter, meaning the entire high-voltage area. This included the software that the inverter uses to control the E motor, as well as the materials used, such as for the rotor and stator. Meanwhile, the BMW Motorsport engineers primarily handled matters such as the low-voltage control area. They devised recuperation strategies, undertook the design and implementation of the entire rear axle structure and developed the cooling concept. “Everything that each area can do best was intertwined with full transparency. The technology transfer between our BMW Motorsport engineers and BMW i colleagues works really well,“ said Marquardt. The result is a cycle of know-how and experience, which can only benefit both sides in the future field of electrification. BMW i Motorsport gains experience under extreme conditions at Formula E racetracks – and in direct competition with many other automobile manufacturers. This experience and any findings are then incorporated in development. “This means that every BMW i customer benefits from our joint progress in racing,” said Marquardt. For example, the control software for the high-voltage area, which controls the E motor via the inverter, is used in both the BMW iFE.18 and the BMW i3. From a sporting perspective, this unique combination has proved to be competitive from race one in Formula E. Away from the track too, the BMW Group is using this ever-expanding racing series to demonstrate its innovative expertise in key future issues within the automotive industry. Electrification forms the basis of this, but other focus subjects, such as autonomous driving, connectivity and services – in combination with pioneering design, such as can be found with the BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car – are in the spotlight at every race. As such, Formula E is becoming a symbol for the consistent future orientation of BMW i, BMW Motorsport and the BMW Group as a whole. The BMW i Support Vehicle Fleet.BMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 5. Spearheading the fleet are two Safety Cars: The BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car , which has been specially modified for use at the racetrack, and the BMW i8 Coupe Safety Car . The BMW i fleet also includes the BMW i3s as “Race Director Car” and the BMW 530e in its role as “Medical Car”.\n"}

Fully charged as it accelerates along its Future Highway 2025, the BMW Group is adjusting frequency to up the tempo of its electromobility expansion programme. The company will now achieve the total of 25 electrified models previously announced for 2025 two years earlier, in 2023. Thanks to flexible vehicle architectures for fully-electric, plug-in hybrid and combustion engine drive trains, the company is able to respond quickly to changing conditions. More than half of the 25 models will be fully electric. “We are moving up a gear in the transformation towards sustainable mobility, thereby making our company fit for the future: Over the past two years, we have consistently taken numerous decisions that we are now bringing to the roads. By 2021, we will have doubled our sales of electrified vehicles compared with 2019,” said Harald Krüger, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, in Munich on Tuesday. “We will offer 25 electrified vehicles already in 2023 – two years earlier than originally planned. We expect to see a steep growth curve towards 2025: Sales of our electrified vehicles should increase by an average of 30 percent every year.” As part of the new #NEXTGen communications format, the BMW Group is showcasing the next generation of mobility and next steps it’s taking in that direction. The BMW Vision M NEXT provides a glimpse of the dynamic future of the BMW brand in the form of a striking electrified sportscar. The BMW Vision M NEXT is clearly focused on the person driving the vehicle, with intelligent technology to transform them into the ultimate driver. The BMW Motorrad Vision DC Roadster previews the future of BMW Motorrad with alternative drive forms. This highly emotional motorcycle preserves the identity and iconic BMW Motorrad appearance, but also offers a new form of driving fun. “Our vision is clear: sustainable mobility, produced in a sustainable manner. We have set ourselves the goal of only buying electricity from renewable energy sources for all our locations worldwide from 2020,” said Krüger. “We fulfil our social responsibility – in all its different facets. We are firmly committed to emission-free driving. At the same time, we stand by our corporate responsibility towards our employees, shareholders and investors.” The BMW Group: a pioneer in electromobility As an e-mobility pioneer, the BMW Group is already a leading supplier of electrified vehicles. By the end of 2019, the company aims to have more than half a million vehicles with fully-electric or plug-in hybrid drive trains on the roads. Within two years, the company will offer five fully-electric series-production vehicles: Alongside the BMW i3, with more than 150,000 units built to date, this year will see the start of production of the fully-electric MINI at Plant Oxford (UK). This will be followed in 2020 by the fully-electric BMW iX3 from Shenyang (China) and, in 2021, by the BMW iNEXT, which will be produced in Dingolfing (Germany), and the BMW i4 from Plant Munich (Germany). Including its extensive fleet of plug-in hybrids, the BMW Group has the widest range of electrified vehicles on the market. Updated, extended electric-range plug-in-hybrid versions of the BMW 3 Series, BMW 7 Series and BMW X5 were presented alongside the new BMW X3 plug-in hybrid at this year’s Geneva Motor Show. A few weeks later, the updated plug-in hybrid variant of the BMW X1 Long Wheelbase Version, which is produced locally for the Chinese market, was shown at the Shanghai Auto Show. Later this summer, plug-in hybrid versions of the BMW 5 Series and BMW 2 Series Active Tourer with next-generation technology and longer electric range will also be released. These will be followed next year by the BMW X1 and the BMW 3 Series Touring as plug-in hybrid models. This diversity of electrified drive concepts underlines the importance of technology openness on the road to sustainable mobility. The BMW Group has always promoted emission-free mobility and advocated for its effective support. However, the demands of future mobility will be multifaceted. There will not be just one single solution that meets the mobility needs of all customers around the world. People living in rural areas, for instance, need different technological solutions for mobility than those in cities. BMW eDrive Zones standard in plug-in hybrids from 2020 The effective role plug-in hybrids can play in achieving emission-free mobility in cities is demonstrated by the BMW eDrive Zones function, which will be standard in BMW plug-in hybrids from 2020: In cities that establish “green zones” solely for emission-free driving, geofencing technology will be able to recognise these automatically. When the vehicle enters one of these zones, it will automatically switch to pure electric driving mode. In this way, BMW is paving the way for plug-in hybrids to receive the same access rights to green zones as fully-electric vehicles, since they behave the same in these areas. This new type of operating strategy significantly boosts the potential of plug-in hybrid vehicles to reduce emissions. Increasing the use of electric driving not only optimises efficiency, but also helps reduce operating costs for customers – especially in city traffic. After the idea was born, the first real-life test for the BMW eDrive Zones function is the BMW Group’s “Electric City Drive” pilot project, in conjunction with the City of Rotterdam and the local Erasmus University. New #NEXTGen communications format With the “BMW Group #NEXTGen” format, the company is taking a new approach to presenting its future technologies, services and products. The BMW Group invited international journalists, analysts and other stakeholders to the BMW Welt in Munich to experience six world premieres and two highly emotional vision vehicles. The programme will be rounded off with a Global Influencer Day on 26 June. In this way, the company is building on its existing global commitment to international auto shows and tech and future fairs with a regular independent format for individual mobility “made by the BMW Group”. In addition to world premieres of new models, a particular focus will be on experiencing the latest technological developments from all D+ACES areas of the company: Design, Autonomous Driving, Connectivity, Electrification, Services. \n"}

Next year is set to be a good year for private BMW drivers and teams who battle for race wins and titles around the world. BMW is offering customers with a passion for grassroots motorsport and club racing a global service and technical support. Furthermore, the model range is being successively renewed. Leading the way in 2020 is a new entry-level race car, based on the BMW M2 Competition , which isequally suited to racing at club and professional levels. The successor to the BMW M240i Racing, is currently being developed and tested. The focus is on easy handling – with the highest technical quality and maximum safety. The first cars are to be delivered at the start of the second quarter of 2020. A maiden test under race conditions is planned for round five of the VLN Endurance Championship at the Nürburgring (GER) on 3rd August 2019. The BMW M2 Competition is setting fresh benchmarks in the compact high-performance sports car segment. It’s powered by a six-cylinder in-line engine with M TwinPower Turbo Technology, based on the power unit from the BMW M3\/M4, with three-litre cubic capacity, delivering 410 bhp with a peak torque of 550 Nm. Creating a race version of this model was a logical step. Furthermore, the Customer Racing service concept is to be expanded by building and developing competence centres in the USA and Asia. To achieve this, experienced partners will be commissioned to support teams at a local level with a high degree of motorsport expertise. On the distribution and service side, dealers with a focus on motorsport will be established around the world. They will offer optimal customer care, in line with BMW’s high standards, thanks to special training. This new area offers the ideal entry opportunity for BMW drivers who have, for example, fallen in love with motor racing whilst on BMW Driving Experience training courses. “Our new offering will allow us to bring motorsport even closer to our customers in the future,” said Markus Flasch, President of BMW M GmbH. “With the new entry-level model, based on our BMW M2 Competition, we are showing a strong commitment to Customer Racing in general. At the same time, we are also starting to establish the BMW M club racing sector. Future BMW M special editions will be particularly relevant in this regard. The presence on the club racing scene sees us close the gap between our motorsport training courses within the BMW Driving Experience and grassroots racing series. With our dealers focussing on motorsport, which we plan to establish around the world, and the additional competence centres, we want to offer the best possible service and a professional supply of spare parts outside of Europe, as well as efficient customer care on a local level – regardless of whether the customer in question is an entry-level driver or a professional.” BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt added: “It is fantastic to be able to take BMW’s Customer Racing programme to the next level with the new club racing sector, as well as the associated setting up of global service and distribution structures. Customer racing at BMW has arguably never been as diverse as it will be from next season. With the new entry-level model – the successor to the BMW M240i Racing – we are, on the one hand, offering our grass-roots customers continuity. On the other hand, we are also addressing a new target group with the club level variant.”\n"}

He birdied the second play-off hole to defeat England’s Matthew Fitzpatrick, who had to settle for second place. Martin Kaymer, who led at the halfway point of the tournament, finished tied in 16th place and missed out on his second victory at the BMW International Open, having previously won his home event in 2008.This was only Pavan’s second victory on the European Tour, and he was rewarded for his effort with a cheque for 333,330 Euro. The number 133 in the world had previously triumphed at the Czech Masters in 2018. The 30-year-old is the first Italian winner of the BMW International Open. His final round of six under par on Sunday was the second best of the day, with only Thorbjørn Olesen (DEN) and Bernd Wiesberger (AUT, both -7) carding better. After he and Fitzpatrick shared the first play-off hole with pars, Pavan made the breakthrough at the second attempt, courtesy of an outstanding approach shot and a regulation putt for birdie.“It is unbelievable. This win feels a bit surreal,” said a beaming Pavan. “I played together with Filippo Bergamaschi today – a friend from Italy. That definitely helped. It is so tough to win a tournament. I feel blessed to be stood here with the trophy. My caddy, Cristian Alejandro Molina, is a great guy. This victory belongs to him at least as much as it does to me.”The BMW International Open was still wide open until well into the final round. A glance at the leaderboard shows just how hard-fought the Sunday was: No fewer than seven players – defending champion Matt Wallace (ENG), Rafa Cabrera Bello (ESP), Edoardo Molinari (ITA), Jordan Smith (ENG), Matthias Schwab (AUT), Alvaro Quiros (ESP) and Christiaan Bezuidenhout (RSA) – finished tied for third place on 13 under par.Kaymer, the first and still the only German to win the BMW International Open, had been sitting pretty at the top of the leaderboard on Friday, following rounds of 67 and 66. However, his putter went cold at the weekend, and the two-time major winner could do no better than one over par on the final two days. Despite this, the 34-year-old was still in a positive frame of mind: “The killer for me this weekend were holes six and eleven. I was four over par for those two holes. Given the drives I hit, I could easily have been four under par – and have won the tournament. However, I will focus on the positives: I had a really superb week in many regards, and played 68 holes very well.”As well as Kaymer, Germans Max Kieffer (-5, T37), Dominic Foos, Max Schmitt (both -1, T53) and Marcel Schneider (even par, T60) also made the cut.In the second round, India’s Gaganjeet Bhullar hit a hole-in-one on the 17th (par 3, 179 metres) to win a BMW M8 Competition Coupé worth 193,880 Eur\n"}

Having achieved the first podium finish for the new BMW S 1000 RR in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) on Saturday at Misano (ITA), the next podium was within reach for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team on Sunday. Tom Sykes (GBR) was running third in the Superpole race until he was forced to retire shortly before the finish. In the afternoon’s second race, the Englishman finished sixth to claim another top-six result. Markus Reiterberger (GER) came home 13th and eleventh on Sunday. Sykes started the morning’s Superpole sprint from third place on the grid. He initially dropped back in the battle at the front of the field, however regained third place when two riders crashed in front of him. He went into the final lap with the next podium in sight, but was then forced to retire shortly before the finish when his engine suffered a mechanical issue. After ten laps of racing, Reiterberger crossed the finish line in 13th place. The results of the Superpole race meant that Sykes started the afternoon’s second race from eleventh place, ahead of Reiterberger in 14th. By the end of the second lap of the main race, the two RR riders had both made progress through the field. Sykes was eighth, while Reiterberger lay 12th. In the closing stages, Sykes rejoined the group battling for the third spot on the podium. He ultimately came home sixth, just 1.8 seconds outside the top three. Reiterberger also had a flawless ride to finish eleventh. Quotes after race two at Misano. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “On the whole, we can be very happy with the Misano weekend. It is obviously a shame that we were denied our next podium by a mechanical issue this morning. However, you must not forget that this kind of thing can always happen with a fledgling project like ours. We will analyse what the cause was. That is part of the learning process. The podium in Saturday’s race was the next important step with our new BMW S 1000 RR. The sprint and main race on Sunday allowed us to demonstrate the progress we have made with the development of the RR. The performance was spot on. If Tom had started from further up the grid in the afternoon, he could have challenged for a spot on the podium again. In the end, he missed out by under two seconds. However, his sixth place was another good result. The hard work also paid off for Markus and his crew. They took a step forward and this is the direction to go now. We now must continue this positive trend at Donington Park.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We are really gutted for Tom. He has put all his effort in and got very little reward for it in the sprint race when, with half a lap to go, he had a mechanical DNF when he could have been on the podium. That would also have meant third on the grid for the main race but he had to go from P11 on the grid and we all know that it’s difficult to pass the Ducatis in a straight line. He came within 1.8 seconds of the podium from 11th on the grid and I think that shows the talent and effort that he put in there. So, we apologise to Tom for not giving him the tools today. However, I think we can all see that there has been real progress and he is going to come back strong for sure at Donington. Markus, on the other hand, is still struggling to find his real form and we’re not yet where we want to be. We will look at all the data, sit down, discuss the set-up for Donington and hopefully cooler track temperatures will be very good towards our tyre wear and he and Tom can come back and do a good job at our home round.” Tom Sykes: “It was a little bit unfortunate. I really honestly feel that we had three podiums in reach. We were third in the sprint race until the last lap. We had an issue which allowed Leon Haslam to come close and then unfortunately we retired. That, was also unfortunate, meaning that I started the last big race from the fourth row which cost me some time in the first few laps. The whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team did a great job. We ran with our spare bike with a few performance compromises and we still had great pace. I feel if we had started from the front row we could have gone away, kept our rhythm and I definitely feel that this would have allowed another podium position. So a little bit of a shame but on the plus side we’ve had a podium, we finished second this weekend with the all-new BMW S 1000 RR, we are showing its potential. Even in this last race we had very good consistency. We will build on this.” Markus Reiterberger: “Today was better than yesterday, although my start was not so good in the Superpole race and a mistake cost me valuable time. The result was that I had to settle for 14th on the grid in race two. However, I made a good start and was able to hold on to 12th and later 11th place for the whole race. I did my best, did not make any mistakes, and brought the BMW S 1000 RR home safe and sound. The track conditions were more difficult today. It was very hot and I have never known there be so little grip. It was tough for everyone, but we coped well. We have taken a small step forward, which gives us more confidence. We will continue to work hard to improve. So a big thank you to the whole team.” \n"}

Jens Klingmann (GER), Peter Dumbreck (GBR), Alexandre Imperatori (SUI) and Stef Dusseldorp (NED) finished sixth overall. Victory went to the #4 Audi. The #33 car was the only BMW M6 GT3 in the top category, the SP9 class, to see the chequered flag at the endurance classic in the Eifel region of Germany. By nightfall, both ROWE Racing cars, the BMW Team Schnitzer BMW M6 GT3 and the #101 Walkenhorst Motorsport car were all out of the race as a result of crashes. The second Walkenhorst car then also crashed in the night, forcing it to retire. BMW teams did, however, enjoy success in many other classes. In the SP10 class, the Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport run #71 BMW M4 GT4 finished runner-up to take its place on the podium. The CUP5 class, which featured 13 BMW M240i Racings, was won by the Adrenalin Motorsport team and its #240 car. Further victories came in the SP4 (#325 BMW 325i, MRC RaceWorld), SP5 (#84 BMW 1M-Coupé, Leutheuser Racing&Events), V4 (#150 BMW 325i, Adrenalin Motorsport) and V2T (#162 BMW F30, Manheller Motorsport) classes. Quotes from the Nürburgring 24 Hours: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director): “Our teams had been looking forward to the Nürburgring 24 Hours for months. With 230,000 spectators, it provided a unique stage for the highlight of the GT season. We came to the Eifel track very well prepared – which makes this overall result in the SP9 class all the harder to take. I am pleased for FALKEN Motorsports, who managed to finish sixth overall with their BMW M6 GT3. However, the race came to a premature end for the other five BMW M6 GT3s. The fact is that you only have a chance here in the Green Hell if you get through the race without making any mistakes. We did not manage that. We have shown more than once recently that we are capable of winning a 24-hour race – whether at Spa-Francorchamps or Daytona. We lost this time in the top category on the Nordschleife. Despite this, we are still 100 percent behind this event. We had well over 40 cars in action. For us, it was once again a fantastic festival of customer racing. The competitiveness of our customer teams in classes like SP10 with the BMW M4 GT4, in which we finished second, was confirmation of our commitment to customer racing. I would like to congratulate all the teams for that. As far as the battle for overall victory is concerned, I have just one thing to say: We will come back stronger. Congratulations to Audi on their overall victory.” Jens Klingmann(#33 BMW M6 GT3, FALKEN Motorsports, 6th place): “We drove a clean race and didn't make any mistakes. Our speed was consistent but unfortunately it wasn't enough to move up through the field. However, when you consider that we had to start from 31st place, we managed to improve significantly with a nearly ideal race. Taking our situation into account, we can be pleased with sixth place, even though we had hoped for better results from BMW’s point of view.” Timo Scheider (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer, DNF): “I feel sorry for BMW and BMW Team Schnitzer. My crash was very unlucky. I had been behind the Hyundai for several corners and was able to pull past him in Brünnchen. Unfortunately, he didn’t see me and hit me.” Jesse Krohn (#99 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, DNF): “When I exited the pit lane I had a Porsche in front of me who was travelling slowly. I pulled up next to him and wanted to overtake him. In turn one, I drove as close to the inside as possible, but he cut in and there was contact. It is a great shame that this incident brought our race to an end.” Philipp Eng (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, DNF): “That was a frustrating 24-hour race. We only managed three and a half hours of it out on the track. However, that kind of thing happens, particularly on the Nordschleife. When I was in the car, it felt good and we were running in the top five.”\n"}

When the chequered flag was waved at Misano (ITA), the joy in the garage of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team knew no bounds. Tom Sykes (GBR) finished runner-up in Saturday’s race to claim the first podium for the new BMW S 1000 RR in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Despite racing in treacherous conditions, Sykes kept a cool head and was on course for a podium finish throughout the entire race which was red flagged due to rain. Team-mate Markus Reiterberger (GER) was 15th. Sykes laid the foundation for his podium result in the morning’s dry Superpole qualifying when he landed his RR on the front row of the grid in third place. However, patience was initially the order of the day in the afternoon. A heavy shower caused the start of the race to be delayed by 25 minutes. Sykes defended third place and held on to the position until inclement weather caused the race to be red flagged. The race eventually restarted after a break of almost half an hour. Sykes once again showed his wet-weather ability, not only keeping the chasing pack at bay, but also opening up a small gap to fourth place. When leader Alex Lowes (GBR \/ Yamaha) crashed out on lap nine of 18, Sykes adopted second position – and never looked at risk of losing that place. Reiterberger had finished 12th in Superpole qualifying. However, he fell back through the field in the opening stages of the race. After the interruption, he started the remaining 18 laps from 17th place. While many other riders crashed in the difficult conditions, Reiterberger guided his RR home in 15th place to pick up another world championship point. Quotes after race one at Misano. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: “Congratulations to Tom Sykes and the entire BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. It is fantastic that our fledgling project has been able to celebrate the first WorldSBK podium for the new BMW S 1000 RR at only the seventh event of the season. This is confirmation of the commitment, passion and hard work that everyone in the team has put into the project since we started out in the winter. I would like to say a big thank you to everyone. Tom gave a fantastic, commanding performance in the rain. And the team gave him a bike, in the RR, that was capable of a podium finish. We can be very proud of what we have achieved today.” Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We have achieved our first goal with the new BMW S 1000 RR in WorldSBK – we made it onto the podium. That is excellent, and the best possible reward for all the hard work the team has tirelessly put in. We set ourselves the goal of improving consistently towards the front of the field. With Tom’s second place today, we have taken the next step. The track conditions were far from easy today, but Tom and the team mastered this challenge superbly. We hope we can back up this success tomorrow. Markus had a difficult race, but tomorrow is a new day and we are confident that the tide will turn again for him.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We are absolutely delighted for everyone at BMW, for the whole project, for everyone in Germany and in Guisborough at SMR. It’s been a proper joint team effort and to have Dr. Markus Schramm, the Head of BMW Motorrad, here to witness that is absolutely fantastic. We took the gamble and did not go out with Tom this morning in the wet free practice three thinking it would be a dry afternoon, but the clouds opened up and it was wet all the way until the chequered flag came out. It was a very difficult, stressful period with the delayed start and the re-start. But anyway, we had a full 18-lap race and Tom thoroughly enjoyed riding in the wet and more than earned his P2 in the race. We’re absolutely excited. The downside is that Markus really had a difficult race. He got caught within the very back of the pack and there was a lot of spray and he ran off at turn eight. It was a tough day for Markus and he wants to put that behind him. But now we must celebrate the first podium for this new project. I think that is has come ahead of schedule and it’s certainly something that we should be proud of as the team. Hopefully we can build on this and keep the momentum going into tomorrow and into Donington Park.” Tom Sykes: “To say that I am very happy would be a slight understatement. I am very, very happy and it’s just credit to all the guys in the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. We’ve been working really hard and finally we’ve got the result which I feel we deserve. We’ve been pushing forward and it’s absolutely fantastic. I really enjoyed riding in the wet conditions. The BMW S 1000 RR gave me some great feedback today and what a better place to do that than here at Misano in front of some amazing fans. So we will try and keep that momentum together and try to get the results tomorrow. Thanks to all!” Markus Reiterberger: “Congratulations to Tom and the team on a superb result and the first podium for BMW. I was a little surprised that it rained this morning. However, I was happy about that, as I was quick in the rain during the test here. I gave it my all in Superpole, but it was only good enough for 12th on the grid. We just need to make a few more adjustments to the bike and my riding style. Unfortunately, the wet race was disappointing. I lost positions in the first part, as my starting position meant I had absolutely no visibility in the spray. I was then able to make up a few places in the second part of the race, but touched the white line during an overtaking manoeuvre, got my braking wrong and had to veer off into the gravel. After that, I just made sure I finished. Fortunately, I picked up a point.” \n"}

You have to stay calm and try not to play your way out of the tournament,” said the 34-year-old. “I am only five shots off the lead, so it is not an absolute nightmare. If I have a similar day tomorrow to the first two rounds then I might be able to make those ahead of me a little bit nervous.”Smith (-6 for the round), Fitzpatrick and Schwab (-7) demonstrated emphatically what is possible on any given day. With the wind stronger than on the previous days, and the greens softer and therefore easier following the rain, the trio hit birdie after birdie to move to the top of the leaderboard.“I have driven very well this week and hardly missed a fairway. That is the key when the greens are as hard as they were for the first two rounds. Today, the greens were very soft, which meant that you could attack them,” said Smith. “I really had my game under control today and feel right at home here in Germany.”Like Kaymer, defending champion Matt Wallace (ENG, -11, T4) and Lee Westwood (ENG, -10, T6), the 2003 BMW International Open winner, are still in with a chance of winning their second title at Germany’s most iconic tournament.With the exception of BMW Friend of the Brand Max Kieffer (-6), who climbed into a tie for 19th place, the remaining Germans who made the cut were unable to make up any ground on Saturday.

In the course of the pre-race programme of the tradition-steeped endurance event, which starts on the afternoon of 22 June 2019, they will have the opportunity to see a car that has already demonstrated absolute top-class performance in battling against both the clock and the challenges presented by this demanding race track. The new MINI John Cooper Works GP is currently completing set-up runs on the legendary Nürburgring-Nordschleife as part of its series development process. Although there is still plenty of time for fine-tuning until the market launch in 2020, the new extreme sports car in the model range of the British premium brand is already boasting lap times that are almost half a minute below the record set by its predecessor. At the 24-hour race, the MINI and John Cooper Works engineers will interrupt their testing programme for a short while to present the disguised prototype of the new MINI John Cooper Works GP to the public for the first time.The new MINI John Cooper Works GP will be produced next year in a limited edition of 3,000 units. With its high engine power, model-specific suspension technology harmonised with John Cooper Works motor racing expertise, weight-optimised construction and precisely defined aerodynamic properties, it sets a new benchmark in the small car segment. The fact that it takes the extreme driving fun offered by a MINI to a whole new level has already become amply clear in the course of tuning runs to date. The predecessor model set the previous benchmark at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife with a lap time of 8:23 minutes. The prototype of the new MINI John Cooper Works GP went round the legendary “Green Hell” in less than eight minutes – and its testing programme is not yet over.The prototype of the new MINI John Cooper Works GP won’t be pushing the limits during its demonstration run at the Nürburgring, but it will hardly be able to hide its outstanding sporting potential even when driven in moderate style. A more than 220 kW\/300 hp 4-cylinder engine with MINI TwinPower Turbo Technology under the bonnet makes for spirited sprint capacity and a captivating sound. Wide open air intakes, large light alloy wheels, the distinctive design of the front and rear aprons and the striking roof spoiler are its unmistakable features for inspiring performance characteristics – despite the disguise applied for testing purposes.Racing enthusiasts at the Nürburgring can look forward to enjoying hallmark MINI race feeling from three generations. The prototype of the new MINI John Cooper Works GP will carry out its demonstration runs together with its immediate predecessor and also the MINI Cooper S with John Cooper Works GP Kit, which was unveiled in 2006. These two top-class sports cars, each produced in a small series of 2,000 units, expressed pure racing passion right from the start, since going on to become coveted collectors' items. Their fascinating character is based on the concept of using the sporting MINI genes to develop a top-class athlete that is uncompromisingly focused on extreme driving pleasure – a principle that is taken to an even higher level by the new MINI John Cooper Works GP. \n"}

Some of our rivals improved massively in qualifying. We will now focus on a long race.” Jesse Krohn (#99 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 20th place): “The car actually felt good. We did not make any real mistakes, but just lost time here and there. I don’t really know where we are supposed to pick up seven seconds. However, one thing is clear, we will push and fight hard to make it a good race.” Tom Blomqvist (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 21st place): “That was the first time I’ve had the opportunity to drive in the Top Qualifying at the Nordschleife. It was a cool experience. My laps were good, even if I did lose some time in one or two places. Generally speaking, however, we did not have the pace to set the fastest lap times.” Jordan Tresson(#100 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport, 26th place): “We are a long way off pole position, and the tyres were not where I wanted them. So I struggled with grip. P26 is not what we had hoped for. However, we have a 24-hour race ahead of us, so we will remain positive and see what we can do tomorrow and on Sunday.”\n"}

On the Thursday before the start of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER), BMW Motorsport came together to commemorate Schnitzer team principal Charly Lamm, who died at the start of the year. At a special tribute event, BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt and a host of companions from more than 50 years of motorsport remembered Charly Lamm the person, as well as the many racing successes he enjoyed all over the world. Under Lamm’s leadership, Schnitzer Motorsport won the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring no fewer than five times. Marquardt led the tribute in the BMW M Motorsport Hospitality at the Nürburgring, which was attended by many well-known guests – including many current and former BMW works drivers, and rivals from various different racing series. “The news of Charly Lamm’s death at the start of the year came as a huge shock. Above all for his family and friends, of course, but also for the entire world of motorsport,” said Marquardt. “For decades, Charly was one of the greats of this world. This was shown emphatically by the incredible amount of international sympathy following his death. We are here today to remember Charly Lamm the fantastic team principal and all his many successes, but also a fantastic person.” Among those to speak at the event about the experiences they shared with Charly Lamm were former BMW Motorsport directors Mario Theissen and Gerhard Berger (CEO of ITR e.V.), Jochen Neerpasch (first managing director of BMW Motorsport GmbH), and Olaf Manthey (team principal and former BMW driver), as well as current BMW works drivers Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Bruno Spengler (CAN). Other quotes from the tribute event. Mario Theissen: “Charly was the best man I came across in the whole world of motorsport. And he was the most respected man. That is unique. What made him so special was that he gave every little detail his full attention. In the end, he was able to cope better with difficulties than the opposition. He did that better than anyone else.” Jochen Neerpasch: “Competition was what Charly lived for. You could call him at any time, he loved precision. He was one of the greats of motorsport – and for many decades he was the heart and soul of Schnitzer.” Gerhard Berger: “My best time as a racing driver was with Charly and Schnitzer. In motorsport, I have never met anyone else who, despite all the success, had remained such a fine person as Charly. His aura was unique. He was a very good friend. I will never forget him.” Augusto Farfus: “I will never forget Charly’s ability to put so much passion into something without ever asking for anything in return. The way he enjoyed motorsport, and the intensity, with which he partook in it, were unique. Charly never withheld any energy – he was always ready to help and to listen. I learned so much from him – and I miss him incredibly.” Bruno Spengler: “Charly never counted the hours – he just gave it everything from morning to evening. He motivated everyone around him. Charly gave me wings and led us to the DTM title in 2012.” Olaf Manthey: “We were both friends and rivals. Charly and Schnitzer were always respectful and fair to other teams. When I formed my company, my goal was to be just as successful as the Schnitzer team. He always encouraged me. There is simply nobody like him. Motorsport will remember Charly for a long time.” Profile:Charly Lamm.It was evident early on that Charly Lamm would follow his older half-brothers Josef and Herbert Schnitzer into motorsport. BMW and Schnitzer Motorsport have formed a successful alliance on the racetrack since the 1960s. Lamm soon found his place in the team and developed his own methods. Driven by passion, meticulousness and the desire to discover the world. “Our home in Freilassing is not the hub of the motorsport world,” he once said. This is where he always lived and worked. “However, it soon became apparent to me that I would have the opportunity with our racing team to travel and expand my horizon. I was incredibly excited by this prospect, and it dictated the rhythm of my life since I was a youngster. When we subsequently raced in America and Asia, I often packed my rucksack for another week and travelled around. That was a real privilege.” Even as a school pupil, lap times and set-up work determined the pace of Lamm’s life. “At secondary school, they did not see me very often on Fridays and Mondays,” he said. As a young man, Lamm used to tour the racetracks of this world with the Schnitzer team. He grew with his tasks. At first, he was the hardworking trainee, then team manager and chief decision maker. The list of successes that Schnitzer Motorsport achieved under Charly Lamm is a long one. And he always remained loyal to BMW: Lamm’s victories came exclusively with race cars or engines from Munich. In the 1980s, Schnitzer developed into the dominant team in touring car racing. Lamm repeatedly led the team to new success with the BMW M3. “We were the invincibles,” he said, describing those years. Victory in the World Touring Car Championship, success in the European Touring Car Championship, DTM triumph, titles in Italy, Great Britain and Asia, overall victory in the Super Touring Car Championship: Wherever Schnitzer was involved, it rained trophies. “We were on a run. The BMW M3 was phenomenal. Everything came together perfectly.” However, the “race of our lives”, as Lamm described it later, was still to come. In 1999, BMW won the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) with the Schnitzer team and the BMW V12 LMR. BMW Motorsport has won the iconic 24-hour race on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife 19 times, most recently in 2010. Once again it was Schnitzer who left the 24-hour race in the “Green Hell” victorious, having previous won in 1989, 1991, 2004 and 2005. In 2012, Lamm and Schnitzer were triumphant when BMW Motorsport returned to the DTM after an absence of 20 years. Bruno Spengler (CAN), the team and BMW won every title on offer. At the end of 2018, after more than 40 years in motor racing, Lamm bid farewell to the big stage. As humble as ever, but with one last hurrah: In November 2018, he won the FIA GT World Cup in Macau (CHN) with Augusto Farfus at the wheel of the BMW M6 GT3. This was Lamm’s final race as team principal, and his final race full stop.\n"}

The BMW International Open kicked off with impressive performances on the course and Bavarian flair around the tournament site. The 15,500 spectators who flocked to Golfclub München Eichenried particularly enjoyed a dazzling opening round of 67 (-5) from Germany’s top golfer, Martin Kaymer, who played his way into an excellent position going into round two. It is eleven years since Kaymer triumphed in Munich to become the first, and to this day only, German to win the BMW International Open. On Thursday, the two-time major winner remained bogey-free to set himself up nicely for an assault on title number two at Germany’s most iconic tournament. The 34-year-old underlined the impressive form he has shown recently with a controlled and virtually flawless performance. “It was great fun with the crowds. There were a lot of people out there, even in the morning – and a lot of kids, which is good to see. I made very few mistakes and putted well. Unfortunately, I did not put myself in good positions on the third, fourth and fifth, which are actually birdie holes. I could have picked up another shot or two there. There is still room for improvement, but I am very happy,” said Kaymer. “Compliments to Golfclub München Eichenried, the greens are perfect – the kind of greens a tournament like the BMW International Open deserves.”When the afternoon rounds were suspended due to a thunderstorm warning, Kaymer was tied for second place with England’s Oliver Wilson, one shot off the lead, which was held by Italian Andrea Pavan were also among the players who were able to finish their rounds in the morning.Many of the 15,500 spectators – the most ever recorded on a Thursday in the 31-year history of the tournament – had come dressed in Lederhosen or Dirndls. “Bavarian Day” served up a feast of Bavarian hospitality, including traditional oompah music and snacks in the tournament’s own beer garden, as well as world-class golf.\n"}

This coming weekend, the ABB FIA Formula E Championship will be in Bern (SUI) for the first time, for the eleventh race of the season. Our preview provides you with the most importance facts about the circuit and the key factors for a successful Julius Baer Swiss E-Prix. TRACK FACTS BERN.Circuit length2.750 km. Anticlockwise.Corners8 left and 6 right handers. Slowest corner: under 50 km\/h. Fastest corner: approx. 90 km\/h.Track surfaceProbably very uneven, alternating surfaces.Grip levelLow. Leaves may make the track slippery and be a disadvantage for qualifying group 1.Circuit layoutVery demanding. Relatively high average speed. Therefore, relatively high energy consumption. Great differences in altitude (up to 50 metres). Relatively high top speed on a downhill section (approx. 225 km\/h). Several straights, but a very narrow track make overtaking very difficult.Tyre wearLikely to be high. Narrow chicanes and long straights mean lots of stopping and starting on the track.Attack ZoneATTACK MODE is activated on a straight. This means there will be hardly any time loss.Pit laneVery long and narrow.Risk of crashesVery high due to the narrow, demanding track.Key factorsGood starting position, great efficiency of drive train, good and exact energy management. Quotes ahead of the Julius Baer Swiss E-Prix: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“Bern as a venue is uncharted territory for every Formula E team. In the first instance, this poses organisational and logistical challenges for us because we need to get to grips with a new environment. From a racing perspective we have some simulation data, but will only really be able to tell what is in store once we get there. This is good news for Alexander Sims, since as a Formula E rookie this time he will be starting the race weekend on exactly the same basis as his experienced rivals. We hope that the track will suit us and that we can end the European season on a high.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18):“It feels good to be coming to Bern with a top ten result in Berlin under my belt. The circuit there will be new for everybody, so we are all starting under the same conditions. The goal must be to get used to the conditions as quickly as possible and to have a steep learning curve. At first glance, the track looks very tight and has plenty of climbs and descents. It is very different to the circuit in Berlin. I am excited about the challenge as Formula E provides new surprises from race to race.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18):“Bern is the last race before the grand season finale in New York. Looking at the championship, it is especially important to record a good result there and hopefully be involved in the battle for the win. The circuit looks very exciting but we will only get a real feeling for it when we are there, as none of us have driven in Bern before. Switzerland was a great host last year, so I am really looking forward to the race.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race. The five drivers with the most FANBOOST votes are awarded a significant burst of power, which they can deploy in a five-second window during the second half of the race.

An enjoyable cycle ride through the English Garden in glorious weather, on BMW Bikes from the latest BMW Lifestyle Collection, and a team golf competition at the Seehaus: The opening of the BMW International Open 2019 (GC München Eichenried, 19th to 23rd June) was a star-studded affair, held in good spirits on Tuesday evening. Golf stars Martin Kaymer, Sergio García, Matt Wallace and Thorbjørn Olesen were joined by BMW M Brand Ambassador Lena Gercke, actor Jan Josef Liefers, Olympic luge champion Felix Loch, and BMW works driver Bruno Spengler, who gave the “Tee-Off Night” the glamour it deserved.The bicycle and rickshaw tour took the group from the official player hotel, the Hilton Munich Park, through the English Garden, a famous Munich landmark and one of the largest parks in the world. The stars were in high spirits by the time they arrived at the Seehaus, where they were given a warm welcome by Pro-Am guests at the “Tee-Off Night”, and reached for their golf clubs.The competition was played in teams of two. While each pro had to play an approach shot from the specially-erected bunker, the job of putting was left to their celebrity partner. The pairing of Johannes Lochner and Martin Kaymer came out on top, needing just two shots. Quotes from the opening of the BMW International Open. Martin Kaymer (two-time major champion and 2008 BMW International Open winner): “I am always impressed by how much effort BMW goes to, to ensure that everything runs smoothly. BMW does a very good job every year. The bunker shot was obviously just a bit of fun. I put the ball on the green and Johannes put it in. It is a nice way to start a tournament week.”Sergio García (major champion and the most successful player in Ryder Cup history):“That was a fantastic experience. It is hard to beat in this weather. I was amazed how many people turned out and simply enjoyed the day. The tour was very nice and really good fun. It was great to see how much fun everyone was having.”Matt Wallace (BMW International Open defending champion): “The evening was fantastic. I have never done a tour like that before. I must praise the whole organisation team for this magnificent event. Cycling through the park and then the bunker shot in front of 100 or more people was obviously a great start to the tournament week. We all enjoyed the summer evening here in Munich, with good food and great music.”Lena Gercke (BMW M Brand Ambassador): “I think I am a better cyclist than golfer. It was wonderful, and we had such a great day with perfect weather. The English Garden is a dream. It is just great fun to be outdoors in this weather. We did a short cycling tour, then arrived at the Seehaus and did a bit of putting. That is not necessarily one of my strengths, as I am not really the greatest golfer. Nor do I think I ever will be. However, it was a great honour for me to be among so many top golfers this evening.”Jan Josef Liefers (actor and star of the series Tatort): “If I have counted correctly, I believe this is my fifth time at the BMW International Open. The opening was particularly successful this year. I lived in Munich for five years, so I know the area around the English Garden like my own back yard. I lived in this region, so I spent a lot of time here. I like the fact that we are here now, and that we are not completely shielded from outside, but that we have half Munich around us. I like the way the people of Munich welcome the sun and enjoy just sitting together.”Johannes Lochner (bobsleigh world champion and world cup winner): “It was another superb experience. The cycling tour through the English Garden was almost too far for a bobsleigh driver, but I just about made it. The contest alongside Martin was hard to beat. When you watch one of the best, it rubs off on you. Plus, I work best under pressure. We had great weather, the people there were friendly, and I am now very excited about the Pro-Am.”Bruno Spengler (BMW works driver and 2012 DTM champion): “It was super cool. I already knew Sergio, Martin and Matt, because I have played Pro-Ams with them in Wentworth, Cologne and Paris. That was great fun, and we know each other well as a result. As a huge golf fan, I am obviously delighted to be here. The cycling tour was also great fun. I think it is fantastic how committed BMW is to golf.”Felix Loch (Olympic champion, world champion, and world cup winner in the luge): “The cycling tour through the English Garden was something completely different. When else would I do that? It was really pleasant and the weather was spot on. It was a dream day. It was great fun with the guys. I know one or two of them quite well now. It was great in the Seehaus too – particularly in this weather. It is far more pleasant than in the winter, when it is -10 on the luge run.”\n"}

On the whole, however, we are looking forward to going to Misano, from where we can hopefully return with some strong performances.” Tom Sykes: “I am very much looking forward to the Misano round of the Superbike World Championship. It’s always a pleasure to race in Italy and of course it’s on the back of a two-day test there. It was certainly worth doing the test in preparation for the race and obviously I have quite high expectations with the BMW S 1000 RR chassis. I really hope we can have a very consistent weekend and the target is to try to finish in the top five in all three races. I am certainly trying my best along with the entire BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team to try and secure some podiums now and hopefully get the one that we were so close to at Imola. That would be great for the whole team.” Markus Reiterberger: “Misano is a cool circuit, which I really like. Last year, we were very successful and won there with the Superstock bike. After the test there a few weeks ago, we are prepared for anything the weather can throw at us. I think our bike will perform well there. I obviously hope that the weather is nice, but not too hot, and that we have an awesome weekend. A lot of friends and fans from my part of the world will travel there, as the event is very popular. I am really looking forward to it. At the same time, I am obviously focussing fully on the race.” \n"}

A total of 45 BMW race cars have been registered for the 24-hour race – including the current BMW M4 GT4 and BMW M240i Racing customer racing cars and many other BMW models competing for privateer teams from all around the world. On Thursday, the event programme includes a tribute to Charly Lamm from the BMW M Motorsport family, following his death at the start of the year. The six BMW M6 GT3s at the 47th edition of the Eifel marathon are competing for BMW Team Schnitzer, ROWE Racing, Walkenhorst Motorsport and FALKEN Motorsports. Numerous BMW works drivers will take their places in the cockpits. Having raced at Le Mans last weekend, Nick Catsburg (NED), Philipp Eng (AUT), Augusto Farfus (BRA), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Martin Tomczyk (GER) will switch immediately from the BMW M8 GTE to the BMW M6 GT3. Alongside the BMW M6 GT3s, there will also be five BMW M4 GT4s and 13 BMW M240i Racings in competition. The 2018 BMW Sports Trophy winners – Christopher Rink, Danny Brink and Philipp Leisen (all GER) – will be joined by Nordschleife expert Dirk Adorf (GER) in the #77 BMW M4 GT4, sporting a special BMW M Motorsport design and the BMW Sports Trophy logo. At 17:00 on Thursday, BMW Motorsport will be hosting a tribute event at BMW M Motorsport Hospitality in the paddock in memory of Charly Lamm.

There is a particularly close connection between this 24-hour race and BMW. That is why the Nürburgring is also the perfect location to honour Charly Lamm one more time. He loved this race and celebrated five wins there with his team. The BMW M Motorsport family will be driving for Charly at the weekend. He will be in our hearts.” Augusto Farfus (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer): “The 24-hour race at the Nürburgring is one of the best events of the whole year - and it is my personal favourite race. We have been waiting for the next overall win there for a few years. This year, our set-up is better than at almost any time before. Our level of expectation and motivation is correspondingly high. Coming straight from Le Mans to compete at the Nürburgring is challenging. I am looking forward to this challenge and have prepared as well as I can.” Martin Tomczyk (#42 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Team Schnitzer): “The Nürburgring 24 Hours is a real classic race on the GT calendar and it is also an enormously important race for me. I have driven there so often and I have come really close a few times - but I have never quite managed to win, so I am hoping to be challenging this year with BMW Team Schnitzer. The preparation races showed that we have a good pace.” Connor De Phillippi (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “The 24-hour race at the Nürburgring has had a very special place in my heart since my overall win in 2017. With ROWE Racing, we have two cars competing with very strong driver line-ups. I can hardly wait for it start.” Philipp Eng (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “I am really looking forward to the race.

It is certainly a physical and mental challenge but that is exactly what you want to have as a racing driver.” Nick Catsburg (#99 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “To me, the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring is one of the best events of the season. It’s the track I like the most. The BMW M6 GT3 is always great there, so we can approach the race weekend in the knowledge that we are competitive.” Jesse Krohn (#99 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “As always, expectations are very high when you compete at this circuit in a BMW.

The team has done a great job and the preparations are going well.” Nick Yelloly (#101 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport): “I can hardly wait to compete in my first 24-hour race. I can think of no better place for the race than the Nürburgring. I am very proud to be representing the BMW brand there. My driver team-mates and the Walkenhorst team have plenty of experience on the Nordschleife and I am sure that we have the potential to record a good result. Winning the qualification race was a fantastic result during preparation. I hope that we can build on this.” Jens Klingmann (#33 BMW M6 GT3, FALKEN Motorsports): “This race is the highlight of my 2019 racing calendar. Naturally, our objective is to regain the crown for BMW in the ‘Green Hell’ for the first time since 2010. This will be my second start for FALKEN Motorsports. I am expecting a very intense race that requires you to drive every lap at the limit. I think we are set up really well for this.” Note to editors: Accredited media representatives wishing to attend the tribute event in memory of Charly Lamm should send an e-mail to: ingo.lehbrink@bmw.de.\n"}

The greens make an excellent impression and you can almost compare them to figure skating ice. We play a tournament every year for the YoungWings foundation and last year we auctioned off the round with Marcel, Philipp and me. Many thanks to Christian for winning the auction and thanks to the organisers for allowing us to play here. It is so much fun!”Philipp Lahm: “We only played nine holes but Thomas always needs more help from me than I do from him. But Thomas is still in perfect condition and I’m sure he can still make it around the back nine. So far, we have managed to keep the deficit down to a reasonable level.”Marcel Siem: “I have never seen the golf course in such good condition - massive congratulations are in order for the whole team. We will certainly see some different scores this year, as the greens are harder and allow the setting of more difficult pin positions. As a young Eichenrieder back then, I am very proud to present a fantastic German course like this to the international players. I am looking forward to the BMW International Open.”\n"}

What does the new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure look like? That’s the question the BMW Vision M NEXT, preparing for its presentation in Munich in a few days’ time, seeks to answer. As part of a collaboration with the BMW Group, artist Thomas Demand has produced a series of photographs which pull back the covers on some early details of the car – without removing them completely. This is not the first time Demand and the BMW Group have got together. Back in 2000 the BMW Group commissioned Demand to create a piece for the prestigious AutoWerke collection, which saw 28 internationally renowned artists including Candida Höfer, Wolfgang Tillmans, Thomas Struth and Demand himself turn their attentions to the themes of cars and mobility. And now Demand has refocused his materials and medium of choice – papier, cardboard and photography – on a new subject area: the mobility of the future.“Like most artists, I’m fascinated by things we haven’t seen before, images still to be discovered. So I was delighted to accept the invitation of Adrian van Hooydonk and his team. I think the way I look at photography puts me in a good place to bring out essential, abstract elements. The M NEXT study is a highly complex vehicle whose radical design extends beyond the job description of an everyday model. A concept like this represents a very interesting opportunity for me to transport these ideas and future forms into the public consciousness.” Thomas Demand. The new era of Sheer Driving Pleasure.The shape and substance of future mobility are the forces behind both the BMW Vision iNEXT and BMW’s latest Vision Vehicle: the BMW Vision M NEXT. Where the BMW Vision iNEXT shows us the ways in which autonomous driving will change life on board our vehicles, the BMW Vision M NEXT demonstrates how technology can be harnessed to enhance driving pleasure. In the new age of mobility, intelligent technologies will fuel sporty driving and the person at the wheel will be turned into the ultimate driver.Whether it’s the relaxation of EASE driving in the BMW Vision iNEXT or a dynamic BOOST experience at the helm of the BMW Vision M NEXT, in both cases people – and their emotions and needs – take centre stage, design and technology enriching the desired driving experience.“When we reveal a new vehicle, there are myriad overall views at play. This time we’re taking a new approach and presenting a selection of artworks ahead of the car’s unveiling. The photos are fascinating and tell their own story. They are very close to the BMW Vision Vehicle and yet completely abstract, pure art. They will only become tangible when you set eyes on the Vision Vehicle itself.” Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design Down to details.Thomas Demand and Adrian van Hooydonk hold one another in high regard and regularly take time to discuss all things urban and future mobility-related. It therefore made sense for the BMW Group to give Demand a sneak preview of the BMW Vision M NEXT and invite the inspiration to flow. The artist duly picked out various details and created paper and cardboard models based on them. These provided the focal point for the photographs that followed. Demand’s concept here is based on the actual colour scheme and visual forms of the BMW Vision M NEXT. However, he zooms in so closely on the surface of the vision vehicle that his paper and cardboard models become removed from the subject matter at hand. His endeavours are encapsulated in four works which stay very close to the details of the BMW Vision M NEXT and yet also represent abstract photographic art. Audiences will have to wait until the presentation of the BMW Vision M NEXT in Munich later this month to see the art fleshed out into tangible reality.\n"}

Augusto Farfus (BRA) recorded a decisive time improvement in the lap time at the start of the final night qualifying session. BMW Team MTEK’s second car, #81, finished 16th. The BMW M8 GTE was damaged when Nick Catsburg (NED) went off eleven minutes into the third session. He was unable to continue qualifying, meaning that the time of 3:51.353 minutes from the previous sessions was recorded as final. Pole position went to the #95 Aston Martin. Catsburg, Martin Tomczyk (GER) and Philipp Eng (AUT) will share driving duties during the race in the #81 car. Farfus, António Félix da Costa (POR), and Jesse Krohn (FIN) will be competing in the #82 BMW M8 GTE. Tradition dictates that no driving takes place on the Friday in Le Mans. The highlight of the day is the Drivers’ Parade during the afternoon, which is once again set to delight racing fans from all around the world in the heart of the town. The Saturday in Le Mans then gets going with the warm-up from 09:00 to 09:45, before the field comes together at 15:00 for the 87th edition of the classic endurance race. Reactions to qualifying for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Ernest Knoors (Team Principal, BMW Team MTEK):“It was a bit of a mixed bag, to be honest. Both cars were in the mix and higher than where we thought they would be. We got the maximum we could – we knew we would not be capable of fighting at the sharper end. Car #81 was unlucky but we’d rather have it happen today than at the weekend. We’re looking forwarded to pushing hard and racing to our full potential.” Augusto Farfus (#82 BMW M8 GTE):“We’re pleased with what we have achieved in qualifying. Fifth place is reasonable – there’s not a lot more we could have done. We have 24 hours to move forward so we’re happy. It’s a shame for the #81 car but it shows the level of commitment we need to get a good qualifying lap.” Nick Catsburg (#81 BMW M8 GTE): “Obviously, that’s not what you want to happen just before the race. I made a mistake which ended qualifying. The lap I was on was for a top-five result which was better than expected. We have to work hard in the race but this team can do it.” \n"}

BMW OPERA NEXT will make use of the opportunities presented by digitalisation to open up fresh perspectives and new ways of accessing the world of opera for young audiences.What does the backstage area of an opera house look like? In which ways is opera relevant for cities and the society in general? What happens when musicians give impromptu concerts at unexpected venues? What happens in the very last seconds before the curtain is lifted? What is the perspective of the conductor, who are the musicians of the ensemble Staatskapelle Berlin and what does the opera of the future look like?With new series for social media channels, creating interactive selfie spots in front of the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, BMW and Staatsoper Unter den Linden will be developing new formats offering a variety of insights into the exciting and multi-faceted world of opera and its backstage areas. To that end, they will expand their streaming services as well as create a stronger presence across the various social media networks.For further information regarding all content of BMW OPERA NEXT, please visit the blog of Staatsoper Unter den Linden https:\/\/blog.staatsoper-berlin.de\/kategorie\/bmwoperanext\/ and #BMWOperaNext.#ChangeYourViewThe Audience can already experience fresh perspectives at “State Opera for All” on next Saturday. On June 15, 2019, the prelude to “Tristan and Isolde” will be shown from a unique viewpoint: a \"mini-camera\" placed on the torso of conductor Daniel Barenboim will present audiences on site and the world via live streaming the opportunity to experience the musicians live at work from the maestro’s vantage point for the very first time. During the live stream, online audiences will also have the opportunity to adopt additional perspectives such as a 360° bird’s eye view of the stage area, the prompter’s perspective and the view from the lighting bridge or the conductor’s stand. The guests in the opera house will also be able to watch how the Bebelplatz will fill up with tens of thousands of spectators.#OutOfTheOperaFollowing their analogue tradition, the musicians of Staatskapelle Berlin will perform at Berlin’s favourite hot spots: once a month, the ensemble will leave behind the concert hall and orchestra pit of Staatsoper Unter den Linden to play at the city’s favourite bars offering concerts free of charge across the capital. The format offers audiences the opportunity to experience first-rate music in a relaxed setting outside of the concert hall while being given a chance to talk with the ensemble’s musicians. Following a successful opening session at Bar Tausend in January 2019, the performers moved on to play at Mein Haus am See in Berlin‑Mitte, Ludwig Bar in Berlin‑Neukölln, Moritz Bar in Berlin‑Wedding and Zosse Bar in Berlin‑Rixdorf. The final 30-minute concert of the series #OutOfTheOpera will be held on June 17, 2019, at Klunkerkranich in Berlin‑Neukölln. The series will be continued featuring monthly pop-up appearances in the upcoming 2019\/20 season with video recordings of previous evening performances deliberately published on social media channels only. In addition, #OutOfTheOpera invites its audiences to share their experience and impressions live online and video recordings of the evening shows will be used to announce upcoming events. All posts created by members of the audience will be entered into a draw to win tickets for performances at Staatsoper Unter den Linden or concerts of Staatskapelle Berlin.#OperaOfTheFutureAs part of the concept, the creators of the initiative plan on developing content for the digital future of opera in the spring of 2020. During the conference on design, lifestyle and digital worlds (DLD) held in Munich in 2020, experts from the various fields of composition and digital production, together with BMW’s very own sound engineers, will debate questions regarding new technologies and opportunities of the opera of the future.The new series for social mediachannels include for example #AskMatthias: The opera house’s new artistic director Matthias Schulz will respond to questions from the audience via short video clips posted on social media. Influencer Elisa Schenke asked, “What do you find most disrupting when attending a performance at the opera?” He said, „When someone unwraps a piece of candy in a very slow manner making a lot of rustling noises in the process…”. In the new series #OperaMatters emerging talents of Berlin’s pop culture will address questions such as “Do you believe in love at first sight?” or “What are you willing to do for power?”, illustrating how these topical questions are relevant in both everyday-life and great operas such as “The Magic Flute” and “Rigoletto”. With Celebrities including Langston Uibel, Loco Candy, Haiyti, Visa Vie, Zsá Zsá Inci Bürkle, Sebastian Zimmerhackl, Lipa, Andy Kassier, Cheyenne Tulsa, Josephine Kinsey, Romano, Lary, Search Yiu, Jan Koeppen, Michail Stangl and Kaan Bulak.Asked about the new digital partnership, Matthias Schulz, General Manager of Staatsoper Unter den Linden, said, “It is a matter close to my heart that Staatsoper Unter den Linden is perceived as a place where audiences can experience something truly unique with all their senses, even without being aficionados. ‘State Opera for All’ has been a wonderful example of exactly this idea for the last 13 years! Which is also why I am very pleased that we will take our next steps together with BMW as our main partner to create a digital partnership. We want to use digital means and social media channels to open up fresh perspectives and offer new insights into the world of opera. In so doing, we want to become more accessible, pique people’s curiosity and welcome them at our opera house for live performances. In addition to the many new communication channels, this cooperation will also focus on questions regarding the future of opera as an art form in a world of digital innovation. I am very much looking forward to this exchange of ideas!”Daniel Barenboim, Musical Director of Staatsoper Unter den Linden, added, “I am very much looking forward to end this season together with the people of Berlin and all its visitors celebrating a weekend featuring ‘State Opera for All’ at Bebelplatz, the ‘city’s largest concert hall’. I am particularly pleased that our remarkable 26-year old concert master Jiyoon Lee will perform as solo artist at the symphonic concert given by Staatskapelle Berlin on Sunday. This musical event will present an exclusive programme: in addition to Brahms, we will be playing the Violin Concerto in E Minor, Op. 64 by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, who personally used to conduct the orchestra! We are excited that BMW will continue to be our main partner for ‘State Opera for All’ and join us in finding new ways of addressing a wide public while getting them excited about opera and classical music.”“Opera has been a favourite of the people for over 400 years. We have been fans of the opera for as much as almost half a century. As long-standing partner of Staatsoper Unter den Linden we are very pleased to also bring our know-how and networks to the new initiative BMW OPERA NEXT, as digital transformation is not only vital for the future success of our company, but also makes possible a change of perspectives at the opera.

An international jury selected Lu Yang unanimously from a shortlist of three artists whose works were exhibited in the Discoveries sector at this year’s Art Basel show in Hong Kong. Lu Yang is represented by the gallery Société in Berlin.Lu Yang’s BMW Art Journey “Human Machine Reverse Motion Capture Project” is concerned with how the human body can be trained to overcome its physical limitations. Her research will explore the deployment of the human body in historical and present-day cultures, looking at traditional and contemporary dances practiced in Indonesia, India, and Japan. Steeped in the latest digital technologies, Lu Yang will employ sophisticated motion capture devices to record the dancers’ gestures, including facial, finger- and eye-capture techniques that can collect and analyze the subtlest body movements, and will mimic these using robotic technologies.In Legong, a traditional Balinese dance, for example, movement is controlled to such a degree that dancers are able to manipulate their finger joints individually. The facial and eye movements of India’s Kathakali dancers resemble the workings of sensors and motors in advanced humanoid robots. A similar robotic precision is expressed in the Japanese pop dances. Thus, Lu Yang’s BMW Art Journey links traditional and modern cultural forms to radically transformative contemporary technologies. In a larger sense, it will look into how we negotiate our evolving relationship with machines that may ultimately surpass our human limitations. “Thank you for giving me the opportunity to start a project that I’ve always wanted to do. The BMW Art Journey gives a great starting point for long-term research projects. This is not just an art journey. It will be a wonderful start for me to open a new chapter of my creation. I am very much looking forward to this future collaboration and the art-making after this journey. I would also like to thank the gallery Société in Berlin for fully supporting me”, says Lu Yang.The international jury consisted of Claire Hsu, Director, Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong; Matthias Mühling, Director, Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau, Munich; Patrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, President Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, Turin; Philip Tinari, Director Ullens Center for Contemporary Art (UCCA), Beijing; and Samson Young, artist and winner of the first BMW Art Journey.“What we found exciting about Lu Yang’s proposal and work,” the jury noted in its statement, “is the way she draws connections across time, space, and geography – traversing different realms – from Kathakali and Legong dance to Japanese pop with our potential future robotic selves. She demonstrates that humanity’s search for an answer to why we are here is continuous – it just takes different forms.” The proposed BMW Art Journey evokes urgent dilemmas in today’s society, the jury noted. “We appreciated the idea that the vocabulary within the database used for robotic human expressions would be expanded to include the expressions found in multiple traditions – a much needed expansion of reference points in today’s world.”Lu Yang was announced as the next BMW Art Journey winner at the BMW Cocktail Reception during Art Basel in Basel. Art Basel and BMW will collaborate with the artist to document the journey and share it with a broader public through print publications, online and social media.In addition to Lu Yang, the shortlisted artists from the Discoveries sector for emerging artists at Art Basel in Hong Kong were: Clarissa Tossin (represented by Commonwealth and Council, Los Angeles) and Shen Xin (represented by Madeln Gallery, Shanghai).Launched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging artists worldwide. The unique award is open to artists who are exhibiting in the Discoveries sector during Art Basel in Hong Kong. A judging panel comprised of internationally renowned experts meet first to select a shortlist three artists from the sector, who are then invited to submit proposals for a journey aimed to further develop their ideas and artistic work. The jury reconvenes to choose a winner from the three proposals.The BMW Art Journey has been awarded seven times to date. Previous winners include: sound and performance artist Samson Young (presented by a.m. Space, Hong Kong at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2015), who represented Hong Kong at the 2017 Venice Biennale; German video artists Henning Fehr and Philipp Rühr (presented by Galerie Max Mayer, Dusseldorf at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2015); British artist Abigail Reynolds (presented by Rokeby, London at Art Basel's show in Hong Kong in 2016) as well as Max Hooper Schneider (presented by High Art, Paris at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2016), Astha Butail (presented by GALLERYSKE, New Dehli, Bangalore at Art Basel´s Hong Kong show in 2017), Jamal Cyrus (presented by Inman Gallery, Houston at Art Basel´s Miami Beach show in 2017), and Zac Langdon-Pole (presented by Michael Lett, Auckland at Art Basel’s show in Hong Kong in 2018).BMW is a global partner of Art Basel and has supported Art Basel’s three shows in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong Kong for many years.For further information about the artist and the project, please visit:www.bmw-art-journey.com\n"}

The Austrian started race six of the season from ninth place. After an impressive fightback and clever tyre management, he came home second in the ZF BMW M4 DTM. ->","completion":" This was Eng’s third podium result of the year, and the 290thin the history of the touring car series for BMW. In total, four BMW drivers finished in the top ten. Joel Eriksson (SWE) was sixth in the CATL BMW M4 DTM, while Bruno Spengler (CAN) ended the race eighth in the BMW Bank M4 DTM. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) followed him home in ninth. Wittmann and Timo Glock (GER) both reached a very special milestone at Misano on Sunday. Both drivers were starting the 100thDTM race of their careers. The two BMW drivers both made their debut in the touring car series at the opening round of the 2013 season at Hockenheim and have since driven both the BMW M3 DTM and the BMW M4 DTM. Wittmann has 13 wins, 12 pole positions and two DTM titles to his name. Glock has secured five pole positions and climbed onto the top step of the podium on five times to date. However, the 100thrace came to a premature end for both Wittmann and Glock. Wittmann crashed out following a collision on lap one, for which he was in no way to blame. Technical issues forced Glock to retire in the JiVS BMW M4 DTM. Reactions to the sixth DTM race of the 2019 season at Misano. Rudolf Dittrich (General Manager BMW Motorsport Vehicle Development): “All in all, it has been a weekend of highs and lows. The highlight was obviously Marco Wittmann’s victory on Saturday, when he launched a stunning fightback from last on the grid to take a sensational victory. And Philipp Eng’s impressive performance on Sunday, with some nice overtaking manoeuvres and great tyre management, was also a great advertisement for the DTM. However, we also struggled with some issues at Misano. Our performance in both qualifying sessions was not ideal. Furthermore, Wittmann and Timo Glock were both forced out of their 100thDTM race far too early on Sunday. Marco was unnecessarily wiped out in the early stages of the race. Timo had to return to the garage with technical issues early on. We would have liked a different outcome for both of them in their milestone race. In total, however, we had five cars in the top ten on Saturday and four on Sunday. That is a respectable result. Congratulations to Nico Müller and Audi on their win.” Bart Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“It was an exciting race – the first in dry conditions without a safety car. Given our grid positions, we did not necessarily expect to make so much progress in the race. As such, I am very happy with the result, the podium for Philipp Eng, and the good points haul for the championship. Joel Eriksson also climbed through the field to finish sixth. Sheldon van der Linde did a super-long stint and also made it into the points. Well done, guys!” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 9th, Race: 2nd, Drivers’ standings: 2nd, 83 points):“I am incredibly proud of everyone. There is no guarantee that you can finish runner-up from ninth place on the grid. As such, I am really happy with the result. We did everything right. In hindsight, I could possibly have pushed a little earlier, as my tyres were in good condition. Then I could have attacked Nico Müller. However, he was probably too far in front. We must look to see whether my DRS was working properly all the time. Otherwise, we could possibly have done even better. On the whole, however, I am extremely happy.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 8th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 9th, 28 points):“It was quite a good race. I struggled a little at the start. That is why we changed the tyres. After the pit stop, I still had a few problems with the tyres, but managed to cope with that. I then pulled off a good manoeuvre on the final lap to pass Jonathan Aberdein. Generally speaking, they are good points for BMW and I am now looking forward to the next race weekend.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 11th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings:11th, 25 points):“I am happier than I was yesterday, even though the result may not necessarily reflect that. The pace was really good today. We stopped early, then I battled through to the finish and tried to keep everyone else behind me. I am satisfied with ninth place yesterday and then again today.” Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“Today, our luck was the polar opposite to yesterday. Timo Glock had a technical issue with his car. You could see for yourself what happened to Marco Wittmann. I think he would definitely have finished on the podium. You obviously can’t do anything about an unnecessary crash like that. We did manage to get Bruno Spengler to climb a few places in the race, and are obviously happy about that. The team once again did a super job this weekend.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 6th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 4th 68 points):“It is really annoying to crash out in that manner. I cannot say too much on the subject and am obviously totally frustrated. It is disappointing to end my 100thDTM race that way, particularly after the great start and good opening lap.” Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 13th, Race: 8th, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 40 points):“To climb from 13thto eighth – without any particular incidents, like the appearance of a safety car – was really good. It would have been really difficult to get any more out of the race. I was held up by Mike Rockenfeller a little for a while. That cost me a little time. Maybe seventh or sixth place might just have been possible. But that’s life. We had a few difficulties in qualifying this morning. We need to analyse that and improve for next time. If we can manage to start from further up the field, it will probably be a different story.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 10th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 21 points):“We had problems from the very start. Then the engine suddenly lost power and we tried to repair it. We did manage, but that landed me well behind everyone else. I just wanted to see if it was working. However, the car then started to shift back into first gear when I was in second. Once that started happening, my race was over. Only a cold beer on the beach can help me now.”\n"}

Round six of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Jerez de La Frontera (ESP) concluded with the Superpole Race and the Sunday race for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Tom Sykes (GBR) claimed another top-five result with the BMW S 1000 RR, finishing fifth in the Superpole Race. That result meant Sykes started the afternoon’s main race from fifth on the grid. When Chaz Davies (GBR) and Marco Melandri (ITA) collided in front of him on lap six, Sykes moved up into fourth place, however, he then dropped several positions after a mistake on lap nine. The race was then suspended on lap 18 following a crash and Sykes was classified in seventh place. Team-mate Markus Reiterberger (GER) ended the Superpole Race in 15th place. Like Sykes, he struggled for grip in the main race and eventually came home twelfth. Misano (ITA) hosts the next round of the 2019 WorldSBK season in two weeks. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is familiar with the circuit, having tested there in the run-up to Jerez de la Frontera. Quotes after race two at Jerez de la Frontera. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We can see the progress we are continuously making with the new BMW S 1000 RR. For various reasons, however, we are still unable to convert this progress into corresponding results in all the races. That is why we had such a mixed weekend at Jerez. Given the fact that some of the top riders failed to finish, we should have been capable of far better results in today’s main race. However, both riders had grip issues. We will now analyse that and find out what caused it. On the plus side, Tom was able to score some valuable points and Markus’ feel for the bike improved. We have to build on that now. At the same time, development of the new RR continues and we hope to be able to take the next step at Misano.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The Superpole race was really strong from Tom. He was on the SCX which was good for the race distance. We were really happy with that fifth position which set him up for a good start in the main race. That main race was quite difficult for Tom as he was suffering from lack of grip. His lap times were quicker than in race one but that also was the case with everyone else. He finished P7 but without the retirements in the field it would have been probably more a P10. Equally for Markus, he had a difficult day. So after a promising start to the weekend the Sunday did not go too well but we will come back stronger at Misano.” Tom Sykes: “All things considered, I really feel that we had a decent set of results. I’m a little bit disappointed with race two. I had a big moment in the fast last right hander. I lost the front with 170 km\/h and the slide was over fifty metres so it was lucky that we were able to save it. I was able to catch up with the guys again but wasn’t able to pass. Overall, I think we had some decent results given where we are with the performance of the engine. We’re continuing to collect information for moving forward. So now my expectations are to keep the program developing towards the podium. That’s the ultimate target. When you look at the team, the manufacturer and the riders, we have high potential but obviously just for now we need to sit back and understand what we’ve got in this little gap and hopefully for Misano we can have another step forward.” Markus Reiterberger: “Unfortunately, the changes we made today for the Superpole race and the main race did not help as much as we had hoped. I had a great start in the second race and felt super on the bike in the opening laps. I was easily able to match the pace of the front-runners. However, I then started to lose grip on the rear wheel and it was tough to hang on to twelfth place. The result is obviously not what we wanted. However, we made a few findings again and gathered some information. We will continue to work hard and I am now looking forward to Misano. Before then, I will attempt to find out how I can possibly change my riding style and we will analyse the data to see what we can do to the bike.” \n"}

We know that we can only improve gradually, but that is what we are doing. We are confident that it is only a matter of time before we enjoy some even better race results. Tom once again did a good job of exploiting the potential of the RR. Markus also made good progress today after a difficult Friday. Our goal for tomorrow is to continue to improve and for both riders to finish higher than they did today.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a very productive day for Markus. We introduced quite a major change for him overnight and he adapted very well to that, so I am very pleased for him. He took that into the race. It was almost a race of experience, to understand the set-up we had just given him and he did pretty well with his lap times coming down towards the end of the race. Of course, the top ten would have been nice but eleventh was also a good finish today. Tom on the other hand had a good Superpole. We got on the front two rows of the grid which was positive. He got a good start but got pushed back then. He literally circled all race in that position and then inherited one place in the end. He had a slight vibration issue from the chassis which we can fix overnight. We collected more valuable data for tomorrow. We hope for a strong sprint race and try to secure a place on the front row of the grid. The target for tomorrow’s main race is to improve on today’s overall position and try to move up the order a little bit further.” Tom Sykes: “I’m relatively happy to be honest. I made a pretty good start to the race and again we just had some small issues that we had seen in some other races before, while I was able to do some pretty nice things with the BMW S 1000 RR in the middle of the corner. I’m at the back of the guys but then I find some limitations. On a clear track, we have a better rhythm but I’m still enjoying the riding – I would just like a bit more from my results. But like I said, in terms of that, this is only round six and I don’t feel we are doing a bad job, especially considering how new the project is. I’m upbeat and my target is to keep working and moving forward, especially considering what should still be to come in terms of development. We just need time and everybody in the project understands that. We’re all enjoying ourselves and working to the same target and I believe we’ll get there. For now, we can’t do magical things and I think everybody in the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is doing an extraordinary job. We’ll keep on pushing.” Markus Reiterberger: “I’m really happy. Yesterday was a pretty complicated day for all of us and my team worked really hard and gave me a completely different bike today. I am really grateful to them. It seemed that we improved in some areas. The goal was to be within the top ten, which we narrowly missed, but we made some progress. That is the most important thing and I hope that we can take another step tomorrow. We have to work in the area that I’m still losing the front a bit and if we manage to bring the bike out of the corner a little bit better I think I can find a few tenths per lap.” \n"}

This proved to be a clever tactical move, which really paid dividends after a safety car period. Once the other drivers had all been in for their mandatory tyre change, Wittmann found himself leading the race on lap 17. He controlled the race from that point to take victory. Wittmann’s success was also the 35thDTM win for BMW since the brand returned to the series in 2012, and the 25thvictory for the BMW M4 DTM.In total, five BMW M4 DTMs finished in the top ten. Bruno Spengler (CAN) was fourth in the BMW Bank M4 DTM. Philipp Eng (AUT, ZF BMW M4 DTM) also finished in the points in seventh place. DTM rookie Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), after starting the race as the best-placed BMW driver after qualifying as he did in the Sunday race at Zolder (BEL), came home ninth. Timo Glock (GER, JiVS BMW M4 DTM) ended race one at Misano in tenth place. Joel Eriksson’s (SWE) race came to a premature end after just two laps following a technical issue with the CATL BMW M4 DTM.Reactions to the fifth DTM race of the 2019 season at Misano.Rudolf Dittrich (General Manager BMW Motorsport Vehicle Development): “We saw another entertaining and nerve-racking DTM race today, with plenty of battles right through to the finish. Unfortunately, we were not right up there at the front in qualifying this time. As such, we knew we would be in for a tough race. That makes me all the happier with the fantastic victory for Marco Wittmann and BMW Team RMG. Marco had to start the race from 18thafter technical issues in qualifying. We took a big strategic risk with his early stop, however, Marco paced the tyres superbly. He really looked after his tyres well today. It was another extraordinary performance from Mega Marco and his team. I’d also like to congratulate Bruno Spengler on his impressive fourth place. He actually deserved to finish on the podium. Philipp Eng, who came into the race as the championship leader, unfortunately got caught up in a bunch at the re-start and consequently lost a lot of positions. Like Timo Glock, he found himself stuck in the middle of the pack. Sheldon van der Linde showed his pace again as the best-placed BMW driver after qualifying, and was involved in a lot of battles for position. He gained a lot of experience again in this race. Unfortunately, Joel Eriksson’s race was over too soon as a result of a technical issue. That is a shame, as he would have been looking at finishing in the points. We were delighted by the guest appearance by Andrea Dovizioso. We are looking forward to seeing him on four wheels again tomorrow.”Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“It is a fantastic feeling. We did not have luck on our side at the last race weekend, but managed to regroup successfully. Marco Wittmann’s drive today was worthy of a champion, and the guys in the garage worked hard to get the car up and running again in time for the start. That did not look likely this morning. Bruno Spengler also achieved a superb result. The performance is definitely there for Bruno, and we know there is more to come. We are very happy to have him in our team, and that he feels at home here. Timo Glock also picked up a point – they all count.”Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 18th, Race: 1st, Drivers’ standings: 2nd, 68 points):“I am really happy. What a fantastic race. Particularly after the misfortune in both races in Zolder – Lady Luck was on our side again today. I was obviously very disappointed not to have set a lap time in qualifying. We had to take a huge risk, as I started the race from last place. We stopped early, without knowing for certain whether we could complete the full race on just one set of tyres. The final five or six laps were obviously critical, but it worked out in the end and we won the race. That is fantastic, particularly for my team, who had to pull out all the stops to get the car ready for the race after qualifying. I’d like to thank my team: That was simply superb!”Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 6th, Race: 4th, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 36 points):“Congratulations to the team and Marco Wittmann. It was a perfect strategy and he drove very well. Unfortunately, we were a little unlucky. We had the speed to finish on the podium. The last few races have been slightly different. You have had to take your chance with the safety car and have a little luck on your side. We were lacking that a little. However, the car was good and I had a superb start and a good pit stop. I’d like to thank my team for that. I’m looking forward to tomorrow.”Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 10th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 21 points):“It was a difficult and, above all, a crazy race, with Marco Wittmann taking the win. It showed again that, if you start from the back of the grid, you should stop on the opening lap to give yourself a chance of winning the race. As far as my race is concerned, I was out there driving, but the balance of the car was not as I would have liked it to be. Unfortunately, I cannot really tell you why that was yet.”Bart Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“That was the fifth safety car in the fifth race. This time, Marco Wittmann benefitted from it. At the same time, he drove an impressive race. As such, I would first like to congratulate him, BMW Team RMG and BMW. We ended the race with two cars in the points, with Philipp Eng in seventh and Sheldon van der Linde in ninth. Having started from fifth and seventh, we were obviously hoping for a little more than that. For that reason, we must continue to work hard and cope as well as possible with the hot conditions. In the case of Joel Eriksson, we unfortunately had a technical issue. We will have to take a look at it and determine what we can do for tomorrow to take another step forward and come back stronger.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 7th, Race: 7th, Drivers’ standings: 3rd, 65 points):“Seventh place is obviously not a dream result. However, if you want to challenge for the championship in the DTM, it is very important to pick up points on days like today. I did not put together a really quick lap in qualifying, and failed once or twice to manoeuvre my way into a good position at the re-start. However, the team helped me back up the field with a good strategy. On the whole, I am happy to finish in the points. Congratulations to Marco Wittmann on a fantastic fightback and victory.”Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 5th, Race: 9th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 23 points):“It all started really well, qualifying as the best BMW driver. I tried to challenge for the lead at the start of the race. Maybe I damaged my tyres in the process. I am disappointed with the result, as it could definitely have been better. However, I am learning all the time. I will now turn all my attention to tomorrow.”Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 12th, Race: DNF, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 20 points):“We got off to a good start and the first couple of laps went pretty well. However, we then suffered technical issues quite quickly and were forced to retire from the race. Nonetheless, we will now focus on tomorrow and do our very best. We definitely have the speed.”\n"}

Hickman won the race and set the fastest lap. The Superbike TT was overshadowed by the fatal accident of BMW road racer Daley Mathison (GBR) of Team Penz13.com. The second race in the 1000 cc category in the Superstock TT followed on Thursday. Hickman dominated the race on his BMW S 1000 RR right from the start. After three laps on the ‘Mountain Course’, he crossed the finish line as the winner, with a lead of 26 seconds over his closest rival. Race week drew to a close on Friday with the Senior TT over six laps. Hickman stormed away from the field on his RR and extended his lead to almost 18 seconds. However, an overheating issue forced him to reduce his speed – but Hickman had no intention of quitting the race, and ended up on the podium in second place. Michael Dunlop (GBR), who once again joined forces with the Tyco BMW team at the Isle of Man TT, was also involved in the battle for the podium on his RR.

At Jerez de la Frontera, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team gained initial experience with the new RR in January, during one of the first winter tests of the fledgling project. Quotes ahead of the races at Jerez de la Frontera. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We already gathered data at the winter test at Jerez de la Frontera, which we are now able to use for tuning the two BMW S 1000 RRs for the race weekend in the same place. We were also able to work through a few areas last week during the test at Misano. We are making continuous progress with the new RR, and this is reflected in the performance on the track. Our objective for the debut season is to move towards the top step by step, and we’ve done well with this in the race events so far. Now we are looking forward to Jerez de la Frontera and will give it our all to be up there battling for the top positions.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Following on from a successful test at Misano last week, both Tom and Markus have got a good and positive feeling to take to Jerez this weekend. Markus for sure has made a step forward with his feeling and balance of the bike and we hope that we can transfer this into Jerez. He’s had a good history in Jerez at the past so I feel it could be a positive circuit for him. Equally Tom came away from the test with a good feeling too. A lot of parts were tested, even though we had some changeable weather. But overall, both riders and the team are feeling confident for Jerez. We feel that we can certainly challenge for the top six positions over the course of the weekend and the weather looks very promising, too, so that will be good for some consistency. So overall, we’re in a good, strong position.” Tom Sykes: “I am very much looking forward to going to Jerez. We showed some potential there in the winter test, even considering the basic nature of where our package was back then. It was fresh out of the crate and certainly a long way from where we are now. So, given the fact that we already showed our potential back then and also off the back of the successful two-day test last week at Misano, I’m really optimistic. I think the track layout can be beneficial for the BMW S 1000 RR and I would certainly like to be in a similar position to where we were at Imola. So obviously my target for Jerez is to be at the front or close to it and to keep moving the whole of the project forward together with the guys.” Markus Reiterberger: “I am looking forward to going to Spain. Hopefully warm Spanish weather will await us. The track is nice and fluid, and I think that it should suit me. A lot of changes have been made to the asphalt there in recent years and I hope that the conditions there will be good. When we did tests there in winter, our BMW S 1000 RR was brand new. Meanwhile, we have made major developments to the bike and I am excited to see how it will perform there. We made further progress at the Misano test last week. I am feeling confident and will make sure that I am well prepared when I arrive at Jerez. Thanks to the team for the support, and now it’s time to attack once again.” \n"}

His emotions in the cockpit after crossing the finish line were quite clear. With his first DTM victory in Saturday’s race at Zolder (BEL), a dream came true for BMW works driver Philipp Eng (AUT). On Sunday, the 29-year-old Austrian, who is contesting his second DTM season with BMW Team RBM, finished on the podium again in second place, which saw him take the lead in the DTM driver’s standings. Eng started his career in motorsport in Formula BMW and, after several years in other race series and cars, returned to BMW in 2016. In his very first year as a BMW works driver, he celebrated victory at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL) in the BMW M6 GT3. In 2017, he battled for the title in the ADAC GT Masters with BMW Team Schnitzer right down to the last day of the season. Eng was added to BMW’s DTM squad in 2018. In only his third DTM race, he celebrated his first podium at the Lausitzring (GER); one day later he brought home his first pole position at the same track. One race weekend later, Eng followed up with his second podium in Budapest (HUN). In addition to his involvement in the BMW DTM team, Eng still contests GT races. 2018 saw him take part in the legendary 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) in the BMW M8 GTE of BMW Team MTEK – and celebrate his second overall win at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps in the BMW M6 GT3 of Walkenhorst Motorsport. 2019 started off with another victory for Eng. With his team-mates Augusto Farfus (BRA), Connor De Philippi (USA) and Colton Herta (USA), he drove to victory in the GTLM class at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), in the BMW Team RLL BMW M8 GTE. And in the DTM, Eng set a new lap record for closed vehicles in his ZF BMW M4 DTM at the opening weekend at Hockenheim (GER) – when he secured pole position on Sunday. This was followed by the successful weekend at Zolder. Philipp, you celebrated your first DTM win at Zolder. What was going through your mind as you crossed the finish line? Philipp Eng: “I just screamed. A great weight has been lifted from my shoulders. I have wanted to get a DTM win ever since I started racing. And for me personally, it has taken a great weight off my mind. Not because anybody was pressuring me, just because I really, really wanted it. It was such a cool feeling. And everyone was really happy for me – it was great to see.” You talked at length about Charly Lamm after this win. What did he mean to you? Eng: “A great deal. Charly was a good friend and a very important companion. He was just an incredibly great person. I learned a great deal in the year that I drove for him in the ADAC GT Masters. And not only about motorsport. He always said: ‘You have to be in the right frame of mind.’ That was always our running gag, but it was much more than that. We had a very special, close connection. It was a great loss, and at Zolder I felt him sitting on the passenger seat next to me and keeping his fingers crossed for me.” In your second DTM year you are now a DTM winner and are currently top of the driver’s championship. But it was far from easy getting to this point. Did you have to overcome a hurdle or two during your career to get where you are now? Eng: “It all started because I watched karting on TV and I said to my parents that I would like to try it. They made my wish come true and I went to the karting school near Salzburg almost every Tuesday. It was so much fun. So I got really involved in karting and did really well internationally. After my 2004 win at the Italian Open Masters, Red Bull added me to their Junior team. That is what enabled me to get involved in single-seater racing. Without this support I would never have sat in a racing car because my parents are just regular people. They always did everything in their power for me, but it was clear from the start that they wouldn’t sell the shirt off their back. It was a difficult time for me when I lost the Red Bull drive. I just wasn’t good enough at that point. I totally understood the decision, because at that time I wasn’t what they were looking for. But naturally it was difficult to find a budget again after that.” How did things progress for you from there? Eng: “Peter Mücke helped us a great deal at that time, and I was able to keep racing in Formula BMW. I finished third in the overall standings and won the Formula BMW World Final. The reward was driving the Formula 1 car in Mexico City, and I will never forget that day. Plans to race in Formula 3 after that came to nothing, so I competed in Formula BMW for Peter Mücke again. He was an important guide on my journey. Then I raced in Formula 2 in 2009 and 2010, but the financial situation there was strained at times as well. My parents pitched in once again, and different people helped me here and there. 2010 really was a character building year because I would travel to the races and sometimes I wouldn’t know on Thursday if I would be able to race on the Friday. So it became clear that Formula 1 wasn’t going to happen. I was already 21 back then. And from that point on, I really wanted to make it to the DTM; that was my major goal. Initially, I competed in various Porsche one-make cups and the GT Masters – and then I became a BMW works driver.” Was being signed as a BMW works driver the breakthrough in your career? Eng: “Definitely. I was successful in the one-make cups in 2014 and 2015, but the big breakthrough was very clearly signing my works contract. I always wanted to drive for BMW, partly because I had been a BMW Junior. So, I took my first steps with BMW Motorsport, and that everything has come full circle, culminating in the DTM win, is super cool. And I hope that there is even more to come.” What did you learn in your first year in the DTM that you can put into practice now? Eng: “A great deal. A large part of that was getting to know all the processes and procedures at a DTM weekend. Crucial for the current success is that I know to do this and that at this point and that point. Particularly when it comes to working with my engineer. That we always communicate well and always find the right time to take a step forward. It was difficult at the very beginning because I learned that at a DTM race weekend a great deal is about organising yourself so I had to get used to that first. It all gives you a routine and self-confidence. And I think that is a great difference this year compared with last year.” How are you working on yourself to become an even better driver? Eng: “I am extremely motivated to continuously improve myself. I spend a lot of time with the team, I spend a lot of time in the simulator, I’m on my bike a lot, or outside in the mountains. I want to get better every day and keep learning something new. Hopefully that will end up making me another half a tenth of a second faster.” What is your strategy for when things don’t go according to plan? Eng: “I always ask myself the question: Can I influence this – yes or no? If, for example, like at the start of the race weekend at Hockenheim, there is a problem with the car, I can’t influence that at all. Then I simply trust my engineers and mechanics. That’s all I can do in that situation – as well as creating a positive atmosphere of course. When it comes to me: These days, I am much more chilled when I fail. It comes with success and with experience of how to handle failure. Fortunately, it doesn’t happen all that often, but I have a good method for getting out of it quickly. After all, there isn’t usually much time between two races. So it doesn’t do any good if you spend three days burying your head in the sand. Rather, after you have left the racetrack, you need to shrug it off and say to yourself: Things turned out that way and next time things will be better again. I always try to remain very positive.” In January it was the class win at Daytona, now your first DTM win and leading the championship, on top of this, iconic races such as Le Mans and the 24 Hours Nürburgring are planned in addition to the DTM. Has this been the perfect year for you so far? Eng: “It’s not only the results that have made this year an absolute dream. I’m contesting the DTM and am in action in the main events in the GT works commitments – that alone is fantastic. The fact that we started the year with the class win at Daytona was incredibly cool. I hope that the story isn’t over yet. We still have two very important 24-hour races in direct succession, but first things first, we are focussed on Misano.” What is your objective for Misano and the rest of the season? Eng: “I think that in the DTM, you just need to try to be consistently up there at the front and consistently picking up points. You don’t necessarily have to win every race, you just need to always be in the top four or top five. It is also important to pick up points in qualifying. That is my primary objective.” How do you achieve it? Eng: “By keeping on doing what we have been doing, and not trying to reinvent the wheel, rather focussing on the basics, which is good preparation and a simple, but confident approach to the races.” \n"}

The team used the Wednesday and Thursday test to evaluate new components for the BMW S 1000 RR Superbikes of riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Markus Reiterberger (GER). BMW Motorrad Motorsport took further development updates in the software and chassis areas to Misano, including a new triple clamp. Despite the weather not being ideal, with rain limiting track time, the team made further progress. In addition, the rain enabled the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team to gather important information in wet conditions. Next week, the team will travel to Jerez de la Frontera, where round six will be held from 7th to 9th June. Quotes after the Misano test. Tom Sykes: “Certainly, the entire BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has done a good job. We had quite a lot of fundamental items to get through. The weather gave us some limitations in track time but I feel we had a very structured plan considering. We’ve worked through various things and gained a lot of valuable information that we can use to move forward. I was ultimately happy with the information and what it gives us in terms of feeling with the BMW S 1000 RR on this track. Certainly, the mixed conditions and the kind of lack of surface grip gave us the chance to test different parameters of the bike. So overall I think it has been a successful test and an important one at this point of the season considering it’s a new project so we will see now how we will line-up going into the next race.” Markus Reiterberger: “Wednesday was a very interesting day for us as it was our first day with the new BMW S 1000 RR in fully wet conditions. I actually enjoyed that a lot. I had a lot of fun racing the bike in the rain. We made a big step forward in the electronics area that enabled me to do really fast lap times in the wet. It was very important for us to get an understanding for how to set up the bike for these conditions. In dry conditions, we still have some work to do but we’ve made another step in the right direction. We tested some different settings and some new parts. Overall, I’m happy with the test, we will now continue to work hard and give our best.” \n"}

Noiseless, emissions-free but very powerful: the MINI Electric will soon enrich the experience of locally emissions-free mobility with the addition of unique driving fun and the individual flair that is so typical of the British premium brand. The recent “testing programme” for the first purely electrically powered MINI was equally unconventional: on a foray to Frankfurt airport, a close-to-series prototype of the new model demonstrated just what electromobility in the style of MINI is capable of setting in motion. The MINI Cooper SE slipped straight into the role of an aircraft tug, setting off to the loading point towing a Boeing 777F freight aircraft with an unladen weight of some 150 tons. The unusual hook-up was filmed in a video clip. Created collaboratively by the BMW Group and Lufthansa Cargo, the 45-second commercial shows the MINI Cooper SE as a “muscle car” pulling the significantly larger and heavier transport aircraft across the airfield. The clip marks the start of a number of social media videos portraying the MINI Cooper SE in an exciting and entertaining manner. The videos, which will be published in the lead up to its market introduction, will link various topics of the BMW Group to be brought together.”The MINI Cooper SE will go into serial production at the British plant in Oxford as of November 2019. It is based on the MINI 3 door and combines locally emissions-free driving with the brand's characteristic go-kart feeling, premium quality and expressive design. As such, the MINI Electric offers a new type of sustainable mobility defined by driving fun and individuality, reflecting consistent implementation of the BMW Group’s electrification strategy. After the BMW i3 it is the second purely electrically powered model within the company’s premium automobile portfolio. Having been the epitome of thrilling mobility in the urban environment for 60 years, the MINI brand will in future combine locally emissions-free driving in city traffic with a unique emotional experience. In this way, the MINI Electric will be a driving force for future drive technology. Helping the MINI Cooper SE perform its muscle car role, the performance characteristics of the electric motor combine spontaneous power delivery with a high level of torque available directly from standing. The ongoing expansion of the range of vehicles with electrified drive across its various brands and segments is one of the key areas via which the BMW Group is shaping the mobility of the future based on its corporate strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT.With its spectacular show of strength at Frankfurt airport, the MINI Cooper SE prototype hooked up with an aircraft that already had an important role to play in the presentation of innovative BMW Group vehicle and technology concepts several months ago. Last September, the long-haul transport aircraft provided the setting for a rather special vehicle showcase – namely that of the BMW Vision iNEXT World Flight. Over a period of five days, media representatives were given the opportunity to view the BMW Group’s latest vision vehicle at the five venues in Munich, New York, San Francisco and Peking. In preparation for this, Lufthansa Cargo and BMW Group trade fair construction specialists converted the most efficient freight aircraft of its class into an exclusive, airworthy presentation platform for the BMW Vision iNEXT. This vision vehicle stands as a symbol for the BMW Group’s pool of future technologies and innovations that is used for all the company’s brands. The serial production vehicle model based on the vision model will be produced at the BMW Group plant in Dingolfing from 2021 onwards as the latest BMW Group technology flagship, featuring numerous innovations from the future-oriented areas of D-ACES (Design – Automated Driving, Connectivity, Electrification and Services). \n"}

The vision vehicle is a harmonious balance between futuristic technology and modern living space. Providing revealing answers to the question: “What does a vehicle look like that no longer needs to be driven by a person but can be if desired?” The combination of completely novel interior design using shy-tech and autonomous driving, inspired Daan Roosegaarde to translate its core messages – interior design, interaction and connectivity between humans, vehicles and their surroundings in order to flawlessly navigate in cities – into “SYNC”.“When I was a boy I never stayed inside, I always went outside. Playing in nature of the Netherlands, I was so used to personalizing and customizing the world around me; building tree-huts, looking at the flow of wandering ants, exploring new worlds” said artist Daan Roosegaarde. “For me this is the essence of design; to create landscapes to which you feel connected, with your mind, your body, with each other.”“SYNC” is a combination of a flexible membrane, light and music. The soundscape was specially composed by the duo Tale Of Us (Carmine Conte and Matteo Milleri). By stepping into the immersive installation each visitor creates through his physical presence a unique space shown by changing light. The more people experience the space, the more different it connects and transforms into a collective moment.“Collaborations with designers and artists are a very valuable source of inspiration for me and my team. The creative exchange with Daan Roosegaarde and his approach encouraged us to research and experiment new forms of interaction. SYNC is an emotional approach to the integration of high tech, which we have called ‘Shy-Tech’ in our BMW Vision iNEXT.” Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design, about Studio Roosegaarde’s creative approach of transforming human-centred design into an art installation. “SYNC” not only demonstrates the individual impact on space; its goal is to illustrate how essential human interaction is for our sustainable future. The starting line for the design collaboration between Studio Roosegaarde and the BMW i Design team were inspiring dialogues about the opportunities and challenges of autonomous driving.

António narrowly missed out on the top three, however, he did score some valuable points again in fourth place. After ten of the season’s 13 races, he is still in the thick of the race for the drivers’ title. Alexander reacted well to his grid penalty with an impressive and battling performance.

The BMW Group is taking the occasion of this year’s Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este to unveil the recreation of the BMW Garmisch, a classic concept car that was designed by Marcello Gandini for Bertone and vanished after its debut at the Geneva Motor Show in 1970. With the newly created car, BMW pays respect to one of Italy’s most influential car designers and adds an exciting chapter to the company’s history. “Marcello Gandini to me is one of the grandmasters of car design and his cars always have been an important source of inspiration for my work”, says Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President of BMW Group Design, who has been intrigued by the BMW Garmisch since he first discovered a faded period picture of the car some years ago. “Building the BMW Garmisch for a second time gave us the opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Gandini, recall one of his lesser-known cars and highlight Bertone’s stylistic influence on the evolution of BMW design. For me, that alone was reason enough to do this project – filling in the gaps and completing BMW’s history.” Since the early days of the brand, BMW has been inspired and influenced by Italian design and coachbuilding culture. From the lightweight aluminium BMW 328 Mille Miglia created at Carrozzeria Touring in the late 1930s to the wedge-shaped BMW M1 designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, there has always been a vital exchange of concepts and ideas across the Alps. And just like many other Italian show cars of the 1960s and 1970s, the original BMW Garmisch was developed by Bertone as an independent design proposal intended to demonstrate the studio’s creativity. “The original idea came from Nuccio Bertone himself who wanted to consolidate our existing relationship with BMW by designing a surprise show car for the Geneva Motor Show”, remembers Marcello Gandini, who was in charge of Bertone’s design department at the time. “We wanted to create a modern mid-sized coupe that was faithful to BMW’s design language, but that was also more dynamic and even a bit provocative.” While the side profile of the car was very sleek and clean, the most distinctive design feature of the BMW Garmisch was its bold, vertical and almost angular variation of BMW’s kidney-shaped radiator grill, which was flanked by square glass-covered headlights. Other unusual details included sports car-like louvres on the C-pillars and the honeycomb-patterned mesh cover for the rear window – a trademark element of Marcello Gandini’s style. Although the car was created in just a couple of months, the design team did not let the opportunity pass to give the interior their special treatment as well. With its rather unusual vertical radio on the center console, a lavish fold-out mirror for the passenger and a flamboyant mix of colours and materials, the BMW Garmisch added an elegant Piemontese twist to the rather functional interior design habits of the time. According to Marcello Gandini, even the car’s name was chosen to impress: “We picked the name Garmisch because skiing was very popular in Italy at that time. It evoked dreams of winter sports and alpine elegance.” Being faithful to the original car, the new BMW Garmisch is also a stunning showcase of BMW’s expertise in design research and prototype building. As original documents of the BMW Garmisch were sparse, the interdisciplinary team convoked from the BMW Group Design and BMW Classic departments had to retrace every detail of the car’s exterior and interior from a small selection of period images, most of them only available in black and white. Marcello Gandini himself contributed to the research process with memories from the creation of the car, allowing the design team to refabricate key details such as the exterior colour – a light champagne metallic in line with Italian fashion trends of the time – and the interior materials and trim. And while the BMW Design team used the latest 3D modeling technologies to revive and specify the original structures and shapes, the BMW Garmisch was coach-built by skilled craftsmen in Turin – just like the original car almost 50 years ago. “When I first heard that BMW wanted to recreate the BMW Garmisch, I was a bit surprised”, Marcello Gandini recalls of his first meeting with Adrian van Hooydonk, who visited him in Turin in the summer of 2018 to ask for the his approval. “Now I am very pleased that I was able to be part of this project and happy that BMW chose to recall this enjoyable past. Having seen the final car, it is hard for me to even distinguish it from the original.” With its clean, reduced design language and precise use of lines and geometrical shapes, the BMW Garmisch is an archetype of the radical new style that was pioneered by Italian studios such as Bertone, Italdesign and Pininfarina in the late 1960s and early 1970s – and that is still an important reference point for car designers today. As an ambassador of avant-garde design thinking, the BMW Garmisch is also meant to inspire contemporary designers to keep on reimagining the shape of the automobile. “At the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este, we should reflect on the past, but we should also think about where we are going”, says Adrian van Hooydonk. “Marcello Gandini’s designs have always been very clear and very clean, but also very dramatic. This is why I find his work so inspiring. He was always able to create something spectacular using very few design elements. This approach of trying to accomplish a lot with less is quite modern still today.” -- Born in 1938, Marcello Gandini is one of the most influential car designers of the 20th century. During his 14 years as Design Director of the Bertone design studios in Turin, he created some of the most daring and revolutionary automobiles of the era, including wedge-shaped concept cars like the Lancia Stratos Zero or the Alfa Romeo Carabo as well as iconic sports cars like the Lamborghini Miura which are sought-after by collectors and celebrated at concours events worldwide. Besides the BMW Garmisch, Marcello Gandini and his team at Bertone have worked on the BMW Spicup showcar and the first generation of the BMW 5 series, which was created under the lead of BMW’s former head of design Paul Bracq.\n"}

Driven anti-clockwise.Corners5 left-handers and 5 right-handers. Slowest corner: T6 (approx. 48 km\/h). Fastest corner: T8 (approx. 160 km\/h).Track surfaceVery flat, same concrete surface throughout (airfield)Grip levelMedium. As the circuit is not on public streets and there are no leaves or pollen on the track, qualifying group 1 should not be at such a great disadvantage.Circuit layoutRelatively high average speed. As such, relatively high energy consumption. Two long straights and a wide track allow for good overtaking manoeuvres.Tyre wearHigh. Particularly on the right side. Tyre wear can be a key factor in the race.Attack ZoneATTACK MODE is activated on the outside of Turn 6. There is a risk of losing positions. Risk of crashesRelatively low, due to the wide track.Key factorsHigh efficiency of the drivetrain, energy management, tyre wear. Quotes ahead of the BMW i Berlin E-Prix: Jens Marquardt (BMW Group Motorsport Director):“The first home race for BMW i Andretti Motorsport this weekend is something very special for us. As ‘Official Vehicle Partner’, BMW i has been closely associated with Formula E from Season 1. BMW i has also been title partner of the BMW i Berlin E-Prix since 2018. We now come to Tempelhof Airport as a racing team for the first time – and with our sights set firmly on converting the great potential of the BMW iFE.18 into good results. So far, we have done well in our debut season and, despite a few highs and lows, we are still in the thick of the race for the Drivers’ title with António Félix da Costa. The whole team is determined to put on a good show for the German fans in Berlin.”Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18):“The home race for our team and BMW is another new circuit for me. I have prepared well in the simulator and have the impression that the track is far more spacious than the typical, narrow street circuits we often drive on in Formula E. Overtaking seems to be possible, which will make the racing more interesting, particularly for the fans. The unusual race format, with the practice sessions on Friday and then straight into qualifying on the Saturday, represents a new challenge. However, I am really looking forward to it.”António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18):“I am really looking forward to the home race for BMW i Andretti Motorsport in Berlin. Our package is very good and I believe we should do well on the circuit at Tempelhof Airport. Unfortunately, we have not had the results we hoped for recently, but I am still in the race for the Drivers’ title. Hopefully we can bounce back strongly in Berlin and score some important points.”The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the race.

The BMW Group establishes its motorsport programme for the future with a clear focus. The foundation is the BMW Group strategy NUMBER ONE > NEXT. With this strategy, the BMW Group is taking account of the transition in the automobile industry. Motorsport remains an integral part of BMW’s DNA and continues the resolute forward-looking orientation in just the same way as the company. By moving into new future fields and having a sharper focus, BMW Group Motorsport is contributing to the corporate strategy, taking the current economic conditions into account.The range of activities in BMW i Motorsport and BMW M Motorsport will remain broad in the future. With its involvement in the ABB FIA Formula E Championship, BMW demonstrates its electrification expertise and its claim as technological leader with the BMW i brand. On the other hand, the dynamics and the performance of BMW M cars remain paramount in the DTM and in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. As part of having a focus, BMW will bid farewell to the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) at the end of the current ‘Super Season’. In customer racing, a new flagship for the GT3 category is in the works. As an additional future-oriented field, BMW will increase its involvement in sim racing, which is recognised as an independent motorsport discipline and attracts new young target groups. In addition, the collaboration between BMW Motorrad Motorsport and BMW Group Motorsport will be further strengthened to use more synergies – especially regarding commercial and logistical aspects – between automobile and motorcycle racing. The aim of the future commitments is to make use of technological synergies within the development department. There will also be greater focus on existing and potential customers. The close relationship with BMW M will be clearly visible in production car racing, but beyond pure technology, customers will enjoy even greater benefits from the BMW Group’s motorsport commitment and get involved – whether on site or in new areas such as virtual sim racing.Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development, said: “Motorsport is and will remain firmly established in the genes of the BMW Group. We are using our commitment – next to the sporting competition – to demonstrate our performance and future ability as a company. The same developers that are driving forward electrification for BMW i are also working in Formula E. This ensures that BMW is also synonymous with driving pleasure in the field of electromobility. Through sim racing, we are reaching new, young target groups and giving our young drivers another platform, on which to compete. We are also demonstrating that BMW M stands for performance and high-performance motorsport on the racetracks of this world – for example, with Class 1, GTLM, GT3 and GT4. With this broad programme, despite a challenging environment, we are well positioned and are supporting the goals of our company strategy Number ONE Next.”Pieter Nota, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Customer, Brands, Sales, said: “Motorsport will remain of great significance for our brands BMW and BMW Motorrad in the future. However, this environment has become increasingly complex in recent years. With that in mind, we are very well positioned with our differentiation between BMW i Motorsport and BMW M Motorsport. This enables us to address our target groups even more specifically on the one hand, and to attain maximum widespread impact on the other hand. These are important evaluation criteria for our commitments.” The BMW Group Motorsport programme in detail.BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt talks about the details of the different modules of the strategy going forward. “Motorsport has always been an important pacesetter for the BMW Group, and a relevant testing ground for future development in the automobile industry as a whole – and that will remain the case.“Formula E has proved to be a fantastic platform for us to show our expertise in the area of electromobility, and to focus on other topics of the future. Our entry at the start of Season 5 was a resounding success, and we won at the first time of asking. Our involvement in this series is set for the long term. For us, Formula E is not simply a matter of motorsport, our involvement goes beyond that. For us, it is an important platform for demonstrating our expertise in the major fields of innovation in the automobile industry. What is important to us is that the cost-benefit ratio in Formula E remains positive, even with new competitors joining constantly.”“With the introduction of the new Class 1 regulation, the new turbo engine, a new manufacturer and important steps towards internationalisation, the DTM has embarked on a promising journey. Now it is important to keep going. We believe in the series and will fully support the DTM in further expanding its international presence.”“The IMSA series plays a central role for us in North America and is developing well. The USA is the most important market for BMW M cars, so it is very fitting to build a direct bridge to our production models there with the BMW M8 GTE.”“We will not compete in WEC going forward. Therefore, the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June will be another highlight for us in drawing to a close – just like in 2018, when we celebrated the successful world premiere of the BMW 8 Series Coupe there. But in light of us sharpening our focus as part of our strategy for the future, continuing our WEC involvement in the coming years does not fit with our direction. The global presence of BMW M Motorsport is safeguarded by customer racing and the DTM in Asia and Europe, as well as the IMSA series in North America, even without competing in a world championship. We would like to thank BMW Team MTEK for its dedication over recent years and we wish WEC all the best and hope that it makes good progress.”“As part of the BMW M Motorsport Customer Racing Programme, privateer drivers and teams will continue to represent the BMW brand around the world in the future. We will provide them with a wide range of support – and competitive vehicles of course. The BMW M4 GT4 has proved to be a real winner since its debut in the 2018 season and the BMW M6 GT3 continues to celebrate regular victories all over the world. A successor for our successful GT3 model is already in the works. This means that works-supported starts in iconic international GT races such as at the Nordschleife, at Spa-Francorchamps or in Macau will still be possible.”“It is great to see how many touch points there already are between the BMW Motorrad Motorsport programme and us at BMW Motorsport. We want to make these synergies even more intense under the umbrella of BMW M Motorsport in the coming years. The WorldSBK is the ideal stage for the BMW S 1000 RR, with which the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team represents the BMW colours.”“Sim racing is an exciting future-oriented field for us – and is now an officially recognised motorsport discipline. We have the utmost respect for the competitors in these virtual races and want to make them even stronger with our experience and technologies. To that end, we will draw up a programme that is linked to our BMW Motorsport Junior Programme and raises it to a new level.”\n"}

He has now taken the lead in the drivers’ standings, with 59 points. In the fourth DTM race of his career, Sheldon van der Linde (RSA, Shell BMW M4 DTM) entered the history books as the youngest BMW driver of all time to claim a pole position. The DTM newcomer finished the race in fifth place.In third place for some time, van der Linde appeared to be on course to reach the podium but dropped two places on the final lap. Bruno Spengler (CAN, BMW Bank M4 DTM) and Joel Eriksson (SWE, CATL BMW M4 DTM) also reached the top ten, finishing in seventh and tenth positions. Timo Glock (GER, JiVS BMW M4 DTM) was in the running but he was forced to retire just before the end of the race after a series of battles damaged his car. He was classified as finishing in 14th place. On lap 23, Marco Wittmann (GER, Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM) hit the rear of Robin Frijns’ (NED) Audi during a battle. Frijns had to retire and the BMW M4 GTS DTM safety car appeared on the track. Wittmann received a drive-through penalty and fell back to 13th place. Reactions to the fourth DTM race of the 2019 season at Zolder. Rudolf Dittrich (General Manager BMW Motorsport Vehicle Development):“After two race weekends in the 2019 DTM season, we can be very satisfied. We have reached pole position in all four races so far, we have won two races and recorded a total of four podiums. That clearly shows what a good job everyone involved did over the winter during development of the new car and the turbo engine. BMW Team RBM has enjoyed a fantastic home event at Zolder; after the win for Philipp Eng and the second place for Joel Eriksson on Saturday, we added pole position for Sheldon van der Linde and second place for Philipp Eng on Sunday. Congratulations to Bart Mampaey and his crew, and to Philipp for his sensational weekend. Congratulations are also in order for Sheldon, who has entered the history books as the youngest BMW driver to claim a pole position in just his fourth DTM race. It is a shame that he just missed out on his first podium in the race. After the two races in Belgium, we are now leading the drivers’ standings with Philipp. We are aiming to build on that at Misano in two weeks.” Bart Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“Third on the grid and second place for Philipp Eng in an exciting race are very good results. That also represents a big step forward in the championship. Regarding Sheldon van der Linde, it was a slightly disappointing finish as he had started from pole position and had defended his third place very well until just before the end. It was a big shame that he dropped two places just two turns from the end of the race. Nonetheless, he gave an outstanding performance to secure pole position, recorded another good points finish and kept pace with the experienced drivers. All in all, we are very pleased.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 3rd, Race: 2nd, Drivers’ standings: 1st, 59 points):“That was a very hard race today. Actually, it was one of the toughest in my career. After a good start, I made a mistake on turn two and drove straight on. I then had to battle for my position. The result shows that we have done a very good job in the first four races. I can only thank everyone at BMW Motorsport and my team for having such a reliable and fast car - in qualifying and in the race. We are happy to take the 19 points and the overall lead, even though it is nothing more than a snapshot.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 1st, Race: 5th, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 21 points):“I was in third place one lap from the end. Then I left the door open a bit in a battle with Jamie Green and Mike Rockefeller got past me as well so, I finished in fifth. Nonetheless, I am absolutely delighted with the qualifying result and my first pole position in the DTM.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 10th, Race: 10th, Drivers’ standings: 11th, 20 points):“The race did not go as we had expected. The second pit stop during the safety car period did not pay off. We tried out an alternative strategy but unfortunately, it didn't work out. Now it's time to concentrate fully on Misano.” Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“After a so-so qualifying session, we saw a very turbulent race today. We will have to calm down and take another look at it all. It was a difficult race in terms of strategy for all of us on the pit wall. We were very efficient and once again showed just how well our strategists work. However, we cannot be happy with the result as we could have achieved more today with the cars performing like they did. But of course we thank the entire team for their fantastic work once again.” Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 15th, Race: 7th, Drivers’ standings: 8th, 24 points):“It could have been worse. I was in the lead in yesterday's race but finished tenth thanks to some bad luck and a safety car period. Today, I started from 15th position and crossed the line in seventh place. The team's strategy was great. We took a lot of risks but it paid off. Thank you very much. The team did a monumental job. We scored some important points.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 7th, Race: 13th, Drivers’ standings: 3rd, 43 points):“We had good pace again but the accident with Robin Frijns resulted in a drive-through penalty that cost me the race. I was trying to get past him when he skidded sideways on turn one and came over to my racing line. I was lapping faster on fresh tyres and hit him, which spun him around. From my point of view, there was hardly anything I could have done to avoid it. Of course, that was a shame.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 5th, Race: 14th, Drivers’ standings: 12th, 20 points):“Qualifying and the first part of the race went well for me. Later on, I got stuck behind Robin Frijns and just concentrated on retaining my position. Unfortunately, I lost a bit of ground with the pit stop and dropped back behind Philipp Eng. During the restart after a safety car period the track got very crowded and unfortunately there was contact with Marco Wittmann. That damaged my car.”\n"}

The date was 11th March 1984. The newly founded “German Production Car Championship”, now the DTM, entered its maiden season at the “Circuit Zolder” to the east of Brussels (BEL). The very first DTM race was 24 laps, and a total of 102.288 kilometres - and ended with a BMW victory. After a dramatic race, Harald Grohs (GER) in the BMW 635 CSi was the first to cross the finish line and went down in motorsport history as the first ever DTM winner.And it was a top-four result for the Munich brand, since positions two to four were also taken by BMW drivers: Udo Schneider, Volker Strycek and Leopold Prince of Bavaria (all GER). In an interview, Grohs looks back at his historic win in the first DTM race, he remembers the initial phase of the touring car series and talks about the development of the DTM from back then to the new turbo era. Mr Grohs, you won the first DTM race back in 1984. What are your memories of this victory in Zolder? Harald Grohs: “I must say that I was jolly glad to bring home the win in the face of strong competition. But then the rude awakening came an hour and a half after the race: I was disqualified due to a technical insignificance. I was granted the win but denied the points for the championship standings. And unfortunately it was by exactly that number of points that I lost the overall win to Volker Strycek at the end of the season.” What does it mean to you to be the first race winner in the history of the DTM? Grohs: “A great deal, But I didn’t just celebrate that win in the DTM. I won every opening race with all four cars that BMW developed and built for various categories such as the DRM or DTM. That makes me proud and happy.” What was a DTM weekend like back then? Grohs: “We arrived on Friday, had a free practice session on Saturday morning and had a lot of time overall to take a really good look around the paddock. Then there was a qualifying session in the afternoon and we raced on Sunday. It was very relaxed. We also didn’t have a lot of media or much PR work to do. And you weren’t as under the microscope as you are today.” Describe your BMW 635 CSi from back then … Grohs: “That car was relatively easy to drive in both wet and dry conditions. However, driving it at the limit was a real challenge for us all due to the high steering forces and pedal forces of 90 kilos for the brake and 80 kilos for the clutch.” How do you feel about the new turbo era of the DTM? Grohs: “It is simply fantastic. I have to say that how the BMW guys drove in Hockenheim, even in adverse circumstances, and how cool Marco Wittmann brought home the first win of the new era really deserves respect.” When you look at the period from back then to today, how do you feel the DTM has developed overall? Grohs: “We had highs and lows in the DTM. Now and again in the 90s, the costs got out of hand because there were no fixed limits. I’m really happy that we have Gerhard Berger now, who unites everything a bit, makes things a bit more normal and freezes the technology slightly. But you can’t prevent technology from continually developing. When you think that the teams only have three of the new two-litre turbo engines available for two cars for the whole year, but the power trains still deliver more than 600 hp, it’s fantastic. Now I would just like to see one or two more manufacturers so it’s like the old days with 30 or 35 cars in the field.”\n"}

A feast for the eyes and ears will enchant fans of Historic Cars and Motorcycles at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este from 24th to 26th May 2019. This prestigious event is being held on the banks of Lake Como in Cernobbio, Northern Italy. The traditional press conference was held by the organisers on Wednesday 15th May to set the scene for the exclusive parade of beauties on two and four wheels. At Milan’s La Scala, BMW Group Classic, the Grand Hotel Villa d’Este and BMW Group Italia provided international media representatives with information about the programme schedule, the entire field of participants, and details and innovations that will once again make the world’s most exclusive beauty contest for classic vehicles with a heritage tradition an unforgettable event on the shoreline of Lake Como in 2019.At the press conference held in Milan’s La Scala, Ulrich Knieps, President of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este and Head of BMW Group Classic, joined with Danilo Zucchetti, Managing Director of Villa d’Este Hotels, and Sergio Solero, President of BMW Group Italia, to outline further details of the programme schedule. For the first time, they also presented all the vehicles nominated for the beauty contest in advance of the event. The list of nominated vehicles is available with immediate effect on the website of the Concorso D´Eleganza Villa D´Este.This year, the festival of elegance organised jointly by BMW Group Classic and the Grand Hotel Villa d’Este is being held under the motto “The Symphony of Engines – 90 Years of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este and BMW Automobiles”. In 1929, the beauty contest for automobiles celebrated its premiere in the grounds of the Grand Hotel Villa d’Este. At that time, the event had been created as a competition for particularly exclusive new vehicles.However, this was not the only premiere in that year. Meanwhile, the company BMW had already achieved initial successes as a manufacturer of aero-engines and motorcycles, and 90 years ago it started producing its first series automobile, the BMW 3\/15 3\/15 PS DA2. This anniversary provides the inspiration for this year’s BMW Group Classic exhibition at the “Padiglione Centrale” in the parkland of Villa Erba. A town setting from the 1920s forms the backdrop for presenting the historic automobiles and motorcycles that made the BMW Group mobile at that time. Yet another reason to celebrate is that the current event will mark an additional anniversary. For the past 20 years, the BMW Group has been committed to holding this beauty pageant for friends of classic vehicles. Initially, the BMW Group was the main sponsor but since 2005 it has staged the Concorso as joint organiser together with the Grand Hotel Villa d’Este. The contest has meanwhile become an absolute highlight for classic fans across the world.Once again in the anniversary year 2019, the contest for Historic Cars will comprise eight award classes. And a field of some 50 nominated vehicles will again reflect the entire fascinating bandwidth of automobile history. The Concorso di Motociclette is being held for the ninth time and has now become a fixed element of the event. The Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2019 will culminate with the award of the “Best of Show” among the Historic Cars on the Sunday.This year, for the first time, participants in the contest will gather to celebrate the launch of the weekend for classic vehicles to go on an outing together. On Thursday 23rd May 2019, the Villa d’Este Prelude Tour will take the automobiles that have been nominated for the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este on a trip through the picturesque landscape surrounding Cernobbio and the region around Lake Como. The Villa d’Este Prelude Tour will be presented by the new partner Pirelli. This year, the famous tyre manufacturer will also be represented as an exhibitor at the Villa Erba for the first time.The Trofeo BMW Group is traditionally conferred in the final podium ceremony for the winner of “Best of Show” and it celebrated another premiere at the press conference.In 1929, the winners of the eight award classes for Historic Cars and the winners of several special awards will be presented with trophies that have been completely redesigned. They are being produced in a supremely sophisticated, additive manufacturing process in a first-time experience. Know-how from different departments in the BMW Group has been bundled for the development and production of the new trophies.

BMW Motorsport provides a real highlight in their promotion of grass-roots level racing. The 2018 BMW Sports Trophy winners and VLN champions, Christopher Rink, Danny Brink and Philipp Leisen (all GER), are set for their race debuts at the wheel of the BMW M4 GT4. The trio, which won the Drivers’ title in last year’s VLN Endurance Championship Nürburgring (GER) in the BMW 325i, will drive the latest BMW Customer Racing car at the iconic Nürburgring 24 Hours in June. To prepare, the three drivers will also start in the 6-hour qualifying race on 19th May. The race outings in the BMW M4 GT4 are BMW Motorsport’s way of recognising the extraordinary performances that Rink, Brink and Leisen produced on the Nordschleife last season. The car will feature a special BMW M Motorsport livery with the letting ‘BMW Sports Trophy’ at the 24-hour race. BMW works driver Dirk Adorf (GER) will take his place in the cockpit as the fourth driver, and will comment live during his stints for TV station Nitro. Furthermore, with his vast wealth of experience on the Nordschleife and in the development of the BMW M4 GT4, Adorf will also serve as an important advisor for Rink, Brink and Leisen. “I am really pleased that, as well as the prize money and trophies, we are also able to present our BMW Sports Trophy winners with these extraordinary race outings in recognition of their impressive performances,” said BMW Group Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “Customer Racing is one of the central pillars of the BMW M Motorsport programme. It is the customer racing drivers who, with their success, do such an outstanding job of representing the BMW brand as ambassadors. We are very grateful for that. I will have my fingers crossed for Christopher Rink, Danny Brink and Philipp Leisen, and can hardly wait to see the BMW M4 GT4 race at the 24h race and follow the fascinating live commentary from Dirk Adorf in the cockpit.” A test at Portimão (POR) provided Rink, Brink and Leisen with the opportunity to gain their first experience at the wheel of the BMW M4 GT4. “The Portimão test was very important for us, because we were able to get a lot of laps in the BMW M4 GT4 under our belt, to familiarise ourselves with the car. The data analysis with the BMW Motorsport engineers was obviously also extremely valuable,” said Brink. Rink added: “The test at Portimão was super! I have also had the opportunity to drive the car on the Nordschleife once, in VLN1. It makes a very good impression there too. The driving experience is absolutely nothing like the production-based BMW 325i.” Leisen said: “The BMW M4 GT4 is a real racing car. I am excited to see how it feels on the Nordschleife. The qualifying race will be an important test for us, before it really counts in the 24-hour race.” Marcel Lenerz (GER) will contest the qualifying race as the fourth driver this Sunday, before Adorf will be in action at the iconic endurance race in June. “I have been involved in the development of the BMW M4 GT4 from the first test kilometres to its race outings, so I know the car very well. As such, I am obviously happy to offer advice to my three fellow drivers,” said Adorf. “In Christopher, Danny and Philipp we have the three VLN champions from 2018 on board. That means I don’t need to tell them anything when it comes to racing on the Nordschleife, as they already have plenty of experience.” Adorf primarily sees himself as the link between the racing action and the spectators. “I will be an expert, commentator and racing driver, so I can give the spectators an all-round package,” said Adorf. “I feel my main job is to bring the fans watching at home as close as possible to the fascination of the 24-hour race on the Nordschleife.” The BMW M4 GT4 race outings will be organised by Adrenalin Motorsport – the team with which Rink, Brink and Leisen achieved so much success in 2018. Team principal Matthias Unger and his crew won the BMW Sports Trophy Team Competition four times in a row between 2014 and 2017.\n"}

Back then, victory went to Harald Grohs (GER) in a BMW 635 CSi. The DTM last raced at Zolder in 2002. 17 years later, the touring car series now returns to the iconic circuit. BMW DTM driver Marco Wittmann (GER) tops the Drivers’ Championship going into the race weekend at Zolder. At the Hockenheim season-opener a fortnight ago, Wittmann took pole position and the race win on the Saturday. He then started the Sunday race from second place on the grid, before finishing eighth to pick up more valuable points. Wittmann has 34 points to his name after the first two races of the season. 22 DTM races have been held at Zolder since 1984. BMW drivers have been involved in 21 of those and have racked up nine victories and 24 podium finishes in total. The Zolder race weekend is the first home outing in the DTM for Belgian outfit BMW Team RBM. Quotes ahead of the DTM races at Zolder. Jens Marquardt (BMW Motorsport Director): “Zolder has an important place in the history of BMW Motorsport. Harald Grohs won the first DTM race ever there in 1984, at the wheel of the BMW 635 CSi. Many more successes were to follow between then and 1992. We are now looking forward to returning to this iconic racetrack with the new DTM. Bearing in mind the 2019 generation of cars, it is obviously a new circuit for everyone. We are very intrigued to see how the competition develops at Zolder. We had a very successful opener at Hockenheim, with two pole positions and one win. We want to back that up now in Belgium. The race weekend is particularly important for BMW Team RBM; the circuit is just an hour’s drive from the team headquarters.” Stefan Reinhold (Team Principal BMW Team RMG):“It is going to be an exciting weekend, as Zolder is a new venue for us in the DTM. Our first goal is to prepare as well as possible, and thus to lay the foundation for another good weekend. We must wait and see how we cope with the track. We do not have any experience there and the last time I was at Zolder was over 20 years ago. I have particularly fond memories of the circuit, as Zolder was the opening round of the race series in which I gained my first experience as a team principal at the end of the 1990s.” Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 16 points):“I don’t know the circuit at Zolder yet, but it is cool to go to a new track, at which I have never driven before. I am very excited to see what it is like there, and how we perform. We have seen that we have a good car, both in wet and dry conditions. We still need to work on being a bit stronger for the full race distance. On the whole, however, we have a good package in the new BMW M4 DTM and the team has done a superb job. It is still a little difficult to set any definite expectations for Zolder, as I don’t know the circuit. I’ll wait and see how it pans out and am looking forward to a new track.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Drivers’ standings: 1st, 34 points):“I do know Zolder, but it is 12 years since I raced there in Formula BMW. It is a very tight little circuit with few straights – not your typical DTM racetrack. I think qualifying will be extremely important, as overtaking could be tricky at Zolder. The kerbs in the chicanes will be a big issue – whether we should drive over them or are better off avoiding them in the DTM car. Friday’s first practice session is definitely going to be interesting. It is a new racetrack on the calendar, so we must try to adapt to it quickly and find a good rhythm from the word go. Then we can hope for a good second race weekend of the season.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 20 points):“I only know Zolder from what I have seen on TV and I am already very excited about what awaits us there, particularly as our car is still very new. As such, it will be a challenge to adapt to it in the short amount of track time we have at our disposal. I will look at more onboard footage and, together with the team, prepare as well as possible for Zolder. I am looking forward to a new racetrack and a new challenge.” Bart Mampaey (Team Principal BMW Team RBM):“I’m very happy that we have an event in Belgium. I think that it will be received very well, and the organisers at Zolder are working very hard to make it a successful event. Actually, I have to admit that I don’t have too much Zolder experience. The last time that our RBM team participated there was in 2010 in the FIA WTCC and we won a race. It will be interesting to race there now with the new turbo-powered BMW M4 DTM. Zolder is a slow track, yet we will go there with massive power and with a lot of straight-line speed, so braking will be very important. I hope that we keep on making progress as we did at Hockenheim. We need to carry the momentum from Sheldon’s P6 on Saturday and Philipp’s pole position and P4 on Sunday into the next event. We had a good season-opener and just need to continue working and try to carry on at Zolder.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Drivers’ standings: 8th, 15 points):“I raced at Zolder in the 2017 Blancpain GT Series with the BMW M6 GT3. The track is extremely technical. I really like it. The kerbs are very high and we must be careful not to damage the cars. It is certainly going to be an exciting weekend. I think overtaking could be possible, but a good performance in qualifying will be important again. I hope to be among the front-runners again, as I was on the Sunday at Hockenheim.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Drivers’ standings: 10th, 8 points):“Zolder is going to be a cool one. It’s obviously my first time there, and I am new to the DTM, so I’m going to have a lot to learn. However, I think we showed at Hockenheim that we can learn quite quickly so I’m looking forward to it. I’ve learned so much already in just the two races that I did at the season-opener and I want to build on that. I’m tenth in the championship, which I think is not bad at all. I will take that positive to Zolder.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Drivers’ standings: 14th, 1 point):“Actually I don’t really know what to expect from Zolder. I’ve never been there, but on the simulator the track looks like it should be fun to drive. My brother raced there two years ago and he told me that it’s a really cool track. We will go there, have a first look at the track and then take it from there.” Media Schedule (all times CEST). Friday, 17th May12.30-13.00, ITR press conference with Joel Eriksson and Bart Mampaey, Media Center Saturday, 18th May15.40-15.50, Mixed Zone with all BMW drivers, Media Center Sunday, 19th May15.40-15.50, Mixed Zone with all BMW drivers, Media Center \n"}

Sunday’s race day at Imola (ITA) was much shorter than planned for the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Tom Sykes (GBR) and Markus Reiterberger (GER) claimed eighth and tenth positions in the morning’s Superpole race. Race two in the afternoon had to be cancelled due to heavy rain. The track was already moist during morning warm-up. This was the very first session in rainy conditions with the new BMW S 1000 RR for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, as all previous tests and races had taken place in the dry. The weather conditions for the morning’s Superpole race were changeable, with dry spells. Sykes gave an impressive recovery performance: he had to start from the pit lane, in last place, due to his tyre pressure being slightly too low on the grid. Sykes ploughed through the field on his RR, moving up so far that he was able to cross the line in eighth position. Reiterberger ended the Superpole race in tenth place. A heavy downpour began just as the grid formed up for the second race. The start was delayed and then the race was finally cancelled an hour and a half later. Quotes after Sunday at Imola. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “After this weekend, we can draw the positive conclusion that our race pace is very good. However, yesterday's technical problems and Tom being demoted today meant that we weren't able to make the most of it. I understand the decision made by race control and the riders that it would have been too dangerous to start the race in the afternoon, although it would have been good for us to ride in the rain, as that would have helped us prepare for the future. Overall, we take a positive attitude from Imola as we head to the next race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The summary of the day is that we proved again that the BMW S 1000 RR is getting very quick now. We have a good pace and I was looking forward to a dry race. In the Superpole race, Tom unfortunately had to start from pit lane. He did the sighting lap to the grid on race tyres. Due to the low temperatures, the tyre pressure slightly dropped below the limit. We will adapt the procedures to avoid this in the future. Tom’s race then was very positive. With his lap times he could have been battling for fourth position which is a fantastic position to be in. Markus went with a different tyre scenario. He was one of only four riders to opt for the SCX tyre. It was a gamble and he would have been very, very good if that would have worked out but unfortunately he lost the tyre before the race was finished. But anyway, we are happy with the top ten for Markus. Overall we can say after this weekend that we are now showing that with its pace the bike can be fast now at many circuits. We can carry this forward and it’s also important that we will have a test at Misano before Jerez because we once again have many things to test.” Tom Sykes: “We just had a little bit of bad luck. The tyre pressure was finally correct but on the grid it was a little bit low because I made a slow lap to the grid. The BMW S 1000 RR chassis was working very well. I made obviously a lot of passes in ten laps. Sure, I’m a bit disappointed but we’re making progress all the time; the team works very hard and I am sure we will have some good fortunes soon. For now it has been a strange day, another race cancelled due to safety conditions, and now we are moving on to the next race where I hope the package can also be competitive. So keep working and hoping we will get the result we’re all working forward very soon.” Markus Reiterberger: “This morning's warm-up was the first time that we had raced in the rain with the new RR. I had a pretty good feeling. The conditions were changeable for the Superpole race. It was mainly dry, with some wet spots and we took the risk to opt for the Supersoft tyre. Unfortunately, tyre wear was quite heavy towards the end but I managed to cross the line in tenth place. We had to wait a long time to find out whether we would have a second race or not. It would have been important for us to gain some experience in the rain but the decision to cancel made sense from the point of view of rider safety, as it was really at the limit. Overall, we learned a lot at Imola and we will check out a lot of things during testing to help us continue to make progress. Thanks to the team for their hard work. We will all work hard together to reap the benefits of this work.” \n"}

He was excluded from the standings after the race because of a rule infringement. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport team principal):“This was caused by contact during the race between António and Mitch Evans. He then grabbed the steering wheel and accidentally switched to the higher power mode. He was unaware that he had done so and, as a team, we don't receive the telemetry, so it took a little while for us to realise what had happened. That meant that he drove using too much energy for a period of time and he has been punished for this rule infringement. This was an accidental infringement but the penalty was the logical decision. As a team, we're very disappointed with this outcome but we respect the decision made by race control.” Alexander Sims (GBR) performed well for an extensive duration in Monaco and looked to have secured a top ten place, before falling back to 15th position due to an incident shortly before the end of the race. Sims and Félix da Costa started the race from sixth and eighth positions and steered clear of all the early stage battles. Some tough duels took place on the track as the race progressed. Félix da Costa crossed the line in sixth place. A few laps before the end, Sims had a spin after a collision with Robin Frijns (NED, Envision Virgin Racing) which knocked him out of the top ten and he finished the race in 15th place. The BMW i FleetBMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 5.

However, the British rider was then forced to head for the pits. Reiterberger fell back to 13th place at the start and remained there for a while, before moving up again in the final phase to return to the top ten. Quotes after race one at Imola. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The day started off really well with Superpole qualifiying. Markus claimed seventh place and really showed that he had made a big leap forward from yesterday’s practice session. Tom made a great start to the race and being on his own in third place allowed him to exploit the RR’s potential. Unfortunately, an issue cropped up with the power management and Tom was unable to convert this performance into the result it deserved. We will now take a close look at what caused the problem. Markus lost a few places during the turmoil at the start and got stuck further back in the field. That made the race difficult for him, but he battled his way back and scored some important points by finishing tenth. Overall, we have seen that we have a good set up at Imola and we want to build on that tomorrow in the Superpole race and in the second race. According to the forecasts, the weather, however, could provide us with a new challenge.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “For Tom, it’s really sad. Five rounds into our first year in WorldSBK with this project and the new RR – and we were not only fighting for the podium, we were on the podium. Then a cruel small issue put an end to his race so I feel very, very sorry for Tom and everyone on his side of the garage because they work really hard. They’ve made a clever tyre choice that worked very well and he had a very good start and everything was there in front of him. We now must build on that and come back stronger. Markus unfortunately had a difficult race but again, we collected good data and hopefully starting from the same grid positions in tomorrow’s Superpole race we can see what we can do.” Markus Reiterberger: “I am really happy that we managed to improve on yesterday’s performance. We did a good job in Superpole to secure a starting position of seventh. It was a shame that I then lost a few places at the start and during the first few corners. I was stuck behind (Michael Ruben) Rinaldi for quite a while. I was faster, but I just couldn’t get past. However, I was able to overtake a few other riders towards the end and crossed the line in 10th place. That wasn’t quite the result we had hoped for but I am confident that I will continue to improve. We’ve still got a few issues to deal with at the moment but we will continue to work hard and I am very grateful to my team for that. Tomorrow is a new day that brings new opportunities and I hope that we can take another big step forward in the warm-up. Of course, we will have to keep an eye on the weather but I think that we can do a good job. We certainly have the potential to do that.” Tom Sykes: “To say I’m disappointed would be an understatement. We’ve worked so hard all weekend and we really improved some areas on the BMW S 1000 RR. We dug deep at the start and had a good position but then unfortunately had an issue with the bike. We had the pace today, we had a bit of luck with Chaz (Davies) not being in the race and we had a top-three position in our sight. We had a nice gap to the riders behind and I was just settling into a rhythm; the times were very consistent. It just seems we have a lot of bad luck at the moment so hopefully we’ll have a better day tomorrow.” \n"}

The curtain has been raised on the new safety car for the ABB FIA Formula E Championship: “Official Vehicle Partner” BMW i unveiled the new BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car at “Yacht Club de Monaco” on the eve of the Monaco E-Prix (MON). The car has been modified specifically for use at the racetrack and the design is based on its sister model, the BMW i8 Coupé Safety Car. Guests at the presentation included Pierre Casiraghi, vice president of “Yacht Club de Monaco”, Formula E Founder and CEO Alejandro Agag, and Dr. Robert Irlinger, Head of BMW i. The new BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car * is the latest addition to the fleet of BMW i Safety Cars. It is the first Safety Car in the world that can be used with an open cockpit. The most striking characteristics of the spectacular design are the rear wing and shortened front windscreen. “BMW i and Formula E are synonymous with innovation, making them excellently suited to each other. This project is another very good example of the pioneering spirit at BMW i and in Formula E,” said Irlinger. “In implementing the BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car, the BMW i engineers, designers and communications crew have dared to explore new horizons and create an absolutely unique car. The development team behind the Safety Car is akin to a start-up. Our engineers got creative within their own ranks and assembled it on top of their regular jobs. In doing so, they have achieved something completely new. I am very grateful to the FIA and Formula E for showing such enthusiasm towards our innovation and for making it possible to use the BMW i8 Roadster as an official Safety Car.” Agag said: “I’d like to thank the BMW i family and the Yacht Club de Monaco for hosting a great event to premiere this new addition to the ABB FIA Formula E Championship. The BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car has a striking design – something which differentiates it from anything we’ve seen before, and what better setting for its presentation than at the Monaco E-Prix. BMW has been a partner since the inaugural season, and their continued support as a vehicle partner and now as a team shows their commitment to electric mobility.” Technical modifications for use at the racetrack.Regarding stiffness the BMW i8 Roadster is the perfect basis for a Safety Car. No major modifications were necessary but there still have been some changes for the racetrack version. The most striking modification to the BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car is the front windscreen, which is shorter than the production model. This gives the car a more dynamic appearance. The Safety Car’s centre of gravity is also 15 millimetres lower than the production car. The car has M Carbon Ceramic Brakes, an FIA-approved roll bar, a front splitter and a rear wing for additional downforce. Modifications necessary for its role of Safety Car have also been made. The light bar is mounted above the rear wing, making it easily visible from all angles in any race situation. The BMW i8 Roadster Safety Car also has a communication antenna and a GPS antenna, an extensive communication system in the cockpit, and a rear-view camera. Design follows the lead of its predecessor.Another spectacular aspect of the new Safety Car is its livery design. It evolves the high-contrast BMW logo-inspired alternating blue and white schematic from the BMW iFE.18 and BMW i8 Coupe Safety Car into a decidedly expressive form suitable to open air mobility and the dazzling Monaco street racing context. Blue and purple are the natural colours of raw electricity, while the orange and green accents are the same colours as the lights system on the Safety Car. As with the BMW iFE.18, violet “synapses” surge throughout the livery making explicit the “live” connective network embedded within the design. The signature BMW Group Motorsport matt black anti-reflective cockpit extension has been updated to be inclusive of passengers, who will take their place in the passenger seat during taxi rides. The resulting “winged“ graphic also mirrors the iconic door opening kinematic of the BMW i8 Roadster. The BMW i FleetBMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 5.

New glitz for a traditional podium ceremony heralding champions. At the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2019, the winners of the eight award classes for Historic Cars and the winners of several special awards will be presented with trophies that have been completely redesigned and produced in an additive manufacturing process. The Trofeo BMW Group is traditionally presented to acknowledge the prowess of the overall winner known as the “Best of Show” for classic automobiles. This trophy, too, is radiant in a new design this year, combining traditional aesthetic creativity with modern styling. The new trophies are being presented at the press conference for the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2019. This is being held in the Teatro alla Scala in Milan at 11.30 (entry from 11.00) on Wednesday 15th May 2019.The know-how of different departments within the BMW Group has been bundled for development and production of the new honorary awards. The design process was in the hands of specialists at Designworks, the subsidiary company of the BMW Group with experience in a multitude of sectors and product areas. They have created a stylish and yet inimitable design that provides an impressive reflection of the aesthetic value and exclusivity of the vehicles receiving the awards. The crafting of the trophies was also carried out within the company at the Additive Manufacturing Centre of the BMW Group. Using the innovative 3D printing process, the conceptual drafts developed by the designers were transformed into an expressive artistic creation fashioned from a special aluminium alloy. Gilded interior surfaces, precise polishing, high-gloss burnished contours and laser engraving lend the precious trophies a unique and lustrous radiance.Designworks is a subsidiary company of the BMW Group and it has additional studios in Europe and Asia alongside its head office in the US federal state of California. The design and creative consulting company acts as an inspiring initiator for all the brands within the BMW Group. Furthermore, Designworks carries out assignments for a large array of prestigious customers from many different sectors, such as IT and consumer electronics, aircraft, medical and environmental technology, and the lifestyle and sports sector.Cutting-edge production procedures of the future were deployed to manufacture the new trophies. Using these innovative processes allowed additional scope for the creative design process. The additive production of metal objects known as 3D printing enables geometric shapes and structures to be created that could only be achieved with a large input of resources when conventional casting processes are used. The new trophies for the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este were created at the Additive Manufacturing Centre of the BMW Group in Munich. The BMW Group ranks among the pioneers in the field of additive manufacturing and makes use of the versatile procedures in development processes and for production of series components.In the course of the press conference, Ulrich Knieps, President of the Concorso d’Eleganza and Head of BMW Group Classic, will join with Danilo Zucchetti, Managing Director of Villa d’Este Hotels, and Sergio Solero, President of BMW Group Italia, to outline further details of the programme schedule.

{"prompt":"Initial exchange with over 1,500 startups from around 30 countries every year.   ‘Venture client’ model gives all business units direct access to startup innovations. BMW Group Technology Offices located at tech hotspots around the world scout for startups.  Red Dot Award: Product Design 2019 for interior architecture and interior design.   ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Startup Garage – part of the company’s Research, New Technologies and Innovations unit – has been tracking down the most innovative startups in the business for four years now, allowing the BMW Group to tap into their potential quickly and directly. So far, more than 50 up-and-coming technology companies have completed its startup programme. “Startups help us to gain an even better understanding of what personal, connected and sustainable mobility will look like in tomorrow’s world, to come up with the necessary solutions and so continue to lead the way in innovation and technology going forward,” says Bernhard Schambeck, Head of the BMW Startup Garage. The BMW Startup Garage talks with over 1,500 startups from all over the world every year. If first impressions indicate that a particular startup innovation is of potential interest for the BMW Group, it is examined in greater detail. Between 600 and 800 startups are assessed every year and a decision taken on their suitability for inclusion in the BMW Startup Garage’s programme. “We strive to bring the world’s best startups into our programme,” explained Melanie Rösler, responsible for the BMW Startup Garage programme. “We look for startup innovations that will be of substantial benefit for our products, services, systems or processes.” Instead of pursuing a venture capital approach, the BMW Startup Garage settled on a ‘venture client’ model. In their early days, many startups still don’t have a marketable product. It is precisely during this very high-risk phase that the fledgling companies are commissioned by the BMW Startup Garage, hence the term ‘venture client’. The programme’s core aim is to develop a working prototype as part of a pilot project. The BMW Group reaps the benefits of early access to the innovations and the opportunity to customise the technology before it is launch-ready. The startups, meanwhile, gain valuable insights into automotive processes, are able to build up a network of contacts within the company and are given advice on how to refine their business plan to help them gain a foothold in the automotive industry. The worldwide search for startups: thinking outside the boxThe BMW Group’s technology scouting network has a global reach. The BMW Startup Garage runs small, agile teams stationed at international technology hotspots. It now has representatives working at the BMW Group Technology Offices in Silicon Valley, Shanghai, Seoul and Tokyo. And these will be joined by a presence in Tel Aviv in the third quarter of 2019.Whereas the BMW Startup Garage initially focused primarily on innovations for the BMW Group’s products and services, since 2018 its programme has been extended to startup innovations for all business units. “The sheer range of topics we deal with makes our job in the Garage a very exciting and challenging one,” enthused Alexandra Renner, Startup Lead for Research and Development. “A normal working day can quite easily mean creating the interior of the future with startups in the morning, before turning our attention to innovations for autonomous driving in the afternoon.” A total of 26 startups completed the BMW Startup Garage programme in 2018. Long-term benefits for both startups and the BMW GroupThe support given to the startups over the course of the programme is underpinned by four pillars: Build, Sell, Learn and Network. Build and Sell involve executing the pilot project and devising a business plan. One of the elements of the Network and Learn pillars is the Deep Drive Days event, where workshops and keynote speeches give startups the opportunity to share ideas and network with employees from various BMW Group departments at length. All four of the programme’s pillars are designed to help cement long-lasting business relations with the BMW Group.“Our venture client approach really pays off, as we can see from former startups who continue to contribute their cutting-edge technologies to subsequent projects as BMW Group suppliers,” summed up Bernhard Schambeck. Lunewave and QC Ware are just two of the many startups who have worked on further projects as BMW Group partners following their participation in the programme.In its pilot project initiated as part of the BMW Startup Garage 2018 programme, Lunewave stood out with its revolutionary new sensor technology. Engineers at the Autonomous Driving Campus are now working together with Lunewave on a pre-development project to further improve the pioneering sensor concept.Quantum computers can be used to work out the type of complex problems that today’s supercomputers would need years to tackle. The BMW Group was quick to recognise the potential of this technology. The BMW Startup Garage teamed up with QC Ware to conduct various feasibility studies focusing on the application of quantum computing for specific problems, such as optimising the jobs performed by robots on the production line. Follow-up projects are already in the pipeline for 2019.“Many of the startup innovations in our pilot projects are so exciting and visionary that it’s a tough task for us not to talk about them more. We are looking forward to the innovations that will find their way into series production and our processes in the coming years,” added Schambeck. Red Dot Award for inventive interior designAgile collaboration with startups requires innovative and inspirational working environments. Careful consideration was given to this aspect from the outset in the design of the BMW Startup Garage’s premises at the BMW Group Research and Technology House in Garching, near Munich. And now its excellent use of space has earned it the coveted Red Dot Award: Product Design 2019 in the interior architecture and interior design category. The BMW Startup Garage features an elevated room-in-room concept with a spacious atrium that doubles as a presentation area, plus additional co-working spaces for brainstorming and a large meeting area. The workspaces are located at different levels within the rooms, enabling employees and visitors to enjoy visual and acoustic privacy in an open-plan space. BMW Startup Garage @ Bits & Pretzels 2019The Bits & Pretzels Conference is one of the foremost platforms for business founders, investors and innovators from all over the world. This year, the BMW Startup Garage will once again be holding its own event in Munich as part of the Bits & Pretzels Startup Night. The aim of the event is to encourage networking between the participants on the one hand and with the BMW Startup Garage team and experts from various BMW Group departments on the other. Last year, there were nearly 300 attendees, including around 100 startups. Information on how to register will be posted on the BMW Startup Garage website in due course. Links:Website: www.bmwstartupgarage.comLinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/bmw-startup-garageFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BMWStartupGarageTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/BMWStartupsBMW Group News: www.bmwgroup.com\/startupgarage\n"}
{"prompt":"Premiere in the new BMW M8 Coupe and new BMW M8 Convertible: Setup button for configuration of powertrain and chassis systems now also enables selection of braking system settings – New M Mode promotes focused driving on the road and track. ->","completion":" Munich. The feeling of an M car is unmistakable – and now it can be tailored even more closely to the individual. BMW M GmbH is unveiling a new display and control system for the configuration of the powertrain, chassis and driver assistance systems on its high-performance sports cars. As well as additional scope for adapting the vehicle settings both to the situation at hand and to personal preferences using the Setup button, drivers will also enjoy the services of the new M Mode (activated at the touch of a button). The Setup button can be used to adjust the vehicle settings, while M Mode allows the displays and driver assistance systems to be tuned to the driver’s requirements. This extra individualisation and even more intuitive operation will be included for the first time in the new BMW M8 Coupe and BMW M8 Competition Coupe With the help of these new features, drivers of BMW’s high-performance models for the luxury segment can enjoy their exceptional range of abilities – from supreme long-distance comfort to alluring track dynamics – in even greater depth.The control system developed for BMW M models traditionally enables their powertrain and chassis technology to be configured in a wide variety of ways according to personal tastes and needs. Indeed, the driver can activate various settings for the engine, suspension and steering independently of one another. In models specified with the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system, the distribution of power between the front and rear wheels can also be tweaked. And now the new BMW M8 Coupe and new BMW M8 Convertible offer the ability to configure the braking system as required, too. New Setup button enables intuitive operation with direct access to all powertrain and chassis systems.The new Setup button on the centre console of the new BMW M8 Coupe and new BMW M8 Convertible enables direct access to all available setup options for five vehicle parameters. Pressing the button brings up a Setup menu in the Control Display, which offers an overview of the vehicle settings currently engaged. The driver can then activate their desired mode for the engine, suspension, steering, brakes and M xDrive – in a single step in each case – via the touchscreen or the iDrive Controller.The engine characteristics can be adjusted by means of the EFFICIENT, SPORT and SPORT PLUS settings, while the COMFORT, SPORT and SPORT PLUS chassis options give access to the three profiles for the electronically controlled dampers. The driver can also choose between COMFORT and SPORT for both the M-specific electromechanical steering and the new braking system. When DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) is deactivated, the 4WD, 4WD SPORT and 2WD (for pure rear-wheel drive) settings for the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system also come into play. Two individually composed variants of this setup can be stored permanently with the driver’s preferred settings for the engine sound, gearshift characteristics, driving stability control and Auto Start Stop function. The overall vehicle configuration can then be called up instantly at any time by pressing one of the two M buttons on the steering wheel. Premiere in the BMW M8: integrated braking system with precise pedal feel and M-specific configurability.The M-specific version of a new braking technology paves the way for the configuration of braking characteristics, a feature available for the first time in the new BMW M8. The new system brings together the brake activation, brake booster and braking control functions within a compact module. The integrated braking system reduces weight by around two kilograms and employs a vacuum-free brake booster to enhance the car’s overall efficiency. The brake pressure required is triggered by an electric actuator, which allows it to be generated more dynamically and also ensures significantly faster and more precise interventions from the driving stability control system.The integrated braking system also does an excellent job of allowing vehicle deceleration to be geared precisely to the driver’s requirements and of generating sublime pedal feel in any situation. Braking feedback to the driver is unimpaired by wet road surfaces, significant lateral acceleration or high brake temperatures, and this ensures precise metering of braking power at all times. The version of the new braking system developed for BMW M models also presents the driver with two pedal feel settings.COMFORT and SPORT modes alter the amount of pressure on the brake pedal required to slow the car. This allows the driver to choose between a comfort-oriented perception of the braking process and a particularly direct, instantaneous response to applications of the pedal. The new BMW M8 teams this innovative system with both the standard M compound brakes and optional M carbon-ceramic brakes. Pure driving pleasure through innovation: the M Mode button.In addition to the new configuration options opened up by the Setup button, the new BMW M8 also allows the gearshift characteristics of the eight-speed Steptronic transmission to be adjusted using the Drivelogic button on the selector lever and the engine sound to be varied via a separate button on the centre console. M Dynamic Mode – which raises the intervention thresholds for the driving stability control and allows controlled drifts – and DSC Off mode can also be initiated at the touch of a button.A fresh addition to the new flagship models from BMW M GmbH is the M Mode button on the centre console. This can be used to alter the responses of the driver assistance systems and the screens in the all-digital instrument cluster and Head-Up Display. M Mode allows the driver to activate ROAD and SPORT modes, while the new BMW M8 Competition Coupe and BMW M8 Competition Convertible also come with a TRACK setting. These options enhance the hallmark M driving experience according to the situation at hand. Changing the settings alters the information presented to the driver on the screens, while the safety-enhancing interventions by the driver assistance systems – such as active braking or steering inputs – are reduced to a bare minimum or deactivated altogether.In the default ROAD setting, all the standard and optional driver assistance systems are fully activated. A simple press of the M Mode button engages the SPORT setting, in which the active driver assistance systems (in the configuration set by the driver) now only transmit alerts on speed limits and overtaking restrictions. This mode disables all interventions in the braking and steering systems, aside from those made by the Collision Warning with braking function and the Evasion Assistant.In SPORT mode, the driver benefits from M View in both the instrument cluster and the Head-Up Display. Here, only relevant information for sporty driving – i.e. an M-specific engine speed dial and the shift lights (which indicate the ideal time to change gear), a digital speed display and the gear currently engaged – is displayed in the cockpit. Information on coolant temperature, charge pressure, tyre condition, and longitudinal and lateral acceleration can be viewed in the right- and left-hand areas of the instrument cluster. The Head-Up Display read-out is concentrated around the engine revs and shift lights, navigation instructions and distance warnings, the gear selected and the vehicle speed, plus the speed limits and overtaking restrictions detected by the Speed Limit Info system. Pressing the M Mode button again returns the driver to the default ROAD mode.An extended press of the M Mode button engages TRACK mode, which is available in the Competition models and designed exclusively for use on race circuits. The decision to activate this mode must be confirmed using the iDrive Controller. In this setting, all the comfort and safety functions of the driver assistance systems are deactivated. In addition, the audio system and Control Display are both switched off in order to focus the driver’s attention even more intently on the road ahead. TRACK mode allows drivers of the new BMW M8 Competition Coupe and new BMW M8 Competition Convertible to experience an ultra-pure, racing-car-inspired distillation of M feeling. Added to which, the instrument cluster and Head-Up Display also include M View, although TRACK mode blanks out the road sign detection and distance information. Pressing the M Mode button again takes the car out of the TRACK setting and back into ROAD mode. \n"}

The 2018\/19 ‘Super Season’ in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) draws to a close on 15th\/16th June with the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA). BMW M Motorsport has now announced the six drivers who will race the two BMW M8 GTE for BMW Team MTEK on the Sarthe region track. The team’s regular drivers Martin Tomczyk (GER), Nick Catsburg (NED), António Félix da Costa (POR) and Augusto Farfus (BRA) will be joined by BMW works drivers Philipp Eng (AUT) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) at Le Mans. “The 24 Hours of Le Mans is the biggest endurance race in the world, and obviously a real highlight on our calendar,” said BMW Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. “Perhaps even more so this year than ever before. After all, we are celebrating a number of special anniversaries. It is 20 years since we took overall victory with the BMW V12 LMR and 80 years since we lined up here with the BMW 328. We want to give the fans something special, so we are bringing both historic cars to Le Mans. From a sporting perspective, we are excellently positioned with the drivers we have in the cockpits of the two BMW M8 GTE. The four regular drivers – Martin, Nick, António and Augusto – have had podium finishes in the WEC. They are joined by Philipp and Jesse – another two drivers who also have plenty of experience in the BMW M8 GTE and know what it takes to be successful in GT racing. We are looking forward to Le Mans and are now entering the final phase of preparations.” Eng will team up with Tomczyk and Catsburg in the #81 BMW M GTE, as he did in last year’s 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Austrian drives for BMW in the DTM and also regularly competes in GT races for BMW Motorsport. In January, he took victory in the GTLM class at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA), where he raced alongside Farfus. Krohn is making his Le Mans debut this year. The Finn, ‘BMW Motorsport Junior of the Year’ in 2014, is a regular driver for BMW Team RLL in the IMSA series in the USA and is also a recognised GT specialist. He will share the cockpit of the #82 BMW M8 GTE with Félix da Costa and Farfus at Le Mans. BMW Team MTEK will attend the official Le Mans test day on Sunday 2nd June. The race week begins on Sunday 9th June with the technical scrutineering in the town centre. The 24-hour race gets underway at 15:00 on Saturday 15th June.\n"}

The next round of the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) is approaching after a four-week break. The fifth event of the season is taking place this coming weekend and finished both races in sixth place. Quotes ahead of the races at Imola. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “At Imola, we aim to continue the positive trend from the last two race weekends. We have had a break since the races at Assen and have used this to continue optimising the new RR for the WorldSBK, and to drive development under racing conditions. After the cool races in Aragon and Assen, we are looking forward to some more pleasant temperatures. Imola is a circuit with a great history. We are expecting plenty of spectators and fans, and are looking forward to the weekend.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The team has had a few weeks break since Assen. The time has been spent fine tuning the overall package of the BMW S 1000 RR. BMW Motorrad Motorsport has some finer aero upgrades to implement. Additionally we will continue to focus on the chassis balance to complement the undulating and demanding Imola circuit. We are confident that both Markus and Tom can pick up from where they left off at Assen and chase down the top eight final race positions.” Tom Sykes: “I am really looking forward to the Imola round of the Superbike World Championship. It’s always a great atmosphere there; the Italian fans are really spectacular, so going there, I am very motivated with a clear target of what I would like to achieve with the BMW S 1000 RR. Unfortunately, during the races, we have some limitations when with some other riders but I think with some adaptions to the chassis set-up we can try to compensate for that. I am sure the potential of the package is very high and I think everybody has seen that when we’re on clear track and able to do what’s necessary, but obviously in the race that’s not the case, so we’re step by step working in that direction. The effort from all of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is absolutely fantastic and I really hope the track layout at Imola will help us to achieve the results we deserve.” Markus Reiterberger: “I am looking forward to getting going again. We have had quite a long break, and we have used it sensibly. After the positive weekend at Assen, I can hardly wait to finally get back on the RR. The potential is there, I am feeling more at home on the bike and we are continually making progress. I hope that we can continue this at Imola and get closer to the front. Imola is a great track that is a lot of fun. The circuit is extremely challenging for the riders and it is a very demanding place to race but I think we have a good overall package and we can record some good results. We just have to wait and see if the weather is on our side. I hope it will be a bit warmer, as it was very cold at Assen.” \n"}

BMW Motorsport has once again made DTM history. Marco Wittmann (GER) of BMW Team RMG took victory in the opening race of the 2019 season at the Hockenheimring (GER) on Saturday, and with it the first race of the new turbo era in the DTM. The two-time champion, at the wheel of the Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, produced a flawless display in wet conditions, converting pole position into a prestigious race win. This was the 12th victory of Wittmann’s career and also marked the 82nd time that a BMW has been first across the DTM finish line. It also represented the perfect start to the 50th anniversary of BMW Turbo Power in motorsport. Timo Glock (GER) finished fourth in the JiVS BMW M4 DTM, narrowly missing out on another podium for BMW. He was spun by another car on the opening lap, but fought back strongly to climb through the field one place at a time. BMW newcomer Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) came home sixth in the Shell BMW M4 DTM to score points on his debut. He was followed over the line in seventh place by the BMW Bank M4 DTM of Bruno Spengler (CAN). Joel Eriksson (SWE) was 13th in the CATL BMW M4 DTM. A sensor issue in the engine periphery prevented Philipp Eng (AUT) from setting a lap time in qualifying, meaning he had to start the race from 17th. The Austrian eventually came home 14th.Reactions to the first DTM race of the 2019 season at Hockenheim.Jens Marquardt (BMW Motorsport Director):“That is absolutely awesome. Today we have made DTM history again with BMW Motorsport, taking the first win of the new turbo era. First the pole position, then victory in the opening race for Marco Wittmann – that reminds me a little of the Formula E season opener last year, when we also started with a win. I am so proud of the whole team in Munich – of the teams and the drivers. A huge compliment goes to Marco, who did a magnificent job today at the front of the field. We have a tough winter and a tough period of testing behind us. To perform as we have done here at Hockenheim, and to win the first race, is fantastic. The experience gained during 50 years of turbo in motorsport at BMW definitely paid dividends. We have built a very good engine and put together a strong package, with which we have won at the first attempt. There is still a long way to go in the 2019 season, but today we have every reason to celebrate.”Stefan Reinhold (BMW Team RMG Team Principal):“Our team did an incredible job today. Particularly Marco Wittmann, who was in perfect control of the car in qualifying and in the race. The guys on the pit wall, the other drivers, who made up positions, and the team that prepared the cars also did a superb job. Everyone gave it 110 percent. You have to take your hat off to them. Congratulations to BMW Motorsport, who have developed a powerful engine and a great overall package. That was a superb start to the new turbo era.”Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 1st, Race: 1st, Drivers’ standings: 1st 28 points):“This win feels great. First the pole position, then the first victory of the new turbo era: what an awesome start to the season. The Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM was phenomenal in the wet. My mechanics and engineers have done a sensational job – as have BMW Motorsport, who have given me a car that was competitive from the first lap. It was an unbelievable start to the DTM year.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: 8th, Race: 4th, Drivers’ standings: 4th, 12 points):“I think we can be happy with the outcome of the result. It is a bit disappointing when you look at the pace we had yesterday and today. We were quick in the rain yesterday, and in today’s race. The only reason we weren’t as fast in qualifying was because we went out on the wrong set of tyres once. I had a very good start and was up there with the top five, but was then hit from behind. That dropped me well back down the field. We had good pace at the end, which allowed us to fight our way back into the top five. It showed what could have been. Congratulations to Marco and the whole team on the win.”Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG, Grid: 14th, Race: 7th, Drivers’ standings: 7th, 6 points):“The race was okay. I had a super start. Unfortunately, Timo was spun in front of me, which caused me to lose some time on the way out of turn two. Despite that, climbing from 14th to seventh is a good result and we scored some good points. Congratulations to Marco on his win. After all the hard work over the winter, the team more than deserves that. Seventh place is okay for me. If I had stopped a little later, I might have been able to do even better but that is alright. We are now turning our attention to tomorrow.” Bart Mampaey (BMW Team RBM Team Principal):“Firstly, congratulations to BMW. It is obviously fantastic to win the first race with the new turbo engine. Our rookie, Sheldon van der Linde, had a great debut, finishing sixth and scoring his first points. In the case of Philipp Eng, we were able, after a long time looking, to find the reason for our technical issues. That meant he was at least able to start the race. However, our strategy did not ultimately pay off for him or Joel Eriksson.”Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 7th, Race: 6th, Drivers’ standings: 6th, 8 points):“The day could hardly have gone better for me. I could never have dreamed of scoring points as a rookie in my first DTM race. I have a fantastic team behind me. Everyone has been very helpful. The car was very good in the race. Congratulations to Marco and BMW on the win.”Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR, Grid: no time, Race: 14th, Drivers’ standings: 15th, 0 points):“That was a tough day. I can only thank my guys, who were meticulous in their search for the issue on my car – and found it. I hope things run more smoothly tomorrow.”Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM, Grid: 9th, Race: 13th, Drivers’ standings: 14th, 0 points):“That was not a good race for me. The start was good, but after that we struggled with the car. I could not really push. We have a bit of work ahead of us now to come back stronger tomorrow. Congratulations to Marco on his win.”\n"}

After a mediocre race three weeks ago at Long Beach (USA), the team is looking to bounce back in style at its home race. As shown last season, the 3.86-kilometre circuit proved much more to the BMW M8 GTE’s liking than Long Beach’s temporary street track. In the GTLM class, John Edwards (USA) secured pole position in the #24 BMW M8 GTE, before Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Alexander Sims (GBR) ended the race in second place in the #25 sister car. The #25 BMW M8 GTE will be driven by De Phillippi and Tom Blomqvist (GBR), while John Edwards and Jesse Krohn (FIN) pair up in the #24 car. De Phillippi, in fifth place, is the top-standing BMW driver in GTLM Driver points. After three races, BMW stands second in GTLM manufacturer points. The race gets underway at 1:40 p.m. local time : “Mid-Ohio is the teams home race and an important one not only for the team but for the championship. We didn't have the best of weekends at Long Beach so it is important to get a strong result. Mid-Ohio was a new track for me last year so I had to learn the track quickly in the free practice. This year will be much easier as we can go straight into fine tuning the car for the weekend instead of having to learn the track in free practice. All in all I like the track and it suits our car well so I am expecting a strong weekend.”\n"}

Timo Glock (GER), Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Marco Wittmann (GER) represent BMW Team RMG. Philipp Eng (AUT), Joel Eriksson (SWE) and rookie Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) start for BMW Team RBM. The BMW M4 DTM is powered by a new two-litre R4 turbo engine, which has been developed from scratch and generates over 600 hp – the P48. The move to turbo engines is one of many innovations in the DTM. The aerodynamics have also been modified and the weight of the car reduced. Furthermore, a push-to-pass system, which allows drivers to briefly call on more power for overtaking manoeuvres, has been introduced. Quotes ahead of the DTM opener at Hockenheim. Jens Marquardt (BMW Motorsport Director): “The start of the season is always a highlight, but we are particularly excited this year. We are entering a new era with the DTM. With the new turbo engine in the BMW M4 DTM, we are taking up the success story of 50 years of BMW Turbo Power in motorsport. We have already enjoyed exciting and thrilling races in the past. With the innovations for the 2019 season, however, the DTM is shifting up a gear in terms of excitement. At the same time, we are also pleased to have a fantastic new manufacturer and competitor in Aston Martin. It will be very interesting to see how the balance of power develops at Hockenheim. The regulations have really shaken things up for 2019 and all will be revealed at the opening race weekend. However, one thing is certain: fans can look forward to spectacular races with lots of action – and we want to have a big say in the battle for the top step of the podium.” Stefan Reinhold (Team Principal BMW Team RMG):“After the six-month winter break with a very tiring test season and a lot of innovations, such as the turbo engine, we will be as well prepared as possible when we get to Hockenheim. It is always exciting, after all the time spent developing, to arrive at the first race weekend with a new car like the BMW M4 DTM. We have very few changes in the team and line up with a well-oiled crew. New on the driver side is Bruno Spengler, and we are very much looking forward to working with him. As a team, we want to prepare our new cars as well as possible for the first races of the season. We will work hard to be well positioned when we finally go racing again.” Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG):“The anticipation and excitement are huge, as we are entering a new era in the DTM. I don’t believe anybody really knows what to expect. There is still a bit of a question mark hanging over us, and we will get the answer at Hockenheim. As such, there is already a lot of tension. It goes without saying that I am already looking forward to the fans and the atmosphere at the season-opener at Hockenheim. Racing there is simply awesome. I can hardly wait and am very determined to do well.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG):“After the long winter break, I am looking forward to getting started and finally seeing the fans at the racetrack again. Hockenheim will undoubtedly be as brilliant as ever. I think we can look forward to an exciting start to the season, particularly as we enter this new era with the new engines and a new third manufacturer in Aston Martin. We will also see what the actual balance of power is there. Not everyone showed all their cards at the test at the Lausitzring. When it comes down to it, the first time everything is revealed will be in qualifying at Hockenheim. Then we will see where we really are.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR):“I am looking forward to getting going again. The first race is always a highlight, particularly at Hockenheim. The weekend there will finally shed a little light on where we stand compared to the others. Up to now, that has been impossible to deduce. I am very intrigued to see how the opening weekend pans out for us.” Bart Mampaey (Team Principal BMW Team RBM):“First of all, it has been a tremendous challenge – the new car and the new engine. The winter has been full of hard development work, which is always tough around a state-of-the-art race car like we have. I think that we go to Hockenheim with high expectations. We want to be competitive with all three drivers. We want to be on the zero-mistake level; I think it’s very important because reliability will come into play as well. We want to finish both races with all three drivers, have safe races and see where we are as a package – as a team, as a car, as a manufacturer and in combination with the drivers. We will do our absolute best to get the maximum out of it but it is very difficult to make a prediction. So, let’s roll the dice and let’s see.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR):“The anticipation ahead of finally racing in the DTM again is huge. Nothing else gives me the feeling that goes through my body when I am on the DTM grid, just before the lights go out. It is really very exciting. The wait is finally over. After all the preparation, I just want to go racing again now.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 Shell BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM):“Hockenheim is going to be cool. It’s going to be a big weekend for me. Obviously it’s my debut in the DTM, so a lot of things are going on, apart from the driving. It’s going to be interesting to manage all these factors. Out on the track, however, I obviously can’t wait to be on the starting grid at Hockenheim. We have quite high expectations as usual but let’s see where we end up. We should also be reasonable. It’s my first season in the DTM, so I have to learn a lot, also from my team-mates, but so far it has been going very well.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM):“I am super excited. I think everyone is, but especially as a driver it’s special to sit behind the wheel when you have a completely new engine under the hood. They will be very interesting and entertaining races. We also have the push-to-pass system now, that adds even more excitement. Last year, the first race weekend was pretty cool and insane, and I think it will be the same this year. I can’t wait to come to Hockenheim. I’m sure it will be really great racing.” Media Schedule (all times CEST). Friday, 3rd May11.30-12.00, ITR press conference with Sheldon van der Linde, Baden-Württemberg Center, 4th floor Saturday, 4th May15.50-16.00, Mixed Zone with all BMW drivers, Baden-Württemberg Center, 4th floor Sunday, 5th May09.30-10.00, Media round table with BMW Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt, BMW Hospitality 15.50-16.00, Mixed Zone with all BMW drivers, Baden-Württemberg Center, 4th floor\n"}

Alexander Sims (GBR) retired from the Paris E-Prix after his involvement in an accident through no fault of his own. The eighth race of the Formula E season endured some turbulent phases after starting behind the BMW i8 Coupé Safety Car on a partially wet circuit. Periodic rainfall continued to affect proceedings, and an unexpected hailstorm caused plenty of collisions and position changes. Félix da Costa managed to stay out of trouble and some calm driving saw him work his way up to seventh place. He is now in third place in the drivers’ standings with 70 points, eleven points behind leader Robin Frijns (NED, Virgin Racing), who won the Paris E-Prix. BMW i Andretti Motorsport remains fifth in the team championship, with 88 points. Sims’ race day ended around 22 minutes before the end. On a wet surface, he was rear-ended by Oliver Rowland (GBR, Nissan) entering a corner and turned sharply into the crash barriers. The BMW iFE.18 was too badly damaged to continue the race. Reactions to the Paris E-Prix: Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport team principal):“The race was like the April weather here in Paris. The 32 laps had pretty much all the turmoil you could imagine. Unfortunately, Alexander Sims got caught up in an accident that wasn't his fault. He is having a tough time right now and just isn't getting the luck he needs to experience a trouble-free race weekend. António put on a very mature performance. It was a shame that the difficult conditions in qualifying meant that we were unable to get the best speed out of the car. However, he worked his way through the field during the race and made the most of every chance he got when his competitors slipped up. The points he scored here could be very valuable at the end of the season.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 16th place, race result: 7th place, FANBOOST voting: 2nd place, points: 70):“I think we managed to drive a smart race again, keep out of all the trouble and score some important points to stay in the running for the title.

Beyond the extensive commitment to the arts, BMW cooperates with the opera house Staatsoper Unter den Linden and invites this year again to the long-standing open-air format “State Opera for All” on June 15 and 16, 2019.On an international scale, the BMW Group continues to support joint formats with numerous cultural institutions as well as art fairs. In cooperation with Tate Modern in London, BMW introduced the format “BMW Tate Live” – a long-term partnership, which focuses on performance, interdisciplinary art and curating digital space. Since 2015, BMW and Art Basel annually send emerging artists on the “BMW Art Journey” – a journey of their own choice to develop new ideas and create new projects. Alongside the Art Basel and its two offshoots in Miami Beach and Hong Kong, BMW also cooperates with the TEFAF in Maastricht, the Paris Photo, and the Frieze art fairs in London, New York and Los Angeles as well as the Frieze Masters. In autumn 2017, BMW and Frieze launched their new initiative “BMW Open Work”. Drawing inspiration from BMW design, engineering and technology, the commissioned artists consider current and future technologies as tools for innovation and artistic experimentation. Furthermore, in the context of BMW’s cooperation with Soho House, an Art & Design talk takes place during the majority of these fairs. In 2018 the latest edition of the “BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors” was launched. This joint publication of the BMW Group and Independent Collectors provides an overview on the most significant private collections on a global scale.\n"}

This week, it was all about the DTM again at the Lausitzring (GER). From Monday to Thursday, the six BMW drivers and their rivals were underway on the 4.570-kilometre track. In total, the BMW squads completed over 1,250 laps and 5,500 kilometres. BMW Team RBM, BMW Team RMG and the drivers used the test to prepare themselves and the 2019 BMW M4 DTM for the start of the season. At the heart of the race car is the new BMW P48 turbo engine, which was developed from scratch in accordance with Class 1 regulations. The BMW M4 DTM has also been modified extensively in many other areas. The annual DTM ‘Media Day’ also took place at the Lausitzring on the Tuesday of the test. The opening round of the 2019 DTM season takes place from 3rd to 5th May at the Hockenheimring (GER). Quotes from the DTM test at the Lausitzring: Jens Marquardt (BMW Motorsport Director):“That was a very intense final test for our teams and drivers before the DTM season-opener. A big thank you goes to the mechanics and engineers, who have worked hard and shown great commitment during these long days of testing. The whole system of the 2019 cars is completely new. As such, it is obvious that you are going to learn and gain experience with every single lap. The first two days did not exactly go as we had imagined. However, the whole team – including the drivers – showed how flexible they can be during this phase, and did not let it unsettle them. We were then able to complete a lot of laps on Wednesday and Thursday. On the whole, our focus was on confirming the new components in the system and on better understanding the car as a whole. We have made big progress in that regard. In terms of performance, we completed all our planned preparations, in order to arrive in Hockenheim in good form. As always, only the first qualifying sessions and races will give a true indication of where we are. We are really looking forward to the start of the season.” Bruno Spengler (#7 BMW Bank M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG):“Before the start of the season, it was very important to do more testing, get behind the wheel of the car again, make any final adjustments to the set-up, and prepare for the first races. It was also important for me and my new race engineer to forge a relationship and find a rhythm together. We worked our way through a good programme. That was important. Now we move on to the opening round. I am already looking forward to us all meeting up again at Hockenheim in a fortnight. We will then have more of an idea of where we all stand.” Marco Wittmann (#11 Schaeffler BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMG):“A test like this is always important – particularly this season, with the new regulations and new engine. After all the work we put into development during the winter, it was good to add the finishing touches here. There was the odd problem here and there, but that is the same with every manufacturer at the moment. We now have to iron them out until the start of the season. As such, it was very good to go driving again at the Lausitzring. We are all naturally intrigued to see how the season-opener pans out, and how good we actually are.” Timo Glock (#16 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR):“I would obviously have liked to have a few more laps in the car, but the fact that I drove in the winter tests meant my time here was a little limited. We made the most of the time, to be well prepared for Hockenheim. We will take the positives out of the test and now start our final preparations for the first races.” Philipp Eng (#25 ZF BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RMR):“It was cool to be back in a DTM car after a long break. The BMW M4 DTM is an incredible racing car, particularly with the new engine. It was great fun finding my rhythm again and sorting a few things out. We still have some work ahead of us before the first race at Hockenheim, but everyone is doing their utmost to ensure we are up there at the front of the field there again.” Sheldon van der Linde (#31 BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM):“It’s really been an enjoyable test. I’ve got a lot of laps in the car which is very nice. It was also an important test for me because it was good to just get used to the car. The new turbo engine is really powerful, it’s a lot of fun to drive it and it should make things interesting this year.” Joel Eriksson (#47 CATL BMW M4 DTM, BMW Team RBM):“On the first two days, we had slight issues, but that was solved and everything is looking good and promising. I am actually feeling very comfortable with the car. Everything is quite new for everyone but its working fine for me. There are still a few things to improve but that’s the same for everyone. I am feeling positive.” \n"}

The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team scored more points with the new BMW S 1000 RR at Assen (NED) than any other race weekend so far in this season’s FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Markus Reiterberger (GER) finished sixth in the two races, which were both held on Sunday. Team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) came home tenth and seventh. The duo’s haul for the weekend was 35 points – their biggest score so far. The TT Circuit Assen hosted round four of the 2019 WorldSBK season. Race one, which was postponed due to snow on Saturday, was held on Sunday morning. It was followed in the afternoon by race two. Reiterberger started both races from third on the grid with Sykes in sixth. Reiterberger climbed into second place thanks to an outstanding start in race one. For seven laps, he was hot on the heels of leader Alvaro Bautista (ESP \/ Ducati) before dropping a few positions. Despite that, Reiterberger still came home sixth to claim his best result of the season so far. Sykes was running eighth going into the final lap, but unfortunately conceded two places late on. In race two, Reiterberger initially dropped back to seventh, but was always in touch with the leading group. Sykes fell to ninth place after the start, but soon climbed into eighth place behind Reiterberger. Both riders passed Leon Haslam (GBR \/ Kawasaki) in the final stages of the race. Reiterberger crossed the finish line in sixth place again, followed just 0.014 seconds later by Sykes in seventh. Quotes after the races at Assen. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We can be very happy with the race weekend at Assen. We are continuing to move in the right direction and are closing in on the front-runners. Markus, in particular, took a very big step forward. With third place on the grid and two top-six finishes, he has shown that he is feeling more and more comfortable on the RR. Tom’s results do not reflect his performance. In Superpole, the red flag cost him a place towards the very front of the grid. The two races were not easy for him, starting from sixth place. I am sure, under different circumstances, that his results could have been better. After back-to-back races in Aragón and Assen, we now have a four-week break before the next round at Imola. We will use that time to work on more updates for our new BMW S 1000 RR, to ensure that we continue to move forward.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It’s been a very positive weekend for Markus and after quite a difficult Aragón round, he has turned things around here at Assen. He really deserves his two sixth-place race finishes and his third position for both starts. The hard work paid off and he finally found a good direction to carry forward with; hopefully this is transferable to Imola and he can pick up where he’s left off here at Assen. So: well done, Markus. Tom’s a little bit frustrated. The red flag in Superpole put him on the second row while it could have been a front row start. He had two average starts in the races and it took him too long to get back into a strong position again, so both races where difficult for him. Race one in particular, because he overrode the front, lost all the grip of the front tyre and so the lap times got slower and he ended up going backwards. In the second race he tried a SC0 rear tyre which he didn’t get working hard enough, he came strong in the race too late but he managed to pick off Leon Haslam to get seventh at the flag and almost beat his team-mate. We will take the positives from Assen, four strong points scoring positions overall and we are looking forward to Imola.” Markus Reiterberger: “I am really happy. The weekend at Assen was great and a big thank you goes to my team for their hard work. We have taken another step and I felt really good on the RR all weekend. I got off to a great start in the opening race and was able to match the pace at the front of the field for the first few laps. After seven or eight laps, however, I had a few issues with the grip on the rear tyre – there was quite a lot of movement entering and exiting the corners. I took wider lines and consequently made two mistakes, and at one point I was forced off while overtaking. Despite that, however, I was able to finish in the top six. The second race also went well. We made a few changes to the balance of the bike. Unfortunately, my start was not so good in race two and we lost a few positions. I was able to maintain the same level for a relatively long time. In the end, I fancied myself to finish fifth, but I lost a lot of time behind (Leon) Haslam. That allowed (Chaz) Davies to escape in fifth place. We can now recharge our batteries a bit and prepare for the next races. We are heading in the right direction and will continue to work on further improving the chassis.” Tom Sykes: “Everyone has seen the potential of the BMW S 1000 RR is high considering how early the project is. Although the positions weren’t what I was hoping for today, on the positive side we have gained a lot of information. I was able to see where I am losing out and during the race that confirmed it. We will try to improve now where we are missing out and moving forward we know that we will progress on this in the next race. Markus rode really well today; I knew he would be strong from his race here last year on the Superstock bike. One of the positives we can take forward is that in general the RR is heading in the right direction. We have been consistently around five seconds from P2 in most races so given my experience and the level of the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, I think we will get to where we need to be through the season.” \n"}

For the first time in this IMSA WeatherTechSportsCar Championship season, BMW Team RLL and the BMW M8 GTE weren’t able to contest for podium finishes. In the ‘IMSA Bubba Burger Sports Car Grand Prix’ at Long Beach (USA), the #25 BMW M8 GTE, driven by Tom Blomqvist (GBR) and Connor De Phillippi (USA), finished seventh in the GTLM class. John Edwards (USA) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) finished eighth in the #24 BMW M8 GTE. Edwards was running fifth before the only pit stop of the race, but a problem with a loose wheel-nut on the tyre change firstly cost the team some time to fix and then resulted in a drive through penalty. The 100-minute race was won by the #912 Porsche. Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “We felt this circuit was not going to be in our wheelhouse, as they say. All we can do is to keep working hard and doing what we can do and hope that we are able to find the pace compared to the other teams who currently have an advantage on us.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M8 GTE, 7th place): “During the first part of my stint we seemed very competitive and I was happy with the car in comparison to yesterday. As the stint went on however, the others just seemed to have a bit more pace than we did but we knew that this weekend was going to be a difficult weekend for us. The next tracks suit our car really well and we will focus on fighting for podiums again in the next events.” Tom Blomqvist (#25 BMW M8 GTE, 7th place): “We simply did not have the pace this weekend to really challenge the competition. We just had to run a smart race but there simply was not enough that happened for us to make any gains. So, now we look ahead to Mid-Ohio, a track that should suit us a bit more.” John Edwards (#24 BMW M8 GTE, 8th place): “A disappointing result but the car was much improved over yesterday’s qualifying so our pace was a bit better. Unfortunately it is a very short weekend so if the car is not right in qualifying you start in the wrong spot. We were able to move up a couple of spots but then had trouble on the pit stop.” Jesse Krohn (#24 BMW M8 GTE, 8th place): “Today was difficult. At the end of the day we didn’t have a bad race car, we just got a little bit unlucky in the pit stop. Something happened with the rear tyre, I do not know exactly what but just cannot recover from such an incident a short race such as Long Beach. Overall, I am happy with the steps we made with the car and even starting last, without the tyre issue, there was a chance to maybe make something happen.”\n"}

Alexander Sims (GBR) was unlucky and ended the Geox Rome E-Prix in 17th place. ->","completion":" Rome. António Félix da Costa (POR) finished ninth to pick up more points for BMW i Andretti Motorsport in an eventful seventh race of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E Championship. Alexander Sims (GBR) was unlucky and ended the Geox Rome E-Prix in 17th place. As the leader in the Drivers’ Championship, Félix da Costa went out in the first group in qualifying. Although he was the fastest in that group, he ultimately had to settle for 13th place. The first group once again had to contend with the toughest track conditions, which prevented any faster lap times. Grid penalties awarded to two competitors saw Félix da Costa promoted to eleventh place on the grid. The E-Prix was suspended as early as lap two, however, following a crash. It was 45 minutes before the cars were able to return to the track behind the BMW i8 Coupé Safety Car. Stuck in the pack, Félix da Costa fought hard for every position throughout the race, and eventually came home in a hard-earned ninth place. The Portuguese driver is now second in the Drivers’ Championship, while BMW i Andretti Motorsport lies fifth in the Team standings. Sims was struck by misfortune as early as qualifying. A technical issue brought him to a halt on his flying lap, meaning he had to start the race from the back of the field. He then damaged the front of his BMW iFE.18 on the slippery track on lap one. After the restart, he was handed a 10-second stop-and-go penalty by race control. Sims eventually crossed the finish line in 17th place. Victory went to Mitch Evans (AUS, Jaguar Racing). Reactions to the Rome E-Prix: Jens Marquardt (BMW Motorsport Director):“Formula E was as unpredictable as ever in the first European race of the season. The race was suspended again and fans were treated to a feast of action out on the track. António came home ninth to pick up points again. That was all he could hope for today, but these points could prove very valuable come the end of the season. Alexander found himself stuck towards the back of the field after technical difficulties in qualifying forced him to start from last place on the grid. He eventually finished 17th. We will now focus on preparing for Paris. Congratulations to Jaguar on their first Formula E victory.” Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“The race was a good lesson in damage limitation for us. Given our starting positions, it was all about keeping António among the front-runners in the Drivers’ Championship. We have managed that. He is second, just one point behind the leader, and had a few battles in the midfield in today’s race. The focus through all this was always on bringing the car home and scoring valuable points. Alexander could not do much from last place on the grid, especially when he then received the penalty. Despite that, he used the race to learn as much as possible, looking ahead to the rest of the season.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 13th place, race result: 9th place, FANBOOST voting: 2nd place, points: 64):“Firstly, it is important to have scored some points again and to stay in touch at the top of the Drivers’ Championship. Despite that, I am a little frustrated, as our car was far faster today than we were able to show in the race. Unfortunately, the qualifying group put paid to that. It is extremely difficult to climb out of the pack and to the front of the field in Formula E.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 22nd place, race result: 17th place, FANBOOST voting: 16th place, points: 18)“That was a really tough day for me. I actually adapted to the track very well in my practice sessions and was going really well, however, the rest of the day was basically ruined after the technical issue in qualifying. Starting from last place on the grid, all you can really do is to complete a lot of laps and learn as much as possible. I have seen once again that an incredible amount can happen in Formula E, which is impossible to predict. Despite all that, I am confident that I have good pace. We just have to have one problem-free race. I will be striving for that again in Paris.” The BMW i FleetBMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 5.

Saturday’s Assen (NED) action was shorter than expected for the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. The afternoon’s opening race was cancelled due to snow. In the morning’s Superpole qualifying session, Markus Reiterberger (GER) had clocked the third fastest time on his BMW S 1000 RR, earning himself a place on the front row of the grid for the first time in his WorldSBK career. Lady Luck was not on the side of his team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR), whose flying Superpole lap was interrupted by a red flag. The British rider ultimately had to settle for sixth place. The two BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team riders had shown in Friday’s practice that they are quick at Assen. Sykes set the fastest time of the day on his RR, while Reiterberger was fourth fastest. They then continued where they left off in the third practice session on Saturday morning with second place for Sykes and fourth for Reiterberger. Superpole was red flagged and ended with just one minute of qualifying remaining. Reiterberger was third at the time. Sykes, on the other hand, had just set by far the fastest time in sector one when the red flags appeared. As such, he had to settle for sixth place and the second row of the grid. The start of the race was initially delayed as snow started to fall, but was subsequently cancelled. The race will be held tomorrow at 11:00 instead of the Superpole Race while race two will be started as usual at 14:00. Quotes after Saturday at Assen. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We brought more updates for the RR to Assen, which have allowed us to take another step forward. Markus is feeling better all the time on the bike, and it is great to see him secure a place on the front row for the first time. Unfortunately, the red flag came at the wrong time for Tom in Superpole – it was definitely going to be a fantastic lap time. We then had typically crazy April weather in the afternoon. There was no chance of us going racing when the snow started to fall. We must now hope that the weather is better tomorrow. Our goal is to convert the good performances we have shown so far into corresponding results this weekend.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am really pleased for Markus to get that front row start. It was a good, clean and solid lap from him. There might have been a little bit more in there but nevertheless a front row start. Flip downside for that was Tom obviously never got the chance to complete his lap which at the time the red flag came out was certainly clearly going to be a pole position for him so that was a real shame. The rest of the day has been a bit of a hanging around day, kicking our heels and waiting for the outcome from race direction which quite rightly called the end of the racing for the weather conditions.” Markus Reiterberger: “I felt really good all weekend. I am grateful to the team that we have made so much progress. Third place in Superpole was awesome, as I have never started from the front row. We’ve only made a few changes before the third practice session, because it was so cold. The air temperature was zero degrees Celsius or below at times, while the track temperature was just three degrees. It went really well and I was fourth fastest. We started Superpole on race tyres and the first six laps were very good. We then went out on the qualifying tyres really early, which ultimately worked in my favour. When the session was suspended, I was assured of the third spot on the front row. The cancellation of the race was a pity for the fans here but I was honestly pretty glad about the decision. The track conditions were far from ideal and it would not have been without risk to race under these conditions.” Tom Sykes: “It was a very strange day considering the weather but having said that I am happy with our progress again over the weekend. The whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is working again in an effective way. We got a lot of information in FP1 which enabled us to improve the set-up of the BMW S 1000 RR. We’ve been consistently where we needed to be over the course of the weekend. Superpole was going to plan, we put the qualifying tyre in and the bike was on rails. In the first sector it was very easy to ride and the extra grip certainly enabled me to do a few more things with the set-up and the way I rode the bike. Sure the lap time would have been nice and probably could have secured pole position but it is what it is. I’m mainly disappointed to start from the second row because we have been inside the top three all weekend and then just got caught out with the red flag, but I am confident for the race. I want to get a good start and use the clear track to our advantage. That’s in an ideal world; I just don’t want to get caught up in the turns because with our bike set-up we are able some really good things with the chassis and that’s why I am able to do such a good lap time. So we’ll try to get to the front or into the top three as soon as we can.” \n"}
{"prompt":"Historic motor sport at the Nuremberg city circuit on the first weekend of July – 40 years after its debut on the race track, BMW Group Classic is lining up 14 legendary BMW M1 cars from the Procar Series at the start.  ->","completion":" Munich. 40 years after the start of the Procar Series launched specially for the BMW M1, the Procar will once again be captivating motor-sport fans. As part of the races for the German Touring Car Championship (DTM) on the Norisring , 14 BMW M1s will be making a spectacular comeback on the track. This racing car was produced in conformity with the Group 4 regulations prevailing at the time and Formula 1 drivers and international privateer drivers then competed against each other. BMW Group Classic has also been able to rekindle the enthusiasm of famous drivers for a return to the cockpit of the BMW M1 for the Procar Revival at the Nuremberg city racing circuit. Former Formula 1 drivers Jan Lammers from the Netherlands and Marc Surer from Switzerland are two motor-sport legends who will be lining up at the start. They were already darlings of the public in the original Procar races four decades ago.BMW Group Classic is recalling many different memories of the extraordinary race-track debut of the BMW M1 with historic motor sport in the warm-up programme for the German Touring Car Masters. The mid-engined sports car was developed for racing competitions and road registration, and launched in autumn 1978. Since delays in the production process prevented homologation by the deadline, the Managing Director of BMW Motorsport GmbH at the time, Jochen Neerpasch, worked together with the Formula 1 managers Max Moseley and Bernie Ecclestone to create a completely new race series. A total of 19 races were carried in the Procar Series in the years 1979 and 1980 and this developed into an ideal forum for the subsequent success of the BMW M1 in other international competitions.The Procar races carried out as part of the warm-up programme for the European Grand Prix rounds gave privateer drivers and talented juniors the opportunity to race against the top stars of motor sport in BMW M1 cars with technically identical engineering. The five fastest drivers out of the Formula 1 drivers at the Friday training session qualified in each case to race in the BMW M1. Celebrity drivers like Niki Lauda, Nelson Piquet, Alan Jones, Jacques Laffite and Emerson Fittipaldi loved driving round the thrilling curves with the fast and agile mid-engined racer. The BMW M1 generated 470 hp and the driver’s skill was the sole factor in determining who was victorious at the end of the race – this was instrumental in generating maximum excitement at every venue and it helped to make the Procar Series extremely popular.The overall winner of the first Procar season was Niki Lauda. In the following year, Nelson Piquet took first place in the overall standings with three wins in succession. The BMW M1 continued its motor-sport career in other competitions such as the German Automobile Racing Championship and in the American IMSA GTO Championship. As a Group 5 racing car with turbocharger for its inline six-cylinder engine, an output of up to 1000 hp and imposing spoilers, the car also ranked there as one of the most spectacular and successful representatives of its era.The Procar Series remains the most important chapter in the racing history of the BMW M1 to this day. 30 years after the debut of the mid-engined sports car, a Procar Revival in 2008 attracted fans of historic motor sport to the Hockenheimring. This circuit was the showplace for a Procar Series race in 1979 and 1980 and a lot of former drivers took the opportunity to try their luck competing in the BMW M1 once again. Another Procar Revival took place before the race for the “Austrian Grand Prix” at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg two years ago. The Austrian Formula 1 circuit is also among those circuits where races in the legendary Procar Series were held.Procar racers are also not being hosted for the first time at the Norisring. In the second season of the previous race series, one of the Procar races started on the city circuit. At that time, the German racing driver Hans-Joachim Stuck won the race ahead of Jan Lammers and Marc Surer.\n"}

It’s all go in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Just one week after the MotorLand Aragón (ESP) races, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Markus Reiterberger (GER) will be in action on their new BMW S 1000 RR Superbikes at Assen in the Netherlands. The fourth round of the 2019 WorldSBK season will be held at the TT Circuit with a rich tradition this weekend , where BMW Motorrad number three million – a BMW S 1000 RR – came off the production line on Tuesday, in a year when motorcycle production at the BMW Group plant in Berlin celebrates its 50th anniversary. The Berlin factory has been producing motorcycles and sending them across the world since 1969. This double anniversary was marked with an official ceremony on Tuesday. For Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, the anniversary is “the result of hard work and a clear course that the company, workforce and policy followed consistently.” Quotes ahead of the races at Assen. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “I’m very positive about Assen. The track should suit us a bit better, partly because of the layout, and partly because both riders really love the track. Even though the period between the two races is very short, we have another few developments that we want to try out. I hope that the temperatures won’t be sub-zero, but anything above zero degrees won’t be a problem for our motorcycle. We also do relatively well in cold conditions. In any case, I am feeling good.” “The Berlin visit was great and our collaboration with Berlin is very important. We receive a lot of support from production in many areas – at home in Munich in development, and in Berlin when it comes to providing parts, and last but not least, our engine production takes place in Berlin. It was also nice to experience how the positive energy that we triggered with the WorldSBK project could also be felt in Berlin. You could see how interested the workforce was, and how the employees took the opportunity to meet the riders up close and personal.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Of all of the very early races in the season Assen is the one I’ve been looking forward to and I think it can be a really good weekend for us. Markus has had very strong results in the past in the European Superstock Championship and Tom obviously won a race there last year, so it’s a good circuit for him. And the biggest point for me is that our RR will be reasonably competitive there. It’s a very technical, twisty circuit, it’s got a lot of flowing corners with only kind of one and a half straights where we will get hurt a little bit. Generally, the mood is that we were taking steps forward at Aragón and Assen should be a positive circuit for us.” Tom Sykes: “We’re coming off the back of a strong race weekend and obviously for me I need to try and take every opportunity – and for me, Assen is perhaps one of those opportunities. I’m enjoying my racing, I’m certainly enjoying riding the BMW S 1000 RR and during the twisty sectors we’re proving to have a very competitive package. In Assen my only concern is the exit of T4 where you have a kind of first to sixth gear straight. Apart from that, I feel that we will be very competitive. The weather looks to be particularly cold and we had a very strong pace in the cold weather at Aragón, so it would just be nice to go there with great expectations and try to meet those. The rest is out of my hands. We are still developing during race weekends but the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is doing a great job and we will just continue doing what we are doing.” “It was a pleasure to be invited to share such a special event for BMW as the one in Berlin. I’m still very new to the BMW family but I feel very welcomed. As a race rider you appreciate this warmth – or I certainly do. It was great to talk to the guys about the handling of the BMW S 1000 RR and how all the electronics are working. We’ve also been using a very basic engine during our racing season so far which is very, very impressive when you race against all the established top teams. I would just like to say a big thanks and show my appreciation to the entire staff in Munich and Berlin for doing an outstanding job.” Markus Reiterberger: “I know Assen really well. I must have completed a million laps there already. The weather there is always an exciting factor; no doubt it will be the same again this year. I’m expecting to get a lot from this weekend. We saw a positive trend in Aragón; I feel more comfortable on the bike now, I can work with it, and hope that we will take another step in the right direction at Assen. I also hope we will be spared any storms, do a good job and can deliver a good race, and that we will just be able to race without any bad luck.” “It was great to be at the event in Berlin. It’s always something special. I’ve been to Berlin a few times and I really enjoyed the factory tour again this time – you learn something new every time. It was a special moment when bike number three million rode in and seeing all the employees up close and personal. They were really excited to meet us. Everyone told us that they follow our races, and getting to meet these people personally was a unique opportunity. I’m delighted that we discovered so much support in the factory, and I’d like to express my thanks for that.” \n"}

We can be really pleased with that. Our objective for the European opener in Rome is to convert the great potential of our drivetrain into good results even more consistently than we have done so far and to pick up points with both drivers. It’s a very ambitious goal in this championship, but I’m certain that we can do it. We want to put on a strong show for BMW fans in Europe as well.” Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“The BMW i Andretti Motorsport team is excited to kick off the European portion of the ABB Formula E season. After another podium finish in Sanya, going to Rome leading the championship with António Félix da Costa is a great place to be at the halfway point of the season. With the Rome track being the longest of the season, with a lot of challenging turns, a premium will be placed on finding the most amount of grip from the Michelin tyres in addition to monitoring the loads placed on the brakes. Looking at the weather forecast, it looks like the heat experienced in Sanya will be a thing of the past, with much cooler conditions for both car and personnel.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18):“It’s cool to be returning to Europe for the second half of the season. We have consistently shown great potential in the races so far, but unfortunately we haven’t got the results to go with it. There have been many reasons for this, which we have analysed so that we can do better in the second half of the season.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18):“We head to Rome bolstered by a good result and a strong performance. We looked really good in both qualifying and the race in Sanya. The fact that I have taken the lead in the driver standings is great motivation for not only me, but the entire team. The track in Rome should suit us again. I had a lot of fun there last year.

{"prompt":"Collaboration between BMW and the up-and-coming young photographer from London taps into new, unconventional angles on current BMW models. The official start of the campaign is a photo shoot with the BMW Z4 in the Californian desert.  Next motif: the BMW i8 Roadster in the exclusive design of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.   ->","completion":" Munich. He loves analogue black-and-white photography and tattoos – clearly, Brooklyn Beckham is as difficult to pigeonhole as the new BMW Z4, which combines the classic vehicle concept of the roadster with cutting-edge technology. And there’s one thing the two particularly have in common: they are always keen to cause a stir. BMW brought them together in Coachella Valley near Palm Springs in Southern California: the young, up-and-coming photographer and the two-seater convertible that has now thrilled fans of open-top driving for several months. The photo shoot in the Southern Californian desert was the first official stage of a long-term collaboration which aims to tap into new perspectives on current BMW models. Already attracting a growing international fan community, Brooklyn Beckham captures his motifs authentically through the eyes of the young generation, in the individual style of a constantly inquisitive, ambitious artist with an enthusiasm for automobiles.For Beckham, the upcoming BMW projects present a welcome opportunity to demonstrate his capabilities in an additional field of photography, while at the same time enabling him to explore his own fascination with sports-style cars. The first encounter between Beckham and the BMW brand was itself a noteworthy occasion. The young photographer visited the BMW Group Design Studio last summer and was able to take some initial shots of the BMW Concept Z4. Together with the design team he also modified his own personal vehicle. There is no doubt about it – the new BMW Z4 definitely struck a nerve with Brooklyn Beckham: “cool and dangerous” were the words he used to describe it – and “the most mind-blowing car I've ever seen.”A few months later, the unconventional artist and the distinctive model came together again for the first project as part of the collaboration with BMW. The assignment was likewise unique: Brooklyn Beckham was to use the shoot not only to portray the BMW Z4 but himself as well. He set to work in December with his favourite camera, a Hasselblad 503 – the young photo designer’s constant travel companion. The time of year would have been daunting for an outdoor shoot schedule in Central Europe – but in the Californian desert, with an average temperature of 21 degrees and at least five hours of sunlight per day, it was a sheer pleasure to work outdoors. Beckham: “The lighting conditions were fantastic.”This is hardly surprising: even in California, Coachella is known as the “City of Eternal Sunshine”. It is also where the private race track Thermal Club is located, its asphalt trail winding its way through the desert landscape like a grey river – the perfect setting for the kind of creative process Beckham thrives on. Dressed in T-shirt and chinos, the photographer circled his subject from all sides, studiously set his sights on details of the vehicle and the surrounding landscape and portrayed himself and the BMW Z4 using the cable release – as well as skateboarding around the roadster and on the race track. Each picture speaks volumes about the amount of fun he had on the job.“I take a photo whenever I see anything interesting.” Brooklyn Beckham’s description of his approach may be simple and modest, but he goes about his work with enormous diligence and expertise. This is reflected in the pictures he took in Coachella, too: they give the BMW Z4 a very distinctive presence against the contrasting effects of the soft Californian winter sunlight, the pastel shades of the surroundings and the bleak background of the rugged landscape.And this is precisely where the collaboration between BMW and Brooklyn Beckham is due to continue: another photo shoot has already been planned to coincide with the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival – a longstanding a cultural highlight in Southern California. BMW i is the official festival partner, and the young photographer already has a fixed date with the BMW i8 Roadster designed especially for the occasion. Fans can look forward to the angles, light and colours Beckham will use to portray the open-top plug-hybrid sports car.The photographer:Starting out in the world of photography, undertaking his own shoots while interning for established names such as Nick Knight he currently has some 12 million followers on Instagram.The model:The BMW Z4 was first launched in 2002, the third model generation has been on the market since the end of 2018. Powerful 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder in-line engines make the two-seater an open-top sports car. The modern interpretation of the roadster features a classic soft top as well as cutting-edge technology in the areas of operation and connectivity.More impressions:https:\/\/www.bmw.com\/en\/automotive-life\/brooklyn-beckham-car-photography.html The figures for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and power consumption are calculated based on the measurement methods stipulated in the current version of Regulation (EU) 2007\/715.

Team-mate Markus Reiterberger retired from the Superpole race due to a technical issue and crossed the line 15th in the afternoon’s race. It was a successful start to Sunday, with Sykes claiming second place in warm-up and Reiterberger in fifth. In the following Superpole race, Sykes repeated his performance from Saturday’s race one to claim a top-five place. Reiterberger was forced to retire with an issue with the primary gear. Sykes was in fifth place with his RR on the starting grid for race two, while Reiterberger began the race from 11th position. Sykes was able to defend his position before taking a wide line through one turn and slipping back a few places. The British rider lost more ground towards the mid-point of the race before crossing the line in 12th place. Reiterberger also had a difficult time, finishing in 15th place. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK team now moves to Assen in the Netherlands, where the fourth round of the 2019 WorldSBK season takes place this coming weekend . Quotes after race two at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Overall, we feel that we had a very good weekend that unfortunately ended in a disappointing way. We are pleased, but of course it’s a shame that we had such a tough final race after the good results in the first main race, and in the Superpole race. Both riders told us that the tyres had very little grip, but that alone cannot be the reason. Markus had a few problems with the electronics in the second race. We would have liked to have carried the positive feelings into the next race, but we will just try and forget about it and pick up where we left off in the Superpole Race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We had a very good Superpole yesterday which set us up for the weekend. We obviously then started today’s Superpole race in a good situation. Tom fought really well; Markus had a technical issue which sadly put him out and had to start from 11th in today’s main race. But Tom had a strong Superpole Race; he battled through. We can obviously see where the deficiencies are with the bike but I think overall it has been a promising weekend and we’ve made some good steps forward. Clearly, the main race was difficult for us to watch. Markus again had a technical issue and Tom was really struggling with grip. Once he was in a group of riders, he was clearly faster in the corners but slower on the straights and he was always in a difficult situation. It was a long race for him and one by one he got picked of. Eventually he brought the bike home with points. Not where we wanted to be but two strong races out of three has not been too bad this weekend.” Tom Sykes: “Honestly, it has been a very positive weekend for the entire BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. I honestly feel that we have again made some steps forward. I am very impressed and also there have been a lot of people inside the racing paddock who have commented on the potential of the BMW S 1000 RR, so I think we are heading in the right direction and are definitely making good progress. Again – to repeat myself – considering the limited amount of track time we have had, I think it’s even more impressive than our expectation. Everything was good, we were top five in most of the sessions, we almost – with the exception of my mistake in Superpole – almost showed an incredible potential speed. And then in the final race, it’s not a big problem, just if I am being blunt, we did not have the correct rear traction, which is a shame because the bike did not change and on the same tyre I was so fast during the race weekend. So with my honest opinion and with my experience I certainly feel we perhaps did not have a tyre that was to its full potential. It made my race very difficult and longer than anticipated and it’s a shame as our speed was certainly good enough to be inside the top five or top four again. So it was a bit of a disappointment on a great weekend but this is part of racing. Sometimes these things happen and we will be making up for this moving forward.” Markus Reiterberger: “After my fall yesterday, I was not sure how I would feel, but I was back to normal this morning and the medical check gave me the green light. I felt great during warm-up and I managed to produce eight to ten really fast laps. That meant that I was ready for the race. We changed the ratio a bit for the Superpole race as the wind was so strong, so we were expecting some slipstream duels. It didn’t feel so bad during the early laps, however, I suddenly got a warning in the cockpit and also heard some noises and had to park up the bike. That was annoying, as it meant starting the second race from 11th place. I made a normal start but once again it was another rider who knocked my handlebar - this time it was Michael van der Mark. I was just about able to stop myself from falling again. I recovered from that but then I had two massive highsiders that I was just about able to deal with. Something was not quite right and I think, but am not sure, that it could have been a problem with the tyres. In any case, it proved impossible to ride it out and I just wanted to get over the line for the points. Now we will analyse what the problem was, carry on working and start afresh at Assen.” \n"}

Unfortunately, his team-mate Markus Reiterberger (GER) was forced to retire after an accident at the start.

Sykes claimed third position on his RR to secure a front-row start, while Reiterberger’s seventh place also was his best Superpole result yet this season. Sykes moved up into second place right after the start of the race. He then fell back to eighth as the race continued, but improved by two places during a strong ride in the closing stage and started the final lap in sixth position. One of his competitors fell on that final lap, meaning that Sykes crossed the line in fifth place. Reiterberger, however, endured some bad luck as he collided with another rider immediately after the start. He was unable to continue the race after the incident. Quotes after race one at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Of course, we were really pleased with Superpole in the morning. We had given an indication of our strength in the free practice sessions which was confirmed when we claimed third and seventh places in qualifying. It was great to be on the front row for the first time this season and Tom made a very good start to the race. He struggled somewhat for a few laps during the early phase but he battled back really well at the end. He enjoyed a bit of luck to finish fifth, but he would have secured sixth place on his own merits. We are very pleased. It is clear for all to see that everything we do represents a step forward, even it if is just a small one. Unfortunately, Markus did not have a good start and being hit by another rider caused him to fall. He’s a bit battered and bruised but we are hopeful that he will recover overnight. He had already shown good race pace and I hope he can demonstrate that tomorrow.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Today has been a great step forward for the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and I think for sure Tom has shown now that we have made a significant step forward. Superpole was really exciting. To be on the front row despite going wide in the final corner was fantastic for Tom and the team. In the race, Markus unfortunately had a racing incident, a 50\/50 incident, and he was very lucky to escape unharmed. Tom had taken the decision to go with the SC1 rear compound tyre, which is a bit harder. We knew it would be difficult to manage at the beginning of the race but would come stronger at the end of the race. For that reason I think he fully deserves the fifth position. It was a good step forward for him and hopefully we can do the same tomorrow.” Tom Sykes: “I think for how early we are in the project, the programme only started a few months ago, it is really impressive what the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team has achieved so far. We’ve made small changes to the bike, of course now we are playing a bit with the electronics, but I think the biggest difference to the previous rounds is that we have a lot more corners here, and I think it’s clear to see that we are consistent in the first sectors and we are only losing out in the last sector. In Superpole, I was a bit angry with myself going wide on the last corner as it could have been pole position but the target was front row and then top five for the race and we have achieved that. On the grid, as the temperatures were quite cool, I opted for the harder rear tyre. It wasn’t too bad but after a few laps I could see that the sun would come out and temperatures rose but I enjoyed the race. I was battling with some guys who were on the softer tyre but the RR chassis is certainly working really well. I am enjoying riding the BMW S 1000 RR and I’m quite satisfied. It was my decision on the tyre and I just got caught out a bit with the rising temperature, but we definitely got some good information for tomorrow. I’m really excited about what’s to come during the season and for now I still think we can make a better race tomorrow.” Markus Reiterberger: “Superpole went well. We were improving all the time in practice and had developed a good feel for the bike. We took another step in the right direction in Superpole. I didn’t do quite so well on race tyres but in qualifying I did improve by a second. We were happy enough with seventh place, especially when you consider that I was just two tenths of a second away from third. We showed that we can compete on a fast lap. Unfortunately, I had a bad start, I stood a bit in a wrong position and then things happened very fast. Jonathan Rea hit me from the side, which meant that I lost control of the handlebar and took a tumble. It’s a shame about the race, as it would have been interesting to see where we could have finished.” \n"}

From the BMW Group’s point of view, this situation cannot be compared with cartel investigations involving territorial and price agreements, for example. Fundamentally, the participating engineers from the manufacturers’ development departments were concerned with improving exhaust gas treatment technologies.Unlike cartel agreements, the whole industry was aware of these discussions – which did not involve any “secret agreements” and did not intend any detriment to customers or suppliers. Optimisation of filling station infrastructure as requirement for smaller and lighter AdBlue tanksBased on current knowledge, a focus of the European Commission’s proceedings is the allegation that manufacturers reached an agreement on the size of AdBlue tanks for SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction)-systems. This is said to have restricted competition for the best emission control method for diesel vehicles.The fact remains that German automobile manufacturers jointly developed the first generation of an SCR system together with an automotive supplier. This cooperation on SCR development resulted in effective exhaust gas treatment systems rapidly achieving series maturity. A further goal of the manufacturers was the establishment of an extensive, customer-friendly AdBlue filling infrastructure over the long term as a pre-condition for the installation of smaller and lighter tanks. Manufacturers and automotive industry associations held talks with the petroleum industry regarding this matter. The working groups did indeed discuss the introduction of smaller AdBlue tanks, subject to availability of an adequate filling infrastructure. This was explained in public, for example by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) at a “Diesel Emissions Conference” in June 2009 in Brussels. However, as it became apparent that this infrastructure would not be available quickly enough, the BMW Group ultimately installed larger AdBlue tanks. Compromising emission control efficiency for the sake of optimising tank size was never an option for the BMW Group. BMW Group exhaust gas treatment technologies different from other manufacturers’The exhaust gas treatment technologies used by the BMW Group are significantly different from other solutions in the marketplace. The BMW Group has charted its own course from the beginning, using a combination of several emission control systems in its diesel vehicles. In vehicles where emission control is performed by SCR systems, a NOx storage catalyst is also installed. This results in excellent emissions performance in real driving conditions – also in comparison with competitors. The combination of these two systems in conjunction with in-engine exhaust gas recirculation also means that BMW vehicles’ AdBlue consumption is very low compared with competitors. Talks motivated by desire to ensure competition for best solutionThe European Commission further alleges that the companies concerned agreed not to introduce the petrol particulate filter (PPF) or to delay its introduction – thereby restricting competition for the best technology to reduce particulate matter. It should be noted that the discussions between manufacturers were directly linked to lawmakers’ deliberations at that time regarding the introduction of limits for particulate matter. The aim of the manufacturers and their associations was to participate in the discussion concerning the definition of future, technically achievable limits. This is usual practice in all industries regarding upcoming regulatory proposals. In order to achieve an industry position on the proposed legislation, the manufacturers first reached agreement among themselves and then via the VDA and ACEA automobile associations. The results of the discussions were incorporated into the consultations held by the Commission. The focus was on promoting legislation that was technologically neutral and did not necessarily require installation of a PPF. This would maintain technological freedom of choice for how to comply with limits – for example, through the use of in-engine measures. The background to this position was that PPF technology at that time had many disadvantages over in-engine measures: it was not yet fully mature and was associated with additional weight and a corresponding impact on CO2 emissions. At the time, there was also a negative effect on engine performance. The aim of ensuring technological freedom of choice in this case was precisely to achieve the most open and intense competition possible for the best solution. No evidence of agreements on use of unlawful defeat devicesThe BMW Group attaches great importance to the findings confirmed by the European Commission in its press release of 18 September 2018 that the ongoing investigations concern only potential violations of competition law and not deliberate unlawful manipulation of the emission control system. There is no allegation of this kind against the BMW Group. The BMW Group is committed to responsible and lawful conduct as the basis for all its business activities. The company has established a comprehensive compliance management system to ensure compliance with applicable legislation, including the provisions of antitrust law. \n"}

After the first six races, António Félix da Costa (POR) leads the driver standings and Alexander Sims (GBR) has also shown his strong pace in his maiden season. In a double interview, the BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers talk about the season so far.António, Alexander, how would you sum up the season so far ahead of the first race in Europe?António Félix da Costa: “With one win, three podiums and first place in the drivers’ standings, we had a really strong first half of the season. Since it became clear that BMW i Motorsport would be entering Formula E as a works team, I worked hard to be ready for Season 5. Now, seeing BMW i Andretti Motorsport as one of the top teams, is great validation for me – and great motivation to keep working just as hard.”Alexander Sims: “In the races to date, we have consistently shown great potential. We weren’t always able to get the results, for a variety of reasons, which we have analysed so that we can do better in the second half of the season. The BMW iFE.18’s performance gives us optimism for the coming races.”What have been the highlights so far, and what disappointments have you experienced?Félix da Costa: “My best day of the season was the first one: pole position and the win on BMW i Andretti Motorsport’s debut in Ad Diriyah were incredible. I was delighted to be able to give the team that success. Unfortunately, the outcome of the race in Marrakech was disappointing, when a perfect day suddenly went completely the other way eight minutes before the end.”Sims: “Definitely, the worst moment was the unfortunate end to the race in Marrakech. I haven’t had a clear best moment yet personally this season, but there have been many that have shown me that I can be fast in Formula E. It was fantastic to see António win the opening race in Ad Diriyah. That gave the whole team a major boost.”How did you deal with the incident in Marrakech within the team, and what did you learn from it?Sims: “The first thing that has to be said is that the incident, as disappointing as it was on the track, brought us even closer together as a team. Looking back, many things that went wrong came together in that moment. We spoke about the incident openly and honestly afterwards, and have learned our lessons from it.”Félix da Costa: “Alexander is right. In retrospect, the day made the team incredibly close. The way we handled the situation proved that we are a family. I’m really proud of that.”How do you feel the BMW i drivetrain measures up to the competition?Félix da Costa: “The BMW i engineers have done a fantastic job. Our drivetrain is fast and efficient – simply put, we have a really good package at our disposal; that’s despite it being the first time that BMW i engineers have developed a drivetrain for racing rather than production. It presented them with totally new challenges. Hats off to their achievement.”Sims: “Our drivetrain really is very efficient. We can tell because we always do best in races where saving as much energy as possible makes the difference. That’s extremely important in Formula E.”Where can you make further improvements?Sims: “I consistently see that I have the speed to be up there at the front but Formula E is so complex that as a driver you have to get the maximum out of every session to ultimately bring home the results. You also have to adjust your driving style very quickly from pure performance in qualifying to efficiency in the race. I’m working on these aspects. It’s really helping to have an experienced man such as António at my side.”Félix da Costa: “I see the biggest potential off track. We are getting to know each other as a team better all the time, and are working together better all the time too, but of course there is always room for improvement. I want to help as best I can, because I am proud of the whole team.”How closely do you work with your engineers – is it more than in other race series?Sims: “The little time that you have available on a race day in Formula E is the greatest limiting factor which means you have less opportunity to exchange information with the engineers. We try to offset this with intensive preparation for race day – including using the simulator.” Félix da Costa: “The technology in Formula E is unbelievably complex. It’s always about finding the perfect compromise between speed and efficiency which is not all that easy and can’t be mastered by me as a driver alone. I need the close collaboration with my engineers for that.” Are you in contact with the BMW i engineers in Munich during the season?Félix da Costa: “The communication with the BMW i engineers was intensive primarily during the testing phase. I thought it was great to collaborate with people from outside the world of racing. During the season they work hard in the background to improve our drivetrain from race to race.”Sims: “We had the chance to visit the BMW i engineers in Munich. It was incredibly interesting. They even gave us a first look at Season 6. Their work is the key to our success.”\n"}

On most of the track we certainly have the chassis to do what’s needed. The only question from the previous experiences is our performance down the very long back straight. It’s obviously still a bit of an unknown but I feel that the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is doing a great job considering we still have to do a lot of testing during the actual race weekends. My expectations are that we will be continuing this way, enjoy our racing and for sure the rest will come naturally in the not too distant future.” Markus Reiterberger: “I am glad that we are back in Europe. Aragón is a great track that I like very much. Certainly it is a bit easier for me because I’ve raced there many times. Last year I got along really well and rode very fast times with the Superstock bike. With my qualifying time, I would have even been in the top eight for the Superbikes. I hope the weather is good and it is not too windy. I also hope that we can take another step forward in my set-up so that I get a better feeling for the front; then a good weekend is possible. My crew chief and the whole team have intensively analysed and worked through the findings from Buriram, and I know that BMW will bring some things to Spain. It is important to work well all weekend, to constantly improve, to give good feedback and to pull together. I hope we can make it into the top ten and that I can reward my team for the hard work.” \n"}

Art Basel and BMW are delighted to present the 2019 artist shortlist for the BMW Art Journey, a joint initiative recognizing and supporting emerging artists worldwide. Like a mobile studio, the BMW Art Journey can take artists almost anywhere in the world to develop new ideas and envision new creative projects.Today, an international expert jury announced the following shortlist of three artists showing in Discoveries, the sector for emerging artists, at Art Basel in Hong Kong:Clarissa Tossinat Commonwealth and Council, Los AngelesClarissa Tossin (b. 1973) lives and works in Los Angeles, United States. She received her Master of Fine Arts from the California Institute of the Arts. In her artistic practice, Tossin uses installation, video, performance, sculpture, and photography. For this year’s edition of Art Basel in Hong Kong, Tossin is pairing DIY plastic recycling techniques with the materials and practices of Amazonian aesthetic traditions, highlighting the contemporary footprint left in the geological sedimentation of the earth. The artist has had exhibitions at Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, Cambridge and Sicardi Gallery, Houston. Her work was also included in group shows at Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and Hammer Museum, Los Angeles.Lu Yang at Société, BerlinLu Yang (b. 1984) is a Shanghai-based multi-media artist, who graduated from the New Media Art Department of the China Academy of Art. Deeply immersed in the subcultures of anime, video games, and Science-Fiction, the output of her artistic practice spans 3D-animated films, video game-like installations, holograms, neon, VR and software manipulation, often with overt Japanese manga and anime references. For Art Basel in Hong Kong, Lu Yang has created unique fantasies highlighting the fragility of humankind. Departing from Buddhist teachings that propagate a genderless society, she exploits her own images as a vehicle to reproduce asexual visions of herself. Her work was displayed in exhibitions at Centre Pompidou, Paris; M Woods, Beijing; Shanghai Biennale; and Athens Biennale.Shen Xin at Madeln Gallery, ShanghaiShen Xin (b. 1990) lives and works in London, United Kingdom, and Amsterdam, Netherlands. She received her Master of Fine Arts in Media at The Slade School of Fine Arts of the University College London. Through films and video installations, as well as performative events, Shen Xin’s practice examines and fabricates techniques and effects of how emotion, judgment and ethic circulate through individual and collective subjects. At this year’s edition of Art Basel in Hong Kong, the artist presents “Commerce des Esprits”, a four-channel video installation bringing the perspectives and productivities of comparative philosophy into an event which narrates an unconscious state. Recent solo exhibitions include K11 Art Foundation, Shanghai, and Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art, Manchester. Her work has been on display at group exhibitions including OCAT Shanghai; and Julia Stoschek Collection, Dusseldorf. These three shortlisted artists are now invited to develop a proposal for their ideal journey, with the winner to be announced in the early summer of 2019.The members of the expert jury in Hong Kong are:Claire Hsu, Director Asia Art Archive, Hong KongMatthias Mühling, Director Städtische Galerie im Lenbachhaus, MunichPatrizia Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, President Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo, TurinPhilip Tinari, Director Ullens Center for Contemporary Art (UCCA), BeijingSamson Young, artist and winner of the first BMW Art Journey“We had a very diverse group of artists who encompass a variety of media,” noted the jury in making its unanimous decision. “All of them engage important issues and are operating in contexts or in stages of their careers that will allow them to benefit from this incredible opportunity. We believe that the three selected artists have great potential to conceive a journey that will positively impact their research, their work, and their professional growth. Shen Xin has distinguished herself with expansive, curious, poetic works that generally take the form of complex, multi-channel video narratives. She explores contemporary subjectivities by delving into histories, philosophies, and psychologies as embedded in different cultures, genders, and other identities. Her research-intensive, project-based way of working struck the jury as particularly suited to the nature of the Art Journey. Lu Yang is a Shanghai based artists who creates frenetic multimedia installations. Her works combine images with references from religion, manga, anime or pop culture. Her fast moving colorful images show both entertaining and deeply intellectual visions of our contemporary culture. At a time when we are facing the extinction of animals and plants on a daily basis, Clarissa Tossin asks us to reflect on the future of our planet and humanity by drawing on traditional weaving processes from the Amazon region and mass produced materials. Both true alluring and beautiful, her works also conjures a future unknown – both apocalyptic and utopian – and asks us to imagine what imprint our current mass consumption will have on future generations”, states the jury.In collaboration with the winning artist, the journey will be documented and shared with the public through publications, online and social media.Past winners of the BMW Art Journey include sound and performance artist Samson Young (presented by a.m. Space, Hong Kong at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2015); German video artists Henning Fehr and Philipp Rühr (presented by Galerie Max Mayer, Dusseldorf at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2015); British artist Abigail Reynolds (presented by Rokeby, London at Art Basel's show in Hong Kong in 2016) as well as Max Hooper Schneider (presented by High Art, Paris at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2016), Astha Butail (represented by GALLERYSKE, New Dehli, Bangalore at Art Basel´s Hong Kong show in 2017), Jamal Cyrus (represented by Inman Gallery, Houston at Art Basel’s Miami Beach show in 2017) and Zac Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland at Art Basel’s Hong Kong show in 2018).Launched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging artists worldwide. This unique award is open to artists who are exhibiting in the Discoveries sector during Art Basel in Hong Kong. A judging panel comprised of internationally renowned experts meet first to select a shortlist of three artists from the sector, who are then invited to submit proposals for a journey aimed to further develop their ideas and artistic work. The jury reconvenes to choose a winner from the three proposals. For further information on the BMW Art Journey please visit: bmw-art-journey.com.During this year’s Art Basel show in Hong Kong the latest awardee Zac Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland) will be on the ground in Hong Kong for the documentation of his BMW Art Journey project “Sutures of the Sky”. His journey took him across a world that humans and birds have been navigating through millennia. He followed the flight paths of birds like the white stork or the arctic tern, traveling along the earth’s axis where the Northern and Southern Hemispheres’ summers intersect. Migrating birds cover some of the longest distances traveled by any living being. Their routes have guided the Polynesian pathfinders across the seas. Inspired by this ancient celestial tracing, Langdon-Pole's journey questions the position of humans as the center of the world. Weaving through Central Europe, Southern Africa, and the Pacific Islands of Samoa and Hawaii, his BMW Art Journey seeks to understand how culture intersects with the science of celestial mapping – and from there flows into larger existential inquiries about who we are and how we are situated in the world.Furthermore, the world’s first BMW Art Car (BMW 3.0 CSL, 1975), created by legendary artist Alexander Calder, will be presented in the BMW Lounge at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.BMW has supported Art Basel’s shows in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong Kong as a long-term partner for many years.\n"}

His team-mate Alexander Sims (GBR) was also among the frontrunners, but retired after an accident. Starting from third (Félix da Costa) and fifth (Sims) on the grid, the race was characterised mainly by energy management. After the frontrunners were racing defensively for more than half the race, leaving the field close together, the first duels began after around 30 minutes. In a head-to-head with André Lotterer (GER), Sims slid into the barriers, damaging his #27 BMW iFE.18 too severely to continue the race. After this incident, the BMW i8 Coupé Safety Car came onto the track, before the race was red flagged shortly afterwards. Félix da Costa defended his third place throughout the race, which ended behind the BMW i8 Coupé Safety Car after another accident in the middle of the field. With 62 points, Félix da Costa has now taken the lead in the driver standings. Sims still has 18 points to his name and is in 14th in the overall standings. In the team standings, BMW i Andretti Motorsport is in fifth with 80 points. As a result of numerous investigations after the race, the result is provisional. Reactions to the Sanya E-Prix: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“Third place for António is a very good result. We had both cars in the Super Pole and overall put in a strong performance. In Sanya the power train plays a big role – and we were in a great position here with the BMW i drivetrain. Both drivers were fantastic in qualifying. However, the race ended up being a disappointment for Alexander. He had a good rhythm before he retired after being involved in a duel with another car. Despite everything going on around him, António kept a cool head. He drove very sensibly and picked up a lot of valuable points for the team. We’re pleased.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 3rd place, race result: 3rd place, FANBOOST voting: 3rd place, points: 62):“It goes without saying I am pleased with the result, the points and the lead in the driver standings. But I’m a little frustrated too, if I’m being honest, because I wanted to do even better today. I was able to keep up with the two guys in front of me with no problems and think that I could have won. But the track here is very narrow and you have to take a lot of risks to overtake. I tried once, but then decided to take the important points for third place. I think this is the way we need to act if we want to stay at the top until the end of the season.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 6th place, race result: retired, FANBOOST voting: 13th place, points: 18)“It’s difficult to accept this disappointing end to the race. Our pace was good and qualifying went really well as well. António is a superb benchmark for me, so I was delighted to be able to keep up with his lap times. Then the race went okay. It was difficult to overtake. Then the racing started. I defended my line against Lotterer, and I feel he didn’t leave me enough space. It’s a real shame that our pace and efforts went unrewarded.” The BMW i FleetBMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 5.

Between 22 - 31 March Tate Modern stages its third annual BMW Tate Live Exhibition in the atmospheric subterranean Tanks. Anne Imhof’s dynamic installation \"Sex\" is the first project by a solo artist to occupy the full suite of spaces in the Tanks. Anne Imhof is one of the most pioneering contemporary artists of her generation, awarded in 2015 with the Preis der Nationalgalerie, a long-term partner of BMW, and winner of the prestigious Golden Lion at Venice Biennale in 2017.The commission is both an exhibition by day and a series of six live performances by night. Titled \"Sex\", the work deals with fluidity between binaries – female and male, top and bottom, night and day – and the blurred line where two opposing zones meet. Structural interventions splice through each of the grand spaces. In the South Tank, visitors walk into the space on a raised platform, a scenario mirrored in the East Tank where the hierarchy of viewing is reversed and visitors are situated on the ground beneath a pier. The adjacent Transformer galleries display a collection of Imhof’s Gradient and Scratch paintings, alongside elements of sculpture that intervene in the architecture.Since 2012, Imhof has worked with a core group of collaborators from diverse backgrounds to make her durational performances. During six remarkable evenings at Tate Modern, they will inhabit the space while interacting with each other and engaging with situations and objects that serve as settings for their characters. Imhof doesn’t appear in the work herself but is present, orchestrating the work and sending notes and directions to her collaborators. Power dynamics between performer and viewer are also a key component of \"Sex\". Viewing positions alternate between high and low, shifting perspectives on the live tableaux. Performers also occupy an inaccessible zone behind a glass partition in the East Tank, onto which they paint. Although the structure and score of the live work is carefully developed by Imhof, what happens within the four-hour duration is dependent on the individuality and agency of the performers, making each staging unique and unrepeatable.Graeme Grieve, Chief Executive Officer, BMW Group UK and Ireland, said: \"Through our partnership with Tate Modern, BMW Tate Live has developed into an innovative exhibition format which attracts the world’s leading performance artists to London. We are delighted that Anne Imhof will stage her exciting programme in the Tanks space in March and look forward to another successful exhibition.\"Anne Imhof is renowned for staging complex performative projects over long periods of time, such as \"Faust\", an intense and engaging installation created for the German pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017. The artist divided the interior with glass partitions and floors inhabited by a choreographed group of performers. Other recent projects have included \"Angst\", presented in three acts at Kunsthalle Basel, Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin, and the Biennale de Montréal in 2016.This year’s exhibition follows the success of the first two BMW Tate Live Exhibitions in 2017 and 2018. These groundbreaking programs pioneered a new model for the exhibition format with an ever-changing series of installations and live performances across ten days. Taking place in the Tanks, the world’s first museum spaces dedicated to performance, film and installation, the BMW Tate Live Exhibitions have showcased a wide range of artists including Joan Jonas, Fujiko Nakaya, Isabel Lewis, Jason Moran, Mark Leckey, Jumana Emil Abboud, Wu Tsang and Fred Moten.BMW Tate Live Exhibition is curated by Catherine Wood, Isabella Maidment and produced by Judith Bowdler.\"Sex\" is the first of three chapters in a project commissioned by Tate Modern, London, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Castello di Rivoli Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Rivoli-Turin.About BMW Tate LiveBMW Tate Live is a major international partnership between BMW and Tate, which aims to foreground the pivotal role of live experimentation in art history and among artists working today. The programme has now showcased over 50 artists including both emerging and more familiar figures from across the world. It began in 2012 with the world’s first performance programme created for live online broadcast, and evolved into an ongoing series of performances at Tate Modern.

BMW i and Formula E’s shared journey got underway with the very first race in Beijing back in 2014, meaning we have come full circle with our return as the BMW i Andretti Motorsport works team. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to make the best of our opportunities at the last event in Hong Kong. We’ve analysed the reasons and drawn our conclusions. In Sanya we hope to make better use of our BMW i drivetrain’s strengths once again and build on the top performances that have already brought us some brilliant results this season. Our goal is still to bring home as many points as possible with the BMW iFE.18.” Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“After the disappointment of the race in Hong Kong, the team is looking forward to moving on to Sanya. We analysed in detail why we weren’t as competitive as usual in Hong Kong and we are confident that we will have a strong package again for the future. We don’t know all that much about the area in which we will be driving in China, but we are doing tests in the simulator, so we’ll be well prepared. We can’t wait to get racing again and to pick up some well-needed points for the overall standings.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18):“I am really looking forward to our debut in Sanya. The track appears to be relatively fast and extensive at first glance, with long straights and hard braking zones. After we were unfortunately unable to make use of our package’s strengths in Hong Kong, I hope that we will return to our usual form in Sanya.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18):“We will all be experiencing a new track in Sanya, so everyone is starting from scratch. I’ve already completed a few laps of the track layout in the simulator – it seems like it will be fun.

For the two riders, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Markus Reiterberger (GER), warm-up, Superpole Race and race two were on the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) programme. They completed more kilometres under race conditions to gain further experience for the development of the new Superbike. In the end, Reiterberger finished race two in eleventh place, while Sykes had to retire due to a technical problem.In the Superpole race on early Sunday afternoon Sykes took the flag in tenth position while Reiterberger finished 14th. Sykes was therefore tenth on the grid for race two, held in the late afternoon local time, while Reiterberger started from 12th place. Both BMW riders made up positions at the start. As the race went on, Sykes was in ninth place but then experienced issues with the clutch and had to stop his bike at the side of the track. Reiterberger collected five more world championship points by finishing in 11th position. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and WorldSBK will now return to Europe. The third round of the season will be held from 5th to 7th April at MotorLand Aragón near Alcañiz (ESP). Quotes after race two at Buriram. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The grid positions after the Superpole race met our expectations and were okay. The second main race, however, was rather disappointing for us, with Tom retiring and Markus having quite a gap to the front. Tom had to stop due to a slipping clutch. We will now analyse in detail what caused it. Markus was able to collect a few points by finishing 11th. Now we need to take advantage of the short break to complete the next updates at the factory, taking the next steps on our way forward.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Tom had a great Superpole race. Again, we were focusing on the top ten positions. He got a really good start, got pushed wide a little bit on turn one but worked his way through. By the time he was in turn three, he was in a strong position. He settled in with a good routine and got a strong finish. Tom’s main race unfortunately suddenly came to a close. He had settled into a good rhythm, the track was just coming to him, the lap times had started to drop but then unfortunately he had a technical issue that dropped him out. Markus really struggled today finding a comfortable bike, which has been a problem all weekend. He could not find a good feeling with the chassis, especially with the front end. Until we can give him that real comfortable feel he’s struggling to really push to close the gap towards the front guys. We have to be happy still overall for the weekend in Buriram - disappointing with the DNF for Tom - but I think we still go away with a lot of positives and are looking forward to Aragón.” Tom Sykes: “After a couple of laps I felt that something was wrong. It’s a bit frustrating because we had made a change to the bike and it really felt good. On the positive side I’m really surprised to come here to this race circuit and to be inside the top ten with our disadvantage on the straight, so to be inside the top ten is really promising in my opinion. Honestly, in the approach and entry of many corners, the chassis and the set-up on the BMW S 1000 RR is really an advantage compared to our competition so overall there are quite a lot of positives for me to take. The negative is obviously, as we saw at Phillip Island, that we are giving a lot away on the straights but hopefully that won’t be a problem anymore in the not so distant future.” Markus Reiterberger: “In the Superpole race, I had a great start and was right behind Tom after the first corner. I also had nice battles on the opening laps, but then another rider almost got me off the bike and I had to go straight. As a result, I lost six positions. When I then made a mistake, the race was more or less over for me. In the main race I struggled with the issue that has been causing us difficulties all weekend: that I could not delay the bike well enough and I had no feeling for the front of the bike. We tried to get a grip on that and improved things step by step, but unfortunately it just was not enough over the distance, especially when it got hotter and the grip level went down. Our gap towards the front mainly results from the time lost on the straights, but I’m not worried about that. Here I trust the guys in the factory that we get more power, and then the results will be better as well. But I have to continue to work on getting confidence in the front wheel when turning in and in the corners.” \n"}

After more than 40 minutes the Florida GT marathon went green in wet conditions. Both BMW M8 GTEs quickly formed part of the GTLM field top group and were involved in some good fights with other cars. Ultimately the two BMW crews had to make do with fourth and seventh. The #911 Porsche secured victory. Turner Motorsport raced in the GTD category with the #96 BMW M6 GT3. Bill Auberlen, Dillon Machavern and Robby Foley (all USA) were fighting for a podium over long stretches of the races, before being forced to retire with just 15 minutes to go due to a technical issue. It was Auberlen’s 26th start at the Sebring 12 Hours and the 413th start in his career as BMW driver. Reactions to the 12 Hours of Sebring. Jens Marquardt (BMW Motorsport Director): “Following Friday’s WEC thriller, this race was slightly more relaxed. Apart from rain in the opening stage, this year’s 12 Hours of Sebring saw no major incidents involving our two BMW M8 GTE cars, however this time BMW Team RLL wasn’t rewarded with a podium for their great efforts. Congratulations to Porsche on the victory. We had to make do with P4 and P7. More wasn’t possible today. Nevertheless, our sporting performance this weekend was very positive. The BMW M8 GTE left a strong impression when finishing second in WEC’s LM GTE Pro class. As was the case in Daytona, we were competitive again in the IMSA series, too. This makes us head into the next races anticipating more strong outcomes – in North America as well as in the World Championship. In any case, ‘Super Sebring’ was good for all of us. Twenty years after our overall win with the BMW V12 LMR we put on a good show again for the fans here at Sebring.” Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “It started out very well and the guys in the team all did a great job. It looked like it was going to rain more which would have been a good thing for us but in the end it didn’t. We, of course, wanted to do better but we just didn’t have the pace of the leaders. We go to Long Beach now and we’ll see what we can do there.” John Edwards (#24 BMW M8 GTE, fourth place): “I think it was clear pretty early on that we didn’t have a car to win so we focused on the podium, but even that was going to be tough. We had a slightly shorter fuel stint than our competitors so we had to save a lot and still try and push. It meant I had to lose a place to the Corvette and miss out on the podium. But, we got some points in the bag for the championship and, as we saw last year, you don’t need to win races to take the title.” Jesse Krohn (#24 BMW M8 GTE, fourth place): “It was a flawless race from the team, which did a really amazing job with strategy and keeping the car together. There was also a really strong performance from my team-mates in some very tough conditions. Today our competitors made it onto the podium but we did the best with what we had.”Philipp Eng (#24 BMW M8 GTE, fourth place): “A podium would have been nice after our hard work and strong performance. The whole team did a faultless job again today – we were good on strategy and I think we maximised what we had. It was cool to be in the #24 BMW M8 GTE and I hope we can get on the podium next time.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 BMW M8 GTE, seventh place): “We have some positives to take away and we learned a few things that I think will benefit us in the season. Overall, the guys worked hard during the weekend, so not to get on the podium was a little disappointing, but now we will move on to the next round at Long Beach.” Tom Blomqvist (#25 BMW M8 GTE, seventh place): “Obviously, it was not the race result we would have liked. That said, it was a good start with the wet conditions and we had a really strong pace. We managed to get into the lead for a little bit and we were one of the quickest fighting at the front, but for some reason we really struggled in the dry today.” Colton Herta (#25 BMW M8 GTE, seventh place): “It was a long but very exciting race. We fought hard and gave it our all. By the middle of the race we were looking okay but we just kept dropping back. For me, right now, its not about results but about learning and doing everything right.” \n"}

The ‘Chang International Circuit’ in Buriram, Thailand is the second track which sees the brand new BMW S 1000 RR in action in its FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) debut season. In Saturday’s race, both BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team riders finished in the points again: Tom Sykes (GBR) crossed the line in ninth while Markus Reiterberger (GER) took 14th place.Temperatures were already tropical for Superpole qualifying in the early afternoon, reaching 34 degrees Celsius. Sykes secured sixth place on the second row on his RR and Reiterberger finished Superpole in 11th. The race itself was held in the late afternoon local time. After 20 laps, Sykes claimed another top-ten finish with ninth position. Reiterberger also increased his points tally by taking 14th place. Quotes after race one at Buriram. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The results of the first race are inline with our expectations. We were able to confirm the success of our updates and sort out other issues. Now we are looking forward to tomorrow’s Superpole race. Given the current top-speed deficit however, it would still be unrealistic to expect that we can hold our grid positions in the races.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Tom had a real good Superpole. He started the session pretty slowly and did not quite get into his rhythm. Then he put the qualifying tyre on and really pulled it out of the bag to qualify in a very strong sixth position on the second row. Markus did not quite get the best out of his qualifying tyre but nevertheless he safely rode through onto a reasonable position on the grid. In the race, we knew where we would end up roughly within the field. The target was a top-ten position and I think, with the deficit in the straight-line speed, Tom did impressively and showed his professional approach to bring it home in the position he did. We got some valuable data and I am sure we can make some improvements overnight. Markus dropped back in the turmoil of the first corner after the start. He had difficult opening laps, lost positions, ran wide a couple of time when struggling on braking and so finished in 14th. Nevertheless we know what his issues are and we can rectify them overnight. All in all, I’m very happy with progress. Four race starts, four race finishes, no major problems and lots of data, and the guys are working very hard together.” Tom Sykes: “I think everyone saw today the potential of the BMW S 1000 RR. In the corners and in the braking areas, I think our potential is very high. It’s just a bit unfortunate that we are missing out on straight-line speed and so we were losing positions on the straight. I was very happy with the performance in the corners, the corner speed and the general turning of the bike. Again: the first time I rode this bike was on 18th December. It is a very early stage of the programme. I have a lot of experience and to just put things into perspective I think that we are doing a very, very good job. For now we have a limitation on speed performance but in the areas of chassis, suspension, electronics everybody did a great job already and honestly the handling of the bike is impressive. And even, considering the nature of the track, to do these lap times is promising for me, also considering what we are losing in the first two sectors. When I had battles on the track today I was actually surprised how strong we were in some areas. So we keep working!” Markus Reiterberger: “We’ve made a change from yesterday to today which we benefitted from in the third free practice as I was able to ride fast and consistent lap times. For the Superpole we then made another small adjustment which gave me even more confidence. I had a good start in the race, but then I was a bit unlucky in the first corner and on the back straight. Unfortunately I lost some positions. In the turmoil I could not ride my own rhythm. In addition, it seems that I could not quite brake as I would like to. Then I made a mistake and went wide but I was able to bring home two points, although of course our expectations are higher. But I honestly did not have an ideal feeling with the bike during the race. We will now continue to work on further getting to know, and improving, the whole package.” \n"}

In the sixth round of the WEC Super Season, BMW Team MTEK finished second and seventh in the LM GTE Pro class respectively with its two BMW M8 GTEs. It was the first podium finish for the team since WEC’s Fuji (JPN) round. After 226 laps and a dramatic finish with heavy rain, the #81 car crossed the line in second place. Martin Tomczyk (GER), Nick Catsburg (NED) and Alexander Sims (GBR), who celebrated his 31st birthday on Friday, had shared driving duties over the course of the race. Their team-mates Augusto Farfus (BRA), António Félix da Costa (POR) and Bruno Spengler (CAN) came seventh in the #82 sister car. Victory at Sebring was secured by the #91 Porsche. In an eventful first phase of the race, both BMW M8 GTE cars were able to improve their positions quickly. Farfus was leading the field at the end of his stint, after starting fourth on the grid. Car #81 took the lead for the first time with a good two hours to go. Only during a late pit stop in the rain did final-stint driver Catsburg drop to second place. Over the course of the race, the GTE class cars had been running closely together, with frequent position changes due to spectacular moves or differing pit stop strategies. On Saturday, the “BMW M Motorsport Super Weekend” will continue when round two of the IMSA series will be on the agenda for BMW Team RLL. Following the team’s win at Daytona (USA), the two BMW M8 GTE cars will start from sixth and seventh on the grid at Sebring. Reactions on the WEC race at Sebring. Jens Marquardt (BMW Motorsport Director):“What a thriller. This was an amazingly gripping race, with a dramatic finish in the rain over the final 20 minutes. In this finale we narrowly missed out on the victory, but managed to take a satisfying second place after a good fight. Obviously you want to make it onto the top-step of the podium after such a dramatic final phase, and of course it was a pity that the race finished behind the safety car. However, positive emotions dominate today due to the strong performance we delivered. Congratulations to Martin Tomczyk, Nick Catsburg and Alexander Sims – and to the whole team. Our second car was running strongly as well, even though it couldn’t fight for a podium. The Sebring fans were treated to some great fights; the GTE Pro class for sure delivered the best action in the field. The atmosphere here is great; it’s a unique event. Now we want to build on that and score another top result with BMW Team RLL on Saturday in the IMSA series.” Ernest Knoors (Team Principal, BMW Team MTEK):“It’s been a pleasure coming to Sebring. It’s an iconic track and you only know how special it is when you have experienced it. It’s been tough for our crew but they have been extremely good. The test was very hot for the boys and girls but they learned a lot and put it all to use this week. We had strong pace but we were struggling with tyre degradation. To be in a position where you can fight in the last hour was exactly what we needed to do and we did that today. It just didn’t go our way in the end. Compliments to Porsche for the win - it was a great battle.” Martin Tomczyk (#81 BMW M8 GTE, second place):“Obviously, it was a super-clean race from all three of us drivers so we were really happy with own performance. The car was in good shape, especially when it got dark. The rain helped us but not enough. It was close to us getting the first WEC victory but being on the podium is great for the team and for myself.” Nick Catsburg (#81 BMW M8 GTE, second place):“It feels great to finally be on the WEC podium. It was a crazy race – I just wish we could have held on to first place. The team did a flawless job. Let’s celebrate now.” Alexander Sims (#81 BMW M8 GTE, second place):“It was a pretty fun race! The car had good pace throughout the race and the team did a great job – they executed everything properly. The rain was exciting and Nicky did a great job to bring it home in P2.” António Félix da Costa (#82 BMW M8 GTE, seventh place):“It’s my first time at Sebring. It’s an amazing event but it’s a super hard track to learn in just a few days. As a team, we performed a lot better than ever before. We had a real shot at winning today but we double stinted the tyres and lost some time. I’m really happy for the #81 car to get their first podium and our second podium as a team.” Augusto Farfus (#82 BMW M8 GTE, seventh place):“It was a tough one, to be honest. I was pleased with my opening stint when the balance of the car felt great. However, we lost pace halfway through the race. We tried to make our way back up but it was just not possible. We got a lot of mileage and knowledge to take with us to Spa and Le Mans. It was a top job by the other crew and we’re delighted to see them on the podium.” Bruno Spengler (#82 BMW M8 GTE, seventh place):“It was a really good week and I was so happy to do my first WEC race. It was a new challenge for me and it was great to be back with my DTM team. I enjoyed it a lot even though it didn’t turn out the way we would have liked it.

Three weeks after its successful race debut at Phillip Island, Australia, the new BMW S 1000 RR is set for its second WorldSBK outing. This weekend , will be focussing on the continued development of the brand-new superbike under race conditions. The RR production version was launched in November 2018, and with the road bikes as a basis, BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had just three months to prepare the race bikes for the Superbike World Championship. The season-opener at Phillip Island produced the first good results, on which the team is now looking to build: Both riders finished within the points positions in both races. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’s race weekend kicks off with two free practice sessions on Friday. Saturday features Superpole qualifying and race one, which gets underway at 16:00 local time. The new ten-lap “Superpole Race”, which was introduced to WorldSBK this season, starts at 13:00 local time on Sunday. This is followed at 16:00 by race two. Quotes ahead of the Buriram races. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We have taken a lot of positive things from Australia, but we have also clearly seen in the races where we are still behind and which areas we need to focus on in terms of further development. Due to the short time between the two race weekends the fact that the equipment has not returned to the team headquarters between Australia and Thailand, we will only bring certain technical updates. These are aimed primarily at the reliability for the upcoming battle with the heat. We look forward to the next event where the atmosphere is always great, and we will be able to gather more important experience there on the way forward.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It’s going to be a very tough weekend for everyone with the temperatures soaring at 40 degrees Celsius, but we are confident we can continue the good work in Australia and bring some new ideas to the table to make another step forward for Buriram. The team has done some good work in-between Phillip Island and Buriram which we can implement here and hopefully improve our pace come the race, which is our main aim.” Tom Sykes: “It’s always great to come and race at the Buriram circuit here in Thailand. Obviously my main focus this weekend is still to continue the development of the new BMW S 1000 RR. I’m feeling really confident in some ways but given our experience in the race at Phillip Island one of my few concerns is the two long straights given the speed deficit. Despite that, the BMW S 1000 RR chassis is really good and is capable of taking on the rest of the field. I am looking forward to starting the race weekend and hope that we can continue the good progress made over the winter test period.” Markus Reiterberger: “I really like Thailand. Firstly, because my best result in the Superbike World Championship came there – fifth place in 2016. Secondly, because the track really suits my riding style. There are a lot of sections where you have to brake hard, which is my strength and something our new RR is also very good at. We just have to try not to lose too much on the long straights and then to make up in the corners what we are still currently losing on the straights. However, we are all working hard and I think that Thailand can be a good hunting ground for us. The heat will make it challenging for everyone, but we are well prepared and I believe we can have a good weekend. I am determined to do well and already looking forward to the weekend, as I really like the track and we found a positive trend at Phillip Island, which we will now carry into the race in Thailand.” \n"}

The team did, however, manage to pick up points again in the fifth race of the season, courtesy of tenth place for António Félix da Costa (POR). Alexander Sims (GBR) failed to finish the Hong Kong E-Prix (CHN) after damaging his BMW iFE.18 when he hit the crash barriers. ->","completion":" Repeated showers made qualifying a major challenge. With track conditions changing all the time, the pursuit of the best grid positions was something of a lottery at times. Sims and Félix da Costa ultimately had to settle for 13thand 20thplace. The race was neutralised several times after incidents and was suspended on one occasion allowing the BMW i8 Coupé Safety Car to make several appearances on track. While Sims dropped back as the result of a number of incidents, before eventually retiring, Félix da Costa was able to stay out of all the turmoil and steadily worked his way up through the field – thanks partly to FANBOOST. In the final laps, his fightback was rewarded with tenth place and one point towards the overall standings. Reactions to the Hong Kong E-Prix: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“That is not the result we were looking for in Hong Kong. We arrived here with high expectations. The circuit should actually have suited us and António has been extremely competitive here in the past. The conditions were very difficult and qualifying, when the track was wet at first, meant we were playing catch-up from therein. Qualifying is the key to success in Formula E. This weekend showed once again that it is difficult to get to the front if you start from the middle or back of the field. Alex got off to a great start and climbed five places. Unfortunately, he then made a mistake which saw him drop to the back of the field. He tried to work his way back into the race, but had to retire with a broken suspension after hitting the wall. António worked his way through the field, but then got stuck outside the top ten. We ultimately benefitted from retirements and managed to pick up a point. Every point helps, but that is definitely not what we wanted to achieve here.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 20thplace, race result: 10thplace, FANBOOST voting: 2ndplace, points: 47):“It was clear after qualifying that it was going to be difficult. Particularly at a circuit where there are hardly any overtaking opportunities. All the safety car periods meant that nobody needed to conserve energy and the pace of all the cars was virtually the same. It was almost impossible to make an overtaking manoeuvre. Having said that, we did manage to score a point. We must analyse why our pace was so poor in the wet, especially as it was okay in similar conditions in Ad Diriyah and at the test in Valencia. We must now concentrate fully on the next race in Sanya.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 13thplace, race result: DNF, FANBOOST voting: 14thplace, points: 18)“That was an up and down day. Some sessions were better than others. The pace was actually okay. In the race, I had a fantastic opening lap. I was aggressive but considered, which paid off. However, I then learned another lesson about Formula E: in this series, it is so easy to make a mistake in these cars, as they are difficult to drive at the limit. My front wheels locked under braking on lap two and I missed the corner. My race was over from that point on. I found myself at the back of the field again. I pushed and tested the limits, then I hit the wall and that was the end of my race. I will try to take the positives from this and to finally have a clean weekend. If I can do that, we will get the results that our work actually deserves.” The BMW i FleetBMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 5.

BMW M Motorsport heralded the critical phase of preparations for the 2019 DTM season with the first test of the year at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. The three-day test, from Tuesday to Thursday, saw BMW engineers continue their work on the BMW M4 DTM, which has been newly developed in accordance with Class 1 regulations. Timo Glock (GER) and Bruno Spengler (CAN) were the men behind the wheel. At the heart of BMW’s 2019 DTM season race car is the newly-developed, highly-efficient two-litre four-cylinder turbo engine, which generates over 600 hp. It continues the success story of BMW Turbo Power in motorsport which began in 1969, exactly 50 years ago. Many areas of the BMW M4 DTM have been redesigned for the new turbo engine, including the exhaust system, front end and cooling vents. Changes were also made to the front splitter and rear wing, while the rear diffusor was lowered. The next test is scheduled for 15th to 18th April at the Lausitzring (GER). All six BMW DTM drivers will be in action at this official ITR test. The season-opener takes place at Hockenheim (GER) from 3rd to 5th May. Quotes from the DTM test in Jerez de la Frontera. Timo Glock: “After the long winter, I could hardly wait to get back behind the wheel and was very excited about our new turbocharged BMW M4 DTM. I have to say that it lived up to all my expectations. You can really feel the extra engine power and torque. The modifications to the aerodynamics mean that the car behaves differently. These are things that we, as drivers, must adapt to, and for which we must fine-tune our driving style. However, after my first days of testing, I can confirm that the new BMW M4 DTM is great fun. Although the weather was generally far from ideal, it was a very productive test. We made more progress with the development of the new car and will continue this work in April at the Lausitzring.” Bruno Spengler: “Although the unsettled weather meant the conditions could have been better, we were able to work through many points on our test programme and made further progress with the development of the car. It is great fun to be involved in the development of a car like this, as you can see the progress being made over the course of the winter tests. We still have a bit more work to do between now and the start of the season, but we will have plenty of opportunity for that out on the track at the Lausitzring test. We will go into greater detail there, in preparation for Hockenheim, and will continue to optimise the car for the opening races. The whole team has worked hard over the winter and done a great job to give us the best car possible. We now head to the Lausitzring for the final phase of preparations, then it is already time for the first races.” \n"}

Latest awardee Zac Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland) will be on the ground in Hong Kong for the documentation of his BMW Art Journey project “Sutures of the Sky”. His journey took him across a world that humans and birds have been navigating through millennia. He followed the flight paths of birds like the white stork or the arctic tern, traveling along the earth’s axis where the Northern and Southern Hemispheres’ summers intersect. Migrating birds cover some of the longest distances traveled by any living being. Their routes have guided the Polynesian pathfinders across the seas. Inspired by this ancient celestial tracing, Langdon-Pole's journey questions the position of humans as the center of the world. Weaving through Europe and the Pacific Islands of Samoa and Hawaii, his BMW Art Journey seeks to understand how culture intersects with the science of celestial mapping – and from there flows into larger existential inquiries about who we are and how we are situated in the world.Zac Langdon-Pole will take part in the Art Basel´s Conversations series on Saturday, March 30, 2019 “Artists Telling Stories: Narrative Forms and Strategies”.For further information, please visit: www.press.bmwgroup.com\/zac-langdon-pole-has-commenced-his-bmw-art-journeyAn international jury of experts will gather again at the upcoming Art Basel show in Hong Kong to select a shortlist of three artists from the Discoveries sector for the next BMW Art Journey.

By painting the BMW 3.0 CSL in 1975 Alexander Calder laid the foundation stone for the Art Car Collection. It was also one of his final works of art before he passed away. As a sculptor who normally devised his own shapes, Calder managed to free himself from the formal structure of racing cars and, by painting them, aspired to give them his own distinctive mark. As in the case of his sculptures and mobiles, he used intensive colors and gracefully sweeping surfaces which he distributed generously over the wings, bonnet and roof.It was originally the French racing driver Hervé Poulain who had the idea of letting an artist have his or her way with an automobile. Poulain commissioned American artist and friend Alexander Calder to paint his BMW racing car in the early 70's; this was the spark which led BMW to establish the Art Car Collection.Since then, prominent artists from throughout the world have designed BMW automobiles of their times, all making extremely different artistic statements. The nineteen exhibits created for the Art Car Collection until now include works by well-known artists such as Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, A.R. Penck, David Hockney, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, John Baldessari and Cao Fei. The Art Cars reflect the cultural and historical development of art, design, and technology.BMW is a global partner of Art Basel also supporting the shows in Basel and Miami Beach as a long-term partner.Furthermore, BMW and Artsy joined forces to collaborate on promoting the arts on a global scale.

This weekend, Hong Kong (HKG) is the venue for the first Far East round of the 2018\/19 ABB FIA Formula E Championship. After second place for António Félix da Costa (POR) in Mexico City (MEX), BMW i Andretti Motorsport is out to back-up its fine recent form at the Hong Kong E-Prix. Alexander Sims (GBR) is also hungry to finish in the points again in Asia. The Hong Kong E-Prix represents the 50th race in the short history of Formula E. BMW i has supported the series from the outset as “Official Vehicle Partner”. With 45 starts to his name, Félix da Costa is one of just ten drivers to have contested 40 or more Formula E races. The Andretti Autosport team has been involved in every race so far. The BMW iFE.18 attracted plenty of attention in Hong Kong even before the start of the actual race week. The car visited a number of the most famous locations in the Asian metropolis. The tour produced some spectacular images, which can be downloaded from the BMW Group PressClub: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2VzI945. Quotes ahead of the Hong Kong E-Prix: Jens Marquardt (BMW Motorsport Director):“António’s second place in Mexico City has given the whole team another big boost. Although things did not go entirely to plan for him in previous races, with second place in the Drivers’ Championship, he is still within striking distance of the leader. The most important thing in this phase of the season is to consistently pick up points. That also goes for Alexander, who was involved in a crash through no fault of his own in Mexico. Bearing in mind the promising pace he has shown, I am confident that he will produce another good result in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong E-Prix is a particularly important event for the championship. Formula E has already been captivating its fans for 50 races. BMW i has supported the series as ‘Official Vehicle Partner’ from day one. The Andretti team has competed in every race and António is one of the most experienced drivers in the field. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Alejandro Agag on this milestone.” Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“Hong Kong is one of the iconic Formula E circuits. It is located in the heart of the city and has a very narrow, winding and bumpy layout. It is a racetrack, on which Andretti has enjoyed success in the past. I think our two drivers have a good chance of competing at the front of the field again in Hong Kong. After the successful weekend in Mexico City, the goal is now for both drivers to score plenty of points for the team.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18):“I am really looking forward to going to Hong Kong. It’s a great city and I can hardly wait to drive against the breathtaking backdrop of the harbour. I’ve only ever driven the circuit in a simulator so far. It’s quite twisty and very demanding. As with every weekend, my goal will be to be to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible. I think it will be tougher than in Mexico, as the peculiarities of a true street circuit can’t be underestimated. However we have a quick car, so we travel to Hong Kong confident that we can score good points.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18):“Hong Kong has always been a good circuit for me. After the strong result in Mexico City, I am really looking forward to driving there. I can hardly wait to get back in the BMW iFE.18. We must now perform consistently. The team is highly motivated – as am I. It will be the 50th Formula E race, and I have been involved since Season 1. That is something I am also rather proud of.

So, under the motto, “Ask the CEO”, online fans and followers have been asking all sorts of questions regarding the future of mobility. And who better to answer those questions, (the clue is in the title), than the CEO himself! Harald Krüger, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG:Hi Nicki. It’s good to see you. Nicki Shields: Harald, more than one hundred people posted questions to you and today we’re going to take a look at some of them. Autonomous driving is currently one of the defining topics in the auto industry, and Mikkel would like to know how you will shape the future of autonomous electric vehicles. Harald Krüger: We are working full speed on these future technologies. We already established an open development platform at our autonomous driving campus near Munich. Last week, we went one step further. We announced a cooperation with Daimler for a next generation of autonomous driving. We both share the view that customer safety is our absolute top priority. Nicki Shields: Many people asked: Are you going to rely entirely on electric cars from now on? Harald Krüger: Our future is definitely electric. We are very proud to be the overall market leader for electrified vehicles in Europe. We will offer electrified cars in all segments. The very popular BMW X3 is the first model we will offer with three different powertrains: plug-in hybrid, fully-electric, and internal combustion. Nicki Shields: You have said that you will offer at least 25 electrified models by 2025, including 12 fully-electric, is that right? Harald Krüger: Yes, absolutely. This year, we are really picking up the pace with the MINI Electric. And for BMW, the iX3 in 2020, then the i4 in 2021, as well as our new innovation leader, the iNEXT. By the end of next year, we will have launched more than ten new and upgraded electrified models. Nicki Shields: Many of the questions were also about charging infrastructure, including this one from Milan. So what is BMW doing to support and grow this area?Harald Krüger: A good charging infrastructure is essential and we are involved in many efforts to improve this. One of them is CHARGE NOW. Customers benefit from access to one of the world’s largest and fastest growing public charging networks – with over 100,000 charging points in 25 countries. Nicki Shields: On that topic: I believe you have some news to share? Harald Krüger: From today until the end of the Geneva International Motor Show – CHARGE NOW customers in Europe can chargefor free. This is our thank you to those who share our passion and are already driving electric. Nicki Shields: Wow, that’s great news! No charge for charging! Thanks BMW. That’s a real sign of commitment to electro-mobility. Thank you Harald Krüger! As we heard, BMW is rolling out many more new electrified models. At the same time, they are expanding their offer in the high-end segment. Let’s take a look. Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design:Good morning ladies and gentlemen! In the past 12 months BMW has launched six new models, more than ever before in such a brief timeframe. We have launched cars like the new 3 Series, the X5, the Z4 and of course the 8. With the design of these cars we have completely transformed the look and feel of the brand. We have made each car stronger in character while reducing the number of design elements. The side views are clean, only one key feature line which is sharper and more precise than ever before. Today here in Geneva, we are showing the new top end of the BMW brand: The X7 and the new 7! As such, these cars need to have presence and exquisite design details. Slim headlamps in LED and laser technology paired with a vertically oriented grill create a modern and formal presence. In the rear, we have created very slim and sculptural tail lamps connected by a chrome strip and in the case of the new 7 that chrome strip lights up to create a unique night signature for our flagship. In the interior, we are reducing the amount of switches as our cars become more intelligent. The user interface in its 7th generation now allows for more voice and touch input as well as a more personal configuration by the customer. The hard keys that we do have are grouped in two islands and executed in beautiful materials like aluminium and glass. Of course, the comfort in these vehicles is at the highest level as is the quality of the leather and the stitching. With the new 7, the X7 and of course the 8, BMW is raising the bar in terms of modern luxury. Ladies and gentlemen,That transformation of BMW towards a luxury tech brand will continue in 2019. So please stay tuned for more design news throughout the year! Thank you very much! Nicki Shields: Thank you Adrian. The expansion of the luxury and electric vehicle range continues at the BMW Group. Please welcome Pieter Nota, who will join to tell us more… Hi Pieter, it’s good to see you again. One of the questions on social media fits very well here… Diana asks “How do you ensure to be a sustainable company while still offering luxury products”? Pieter Nota, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Sales and Brand BMW, Aftersales BMW Group:The new BMW 7 plug-in hybrid is the perfect example that luxury and sustainability go hand in hand. I was a first hour BMW ActiveHybrid customer back in 2010. And I’m delighted that the plug-in hybrid technology has been developed further and the electrified range is now more than enough for my daily trips to work and back. Nicki Shields: Pieter, many of the questions that were asked online were regarding hybrid technology… Harald Hohmann asks: “Do you want to push more BMW fully electric models on the market or will BMW also invest in plug-in hybrids”? Pieter Nota: We focus on both fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles to suit various customer needs. Plug-in hybrids are the perfect solution for people who want to combine zero local emission driving in the city and longer trips without having to recharge. They provide a way to quickly improve air quality in urban areas. Hybrid technology definitely has its place. Today we are making a clear statement about that. Now, ladies and gentleman – the world premiere of four new BMW plug-in hybrid models. Pieter Nota: Today we are presenting our fourth generation of plug-in hybrid powertrains, with high-voltage batteries that allow for up to 80 km fully-electric range.For the very first time, we are presenting our BMW X3 as a plug-in hybrid. As we have announced, next year we will launch the all-electric iX3. The BMW X3 is one of our best-selling models worldwide and customers will be able to choose the drive train technology that best suits their needs. This is what I call a true customer-centric approach! In addition to these four models, the 2 and 5 Series plug-in hybrids also have more electric range thanks to the new battery technology. And there’s great news for 5 Series fans: The BMW 5 Series plug-in hybrid will soon be available worldwide with BMW xDrive. Ladies and gentlemen,With the expansion of our line-up, we will offer customers a plug-in hybrid in every segment. By the end of this year – we will offer a total of ten plug-in hybrid vehicles. All of this underlines our deep commitment to sustainable electric mobility. Nicki Shields: Pieter it was great to hear about the progress BMW is making in e-mobility and to see the new plug-in hybrids. Let’s not forget, as well as on our roads, BMW is also using its eDrive technology and know-how in the world of electric motorsport, with a team in the all-electric Formula E. The car is on display over on my right, and the team will be racing on the streets of Hong Kong this weekend – Good luck! Thank you so much to all the fans for watching and your questions – all the questions will be answered online after. Thank you everyone for joining us today – we wish you a very exciting and successful Geneva International Motor Show!\n"}
{"prompt":"Courage, independence, competing with the best while forging new pathways – these have been the characteristics of the BMW Group since 7 March 1916. Today, BMW Group Classic is looking back on a series of events, record achievements and innovations, from the altitude world record in 1919, through the debut of the Mini 60 years ago, to the invention of the modern SUV with the X5 in 1999 – many others will follow in the course of 2019.  ->","completion":" Munich. On 7 March 2019, the anniversary of the company’s establishment was celebrated for the 103rd time. During this period, a small aero-engine factory transformed itself into the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and motorcycles. This development reflects the character of the company and the key people who shaped its success. The company ethos is based on the courage to innovate, the readiness to go the extra mile, the drive to compete with the best and the ability to overcome special challenges. In 2019, BMW Group Classic looks back on numerous events, outstanding achievements and innovations that are based on precisely these principles.100 years ago: A high-altitude flight as the first record for BMW.On 17 June 1919, the experienced test pilot Franz Zeno Diemer set out to help the fledgling company BMW achieve a first world record. He took off from Munich’s Oberwiesenfeld airfield piloting his aeroplane manufactured by Deutsche Flugzeugwerke and powered by the BMW IV aero-engine on the route to a sensational record attempt. The 230 hp engine was designed on the basis of a principle conceived especially for flying at great altitudes. Diemer took around one and a half hours to fly his machine up to an altitude of 9,760 metres. In the open cockpit, he had to contend with temperatures down to minus 50 degrees and breathe in air with gradually diminishing oxygen levels. Never before had an aircraft flown so high.90 years ago: The BMW 3\/15 hp – launch on four wheels.Ten years later, BMW had already expanded its product portfolio with motorcycles – then came the next step. The Board of Management decided to get involved in the automobile business. The Chairman was Franz-Josef Popp, who had held a management position with the company in the early stages of aero-engine production. “Our experience in the area of motorcycle construction encouraged us to embark on the production of small cars, for which there appears to be a promising domestic market. With this end in mind, we purchased automaker Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach,” announced Popp in the company’s Annual Report. On 22 March 1929, the first BMW 3\/15 PS left the assembly halls in Berlin-Johannisthal. Almost 16,000 units of the new small car followed in the years up to 1932.60 years ago: Debut for the classic Mini.He sketched out the first design drafts on a napkin. The designer Alec Issigonis created a revolutionary small car on the basis of the resulting plans. On 4 April 1959, the first classic Mini rolled off the assembly line at the Austin Longbridge plant in Birmingham. In spite of an external length of 3.05 metres, the little car provided sufficient space for four occupants and their luggage. Issigonis applied a completely new design at the time, with front-wheel drive, a four-cylinder transverse engine mounted at the front of the car, and the gearbox configured beneath. This design layout was soon adopted by virtually all manufacturers in modified form. It offered the best prerequisites for the principle of creative use of space and for excitingly agile driving performance – attributes which characterise the models of the British premium brand to this day.60 years ago: The turnaround was achieved with the compact BMW 700.During the 1950s, the company made significant contributions to getting people in the young Federal Republic of Germany on the road with the BMW Isetta and the BMW 600 that was derived from it. However, the aspirations of the customers continued to rise and it was necessary to create a new small car with a conventional design in order to compensate for falling sales. The Viennese BMW importer, automobile designer and former racing driver Wolfgang Denzel provided the key impetus. He presented the BMW Board of Management with the design for a two-door notchback car that had been designed by the Italian designer Giovanni Michelotti. The prototype formed the platform for the BMW 700, which was presented for the first time on 9 June 1959. By 1965, more than 190 000 units had been sold and BMW succeeded in ascending out of the economic trough.60 years ago: Small shareholders defend the independence of BMW.Sales problems in the automobile and motorcycle business had caused BMW serious financial difficulties during the 1950s. At the Annual General Meeting held on 9 December 1959, the takeover of the company by Daimler-Benz AG was therefore an item on the agenda. However, the restructuring plan associated with the takeover was opposed by many of the small shareholders. During the course of a turbulent discussion, the lawyer Friedrich Mathern managed to depict inconsistences about the official figures. He objected that all the development costs for the BMW 700 had unjustifiably been included in the balance sheet for 1958. He also criticised the fact that the value of the BMW brand and its employees had been valued much too low. The meeting was then adjourned – with the result that the time-limited offer from Stuttgart expired. BMW remained independent but the financial crisis had not been resolved. The increased commitment of major shareholder Herbert Quandt ultimately provided the assurance needed to move forward. In the following year, he submitted a new restructuring plan which also took account of the interests expressed by the small shareholders.50 years ago: A new era of motorcycle production begins.Aero-engines had already been manufactured in Berlin-Spandau under the direction of BMW since the 1930s and after World War II motorcycle and car compnents as well. In 1969, the entire production of motorcycles was relocated from Munich to Berlin. The start of production for the BMW \/5 Series went hand in hand with the move. The technical director at the time, Helmut Werner Bönsch, presented it with self-assured words: “There is no doubt that BMW has been building the best and most advanced motorcycle in the world for many years. Our ambition is to maintain this reputation into the future.” This was indeed the case. The BMW 50\/5, BMW R 60\/5 and BMW R 75\/5 models had been developed as sporty touring motorcycles in a modern design, and they had a completely new chassis with telescopic fork for the front wheel and variable rear-wheel suspension. And for the first time, customers were able to choose between versions with different colours.40 years ago: The BMW M1 lined up on the grid in the Procar Series.The BMW M1 mid-engined sports car was already irresistible when it was standing still. But it developed its true fascination on the racing track. This emerged above all in the Procar Series initiated by the Managing Director of BMW Motorsport GmbH at the time, Jochen Neerpasch. The races were staged in 1979 and 1980 as part of the warm-up for the Formula 1 World Championship races in Europe and they developed into a runaway success with the public. The protagonists themselves were also captivated by Neerpasch’s idea of staging races between Formula 1 drivers and touring car drivers piloting vehicles with identical engineering and generating 470 hp. On 12 May 1979, the first race in the Procar Series started in Zolder, Belgium, and 16 more races were to follow.20 years ago: World premiere for the BMW X5.An all-rounder with all-wheel drive which was not only capable of impressive driving on off-road terrain but also demonstrated excellent performance on the road – this was how the BMW X5 was presented in autumn of 1999, as the world’s first Sports Activity Vehicle. A few months later, the BMW X5 Le Mans demonstrated its huge potential for dynamic driving. This was an experimental vehicle with a V12 engine generating more than 700 hp. Racing driver Hans-Joachim Stuck achieved a top speed of 309 km\/h in this car on the Nürburgring. 20 years after the debut of the first SAV, the family of BMW X models has grown to seven model series. In 2018, 37.3 percent of the brand’s total sales were generated by BMW X models.20 years ago: The BMW Z8 exerts fascinating appeal with classic aesthetics.In 1999, BMW also presented a milestone in its roadster history, which was certainly not lacking in highlights. The BMW Z8 styled by Danish designer Henrik Fisker created a sensation at its world premiere on the occasion of the International Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA). The elegant lines recalled the legendary BMW 507 and the luxurious cockpit make it an eye-catcher to this day. The classic forms clothed innovative engineering: a self-supporting aluminium frame with the external skin bolted on, powered by a 400 hp V8 engine. A total of 5,703 units of the BMW Z8 were manufactured between 2000 and 2003 at a dedicated production facility established especially for this vehicle at the BMW plant in Munich.BMW Group Classic will be saluting these anniversaries in a variety of events and publications during the course of 2019. In the meantime, the Press Department of BMW Group Classic is providing more detailed information on the topics outlined above.\n"}

The development of a BMW two-man bobsled, which is the result of the partnership with the German Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton Federation (BSD), has reached an crucial milestone: Test rides at Königssee and in Altenberg delivered promising results. The sled concept developed exclusively using computer simulations and verified in the BMW Aerodynamic and Research Center has proven successful. Additional optimisation potential for the prototype will be identified during further test rides in the coming weeks and will feed into the design of a new sled. The goal is to use this in the coming 2019\/2020 World Cup season. At the end of a development and test phase that lasted ten months only, the BMW prototype passed its baptism of fire with flying colours. With double Olympic champion Francesco Friedrich, world champion Johannes Lochner and junior world champion Christoph Hafer on the steering handles, the run times at the test rides at Königssee and on the demanding track in Altenberg were within a few tenths of a second of the current World Cup bob.A measuring system provided by BMW Motorsport and modified for bobsleds evaluated and compared all of the rides. Friedrich’s impressions were extremely positive.“It’s fascinating: BMW takes something on, and at the first attempt it is really very good. So many companies have already tried to build a sled, which was then mothballed after three days. In contrast, the BMW prototype has already come a long way. The bob runs really well and you can steer it precisely,” said the overall World Cup winner. “The BMW engineers work very meticulously and with a lot of passion to make sure it is as fast as or faster than the others.”The innovative approach to the development of the new two-man bob started from nothing, oriented itself on BMW vehicle development and focused on the replicability of the sled. It was also about finding the perfect balance between the stability and agility of the sled.Initially, the design was developed exclusively using computer simulations and the aerodynamics were optimised using the “computational fluid dynamics (CFD)” numerical method. Around 10,000 different forms were calculated, including “digitalised athlete dummies”: To develop sporting equipment with the ideal ergonomics for the various BSD drivers and crewmen, the athletes were scanned, and their body dimensions were incorporated into the calculations.The design developed this way, considering aerodynamic and ergonomic aspects was initially milled as a foam model, the values calculated on the computer were verified in the BMW Group Aerodynamic Test Centre and optimised in line with the analysis results obtained. This form was manufactured using carbon to ensure reproducibility. The cutting of the individual carbon layers was computer-controlled, and these carbon layers were placed such that the sled is able to absorb the huge G forces in the ice track optimally. Then, the model was baked in an autoclave at 175 degrees. Thomas Hahn’s, head of the BMW technology transfer, development team received support from the BMW partner network in the motorsport sector.“The approach and pioneering spirit of our technology partner BMW is impressive time and again,” said Thomas Schwab, general secretary and sports director of the BSD. “We are delighted that in the BMW prototype an innovative approach demonstrated its great potential right from the start and are excited to see what further development brings.”Hahn is very pleased with the intermediate result and said: “The initial test results are promising – both at Königssee and on an extreme track like the one in Altenberg. We started with a blank sheet of paper and it turned out that our calculations stood the test in practice. Now we need to push the limits further in additional tests and based on these results, identify the areas in which we can make improvements.”\n"}

The new BMW S 1000 RR has already proved to be a consistent points collector on its debut weekend in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Again in Sunday’s race at Phillip Island (AUS), both BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team riders scored world championship points. Markus Reiterberger (GER) finished 12th, immediately followed by team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) in 13th.On Sunday at noon, the new “Superpole Race” was on the programme, a sprint race over ten laps, in which Sykes and Reiterberger took positions 11 and 12. The afternoon race was run over 22 laps, as on Saturday. Sykes started from tenth on the grid, with Reiterberger from 13th. In the opening stage, Sykes had a ‘moment’ when battling with another rider and lost positions while Reiterberger fell back slightly at the start. Over the course of the race, however, both riders worked their way forward and together were part of a closely fighting group of five. The two team-mates also exchanged positions several times. Ultimately, Reiterberger finished 1.3 seconds ahead of Sykes. Phillip Island also hosted the 2019 Australian Superbike Championship (ASBK) season opener at the weekend. Glenn Allerton (AUS) from the NextGen Motorsports\/ Maxima BMW team was the highest placed BMW rider. In the three races held, he claimed two seventh places and one ninth place. His team-mate Ted Collins (AUS) finished 11th twice and once in tenth position. Quotes after race two at Phillip Island. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We have to be satisfied with the first race weekend with our brand new BMW S 1000 RR. We could, however, also see in the ‘Superpole Race’ and in race two that we still can’t recall our true pace. We still lose on the straight, but at other points of the track we are then right behind the competition again. If we were alone on the track, we would set top-six or top-eight times, but if we are in a race in the pack, we can’t reproduce them because we are stuck. So the positive thing is that our theoretical pace is already very good. Now we will do everything we can to improve in our straight-line deficit. But this first race weekend makes me basically confident for the course of the season.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We’ve got to be realistic and we have probably reached our goals for the first time we raced the BMW S 1000 RR so we are very happy. We have had no major incidents and I think that we have proved that the bike is going to be competitive very soon. We clearly have our limitations at the moment and we will work hard on sorting them out in the break before the next races. Both riders rode very well and both have been very patient in understanding that we need to wait for the development parts to come through. So from my side the overall summary is that we can look forward to a very competitive bike over the course of the season. We just need to be patient and wait for that to arrive.” Markus Reiterberger: “Today was much better than yesterday. I really enjoyed the race. Even though I missed my goal, the top-ten, I could at least see that it was possible. I would have had the necessary pace if I had not started so far back after difficulties in qualifying and if I had made a better start. In the race itself I had a better feeling from the beginning, and above all more self-confidence. Although the grip level was even worse at today’s higher temperatures than yesterday, we did a good job and took another step in the right direction. I was able to out-brake some opponents and gain a lot in the corners – that’s where our BMW S 1000 RR is really phenomenal. Unfortunately overtaking is still difficult for us because we lose at the corner exit and on the straight. I take the positives: the top-ten was possible, the feeling is better and the direction is right. I would like to thank the entire team that works tirelessly to make this progress possible. We are competing in the world championship; that’s not a walk in the park. We are a very young project and the potential is definitely there. Now I can’t wait until we head to the next races.” Tom Sykes: “It has been a challenging day but I have to say that our results do not reflect where we really are. It is just unfortunate that at the moment the bike still has some limitations in straight-line performance but it’s still very early days. On the positive side we have a very good chassis set-up so we were able to make some good passes but then lost again on the easy part of the track. We have shown what is possible by being in the top-five during all tests and practices when we are riding alone, so we know which area we have to work on with the bike and we now have some race mileage under our belt. And I know that now the entire BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team will work hard to keep progressing like we did over winter.” \n"}

The new BMW S 1000 RR has completed its race debut – just three months, after the series version was presented to the world.

His team-mate Markus Reiterberger crossed the line in 13th place. Sykes secured fourth place on the grid in the Superpole qualifying on Saturday morning. In the race he rode in the top-six for a long time before slightly dropping back in the closing stages. Reiterberger started from 13th place. After losing a few positions at the start, he rode back into the points positions with his brand-new RR in the following laps. Quotes after race one at Phillip Island. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: “The first race was an immensely important milestone for us, and we can be very satisfied with the result. We knew that our new BMW S 1000 RR has a very good base for its use in WorldSBK but we certainly could not expect that both riders would score points in the first race. A big compliment to the entire team and colleagues at home in Munich and Berlin for the work done in the short development time. Nevertheless, we also saw today that we still have great potential.” Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We are quite happy with the weekend so far. We have shown in the sessions that we can be with the front-runners. On the other hand, you can also see where we are still losing time at the moment but we were aware of that when we came here after the few test days and we are working on it. As soon as we improve in this area, we’ll be in the mix. We are also pleased because two and a half months ago, we did not expect these results.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I think both riders did very well. We could not have expected much more from Tom. He was in a battle with the front guys. In a better situation we could have stayed in the tow, but eventually another rider and him messed each other up and he lost touch with the front guys. In my heart, I felt top six was a possibility; seventh is kind of where we expected to be. So for me, Tom had a great race. On the other side of the garage, Markus obviously suffered with qualifying and a poor start. I addition, he struggled with grip but he was in the company of some very good riders and finished only ten seconds behind his team-mate – with a much poorer grid position. So we can take a lot of hope from it and will make some changes overnight.” Tom Sykes: “Consistently, we have been there in the mix so I am obviously quite surprised about the progress of the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. To be so competitive after just six test days is quite special. I think everybody has seen on track that we had some limitation on the straight line but the positive is that the BMW S 1000 RR is certainly doing its job in the corners. There’s no arguing that we have a very good base set-up in terms of chassis, electronics and brakes. The potential is definitely there. We have one race under our belt now; we keep on working and we keep on progressing. And I have to say: for the base start, I think we surprised quite a lot of people.” Markus Reiterberger: “We continued to improve in morning practice, but it seems that we start struggling with grip as soon as temperatures rise. In the Superpole, we had an issue with a sensor but I also have to admit that I did not have that comfortable feeling and therefore didn’t have a good lap. Unfortunately my start was not the best, and on the first laps I tried to save the rear tyre for the distance. I succeeded, but overall it was just not possible to finish further ahead. Position 13 is not what I personally expected, but for BMW, finishing seventh was a good result. I think there is still a lot of potential in me and in the bike that we can exploit. We will keep working and I’m sure we will succeed.” \n"}

BMW Art Journey winner, Zac Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland), has completed the first leg of his journey and is now on the second leg with the aim of tracing the gaps and relations between the culturally-constructed star systems. Entitled ‘Sutures of the Sky: A Journey Tracing Obscured Histories of the Heavens’, the journey takes Langdon-Pole across a world which humans and birds have been navigating for millennia. Langdon-Pole has thus far completed his journey in Europe and is currently travelling through the Pacific Islands of Hawaii, Samoa and finally New Zealand where he will consolidate his artwork.Inspired by ancient celestial tracing methodology, Langdon-Pole's journey questions the position of humans as the center of the world. Weaving through Europe, and the Pacific islands of Samoa and Hawaii, his Art Journey seeks to understand how culture intersects with the science of celestial mapping, and consequently how it transcends into larger existential inquiries about our identities and our location in this increasingly globalized world. In the latter half of this journey, he will follow the flight paths of birds that travel along the earth’s axis where the Northern and Southern Hemispheres’ summers intersect. Transcending traditional art practices, Langdon-Pole will incorporate unlikely combinations of images, objects and histories from specific origins to trace the gaps, relations and interpolations between cultures, generations and epochs in his Art Journey.Taking place in European cities of London, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Dordrecht, Paris, Montignac, and Marseille the first leg of Langdon-Pole’s journey provided a site for preliminary research on early printed star charts and representations of celestial mapping between different regions. In London, the artist visited the Royal Academy’s ‘Oceania’ exhibition, including works by indigenous artists and craftsmen spanning 500 years that demonstrate the astounding mobility of people in the Pacific Islands throughout history. In France, as part of the last stop of the artist’s journey in Europe, Langdon-Pole viewed a prehistoric map of the night sky situated within the Lascaux caves near Montignac. It dates back at least 16,500 years, depicting star constellations that were believed to keep track of astronomical events. The research and travel during this leg of the BMW Art Journey examined how the star systems of the Southern Hemisphere were imagined from a European perspective across various historical periods.The second leg of the artist’s journey kicked off in Hawai’i, where the artist visited Mauna Kea and Honolulu. The Mauna Kea Observatories, located at the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawai’i, offered Langdon-Pole the opportunity to explore the presence and mediated dominance of Western astronomy as a starting point in the Pacific Ocean. While these observatories represent the pinnacle of scientific and technological engagement with the stars, the artist explored how their presence is entwined with fraught opposition by indigenous Hawaiians.Furthermore, Langdon-Pole will travel to the Marshall Islands to meet with Alson Kelen of the organization Waan Aelõñ in Majel (Canoes of the Marshall Islands) (WAM) on the atoll of Majuro. In doing so the artist aims to learn how connections to these past traditions can tie to the future of these islands in the context of rising sea levels. Amongst delving into star navigation methods of the region, the artist will also research the Mattang, Meddo and Rebbelib ‘stick charts’ that map the wave currents and ocean swells throughout the 34 islands and atolls of the Marshall Islands archipelago.Before heading back to New Zealand to conduct further research and consolidate his work, Langdon-Pole will also visit Apia and Savai’i in Samoa. He will be working together with Samoan-New Zealand artist\/composer Michael Lee to trace traditions of celestial navigation songs. The ways in which Polynesian wayfinders passed down their knowledge and expertise of navigation through generations was often in the form of song, which prompted the artist to trace the historical lineage and remains of these songs throughout the Pacific Islands.The artist will be on the ground in Hong Kong for the documentation of his BMW Art Journey project “Sutures of the Sky” at this year’s Art Basel show. Launched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging artists worldwide. The unique award is open to artists who are exhibiting in the Discoveries sector during Art Basel in Hong Kong. A judging panel comprised of internationally renowned experts meet first to select a shortlist of three artists from the sector, who are then invited to submit proposals for a journey aimed to further develop their ideas and artistic work. The jury reconvenes to choose a winner from the three proposals.Art Basel and BMW will collaborate with the artists to document the journey and share it with a broader public through print publications, online and social media.For further information about the artists and the project, please visit:www.bmw-art-journey.com An international jury of experts will gather again at the upcoming Art Basel show in Hong Kong to select a shortlist of three artists from the Discoveries sector for the next BMW Art Journey.

The race machines used by the two riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Markus Reiterberger (GER) in WorldSBK are based on the new BMW S 1000 RR, which was presented to the world in November. Over winter, engineers at BMW Motorrad Motorsport have developed the necessary racing components for use in the world championship.In preparation for the new BMW S 1000 RR race debut, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team completed two further days of testing on Monday and Tuesday at Phillip Island. The focus was on evaluating more new components and setting up the machines for the first race.The season opener starts with two free practice sessions on Friday. On Saturday, Superpole qualification takes place, with the first race scheduled for 15:00 local time. The ten lap “Superpole Race”, a new introduction in WorldSBK, will start on Sunday at 12:00.

There, Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers, Team Principal Shaun Muir, the two riders and Andreas Lundgren, BMW Motorrad Australia General Manager, will be available for interviews. Quotes ahead of the season opener at Phillip Island. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The results of the two days of testing at Phillip Island are very positive. They confirmed the performance at the test days that we had over winter. We are very proud of the collaboration within the team, which first had to gel in this new configuration. We have all pulled together over the past few months, and we now can see the result of this good teamwork. That’s motivating! But we have to stay realistic and look ahead to the first race. That will be the first time for us to see where we really stand in race trim. We also know that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, but the base of the new BMW S 1000 RR offers a lot of potential. We are happy to be back and we really can’t wait to start the first race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We left the European tests in a very good position and a lot of hard work was carried out to make further improvements at Phillip Island. At the two days of testing here we could clearly see the benefits of the small but very significant improvements to the chassis. Tom went through all the things he wanted to test and had his best package which he ran on Tuesday afternoon in its final configuration. That is a very good base setting for him now to start the season. Markus has taken a big step forward after Portimão and is in a very strong position where we feel he can definitely compete for the top ten in the races at the coming weekend.” Tom Sykes: “Testing has gone really well and after these two test days here at Phillip Island, I want to thank the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team because we worked very well, we worked through a comprehensive list of items and possibilities and certainly boxed off a lot of things. So I am very happy and I really feel that given the limited time on the project everyone has been doing an incredible job. I don’t think that we could have asked for anything more during this testing period. Going into the race weekend now we know that it’s not going to be easy, obviously we need to work a little bit more in some areas, but I really do feel that we are heading in the right direction. We will go out on track, work on further improving the package on our BMW S 1000 RR and enjoy the racing. I feel that the potential is higher than we could have expected when starting the project.” Markus Reiterberger: “I am pretty satisfied with the two test days in Australia. I immediately had a good feeling on the bike, and we worked well through our testing programme, so we can soon focus on fine-tuning the performance. The anticipation for the first race weekend is of course huge, because racing is always something special. On the other hand, I would not mind having a few more test laps to really get the maximum out of myself and the BMW S 1000 RR. We just need a little bit of time to understand the whole package, but I’m pretty happy so far, and I feel great in the team. The guys really give everything and work extremely hard. We also continuously get new options and things from Munich that we can test. You can really see how things are progressing well. Personally, I worked intensively on my fitness during the winter, and I am ready to kick off the season.” \n"}
{"prompt":"António Félix da Costa (POR) finished a turbulent Mexico City E-Prix (MEX), the fourth race of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship season, in second place, to take his second podium of the season after his win in Ad Diriyah (KSA). ->","completion":" Mexico City. António Félix da Costa (POR) finished a turbulent Mexico City E-Prix (MEX), the fourth race of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship season, in second place, to take his second podium of the season after his win in Ad Diriyah (KSA). In the dramatic final stage of the race, the BMW works driver benefitted from strong energy management and moved up from fifth to a podium spot on the final lap. Through no fault of his own, Alexander Sims (GBR) was involved in an accident, which resulted in the race being interrupted, and finished the race in 14th place. As the fastest driver in qualifying group one, Félix da Costa made it to the Super Pole and started the race from fifth on the grid. He remained in that position for almost the entire race and saved enough energy to be able to go on the attack in his #28 BMW iFE.18 in the final stage. While the majority of drivers ahead of him slowed down, Félix da Costa, who once again benefitted from FanBoost during the race, moved up several places. Second place saw him gain 18 points in the drivers’ standings and, with 46 points, he now lies second. BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team is third in the team standings, with 64 points. The win in Mexico went to Lucas di Grassi (BRA). Sims, who qualified in seventh place on the grid, was hit by another car in the opening phase. Behind him, Nelson Piquet Jr. (BRA) collided with Jean-Éric Vergne (FRA), took off and slid off the track out of control and at high speed. He hit the rear of Sims’ #27 BMW iFE.18 in the process. Sims spun and crashed into the barriers and was forced to return to the pits to change the front bodywork. The race was red flagged to clear the track after the accident and after a break of around 30 minutes the BMW i8 Coupé Safety Car, with its new design, restarted the field. Reactions to the Mexico City E-Prix: Jens Marquardt (BMW Motorsport Director):“What a race! António Félix da Costa battled superbly and kept his cool in his duel with Sébastien Buemi. Then, in the closing stage, our good energy efficiency and race strategy paid off. It was literally in the final metres that António moved up onto the podium. It’s a shame for Alexander Sims that he got caught up in an accident at the start of the race, through no fault of his own. If that hadn’t been the case, no doubt he would have finished much higher up the field. Congratulations to António and the entire team. Once again, we managed to convert the magnificent potential of the BMW iFE.18 into a top result. Long may it continue.” Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“Racing in front of such a great crowd and finishing on the podium with António in the end is just amazing. I still have the memory of all the fans standing in front of the podium and all the BMW flags flying. Congrats to António who drove a very smart race. The engineers did a really good job to sort out the energy management. I feel sorry for Alex. He was an innocent victim today.” António Félix da Costa (#28 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 5th place, race result: 2nd place, FANBOOST voting: 3rd place, points: 46):“Ahead of the race weekend, I said that we need to give it our all here to pick up as many points as possible. The fact that we managed second place will no doubt be great motivation for the entire team. I had a duel with Sébastien Buemi relatively early on in the race, during which I touched his car slightly. After that my steering was skewed, which naturally put me at something of a disadvantage, so I simply maintained my position after that and saved energy. As the end of the race drew near it became clear that some of the cars in front of me might start having problems, so I waited for my chance – and then took it. I’m delighted with the podium.” Alexander Sims (#27 BMW iFE.18, qualifying result: 7th place, race result: 14th place, FANBOOST voting: 15th place, points: 18)“It isn’t the result that we had hoped for but it was out of our hands today. After Nelson Piquet Jr. hit my car the team’s reaction was fantastic and they got me back out on track as quickly as possible after the repairs. The car wasn’t working as well after that but I could still gain valuable experience and data. Those are the positives from today’s race.” The BMW i FleetBMW i is “Official Vehicle Partner” of the ABB FIA Formula E Championship in Season 5.
