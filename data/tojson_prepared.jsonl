In preparation for the 2022 season of the FIM    Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad Motorsport    this week completed the first of three back-to-back pre-season    tests. In Misano (ITA), the two BMW teams – the BMW Motorrad    WorldSBK Team and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team – both worked    through an extensive test programme on Wednesday and Thursday. A    further two tests will follow in Barcelona (ESP) on 25th and 26th    March, and at MotorLand Aragón (ESP) on 4th and 5th April. Many areas of the BMW M 1000 RR have been optimised and developed  over the course of the winter break. As such, Scott Redding (GBR \/ BMW  Motorrad WorldSBK Team) and the two riders from the Bonovo action BMW  Racing Team, Eugene Laverty (IRL) and Loris Baz (FRA), tested many new  components and set-up variants. The areas that have been developed by  BMW Motorrad Motorsport include the engine, brakes, riding geometry  and ergonomics as seats and fuel tank shapes. In addition, individual  rideability options for the riders had been generated in the  electronics area. The three factory riders provided more input, on the basis of which  BMW Motorrad Motorsport and the two teams will now work closely  together to prepare for the coming tests. BMW newcomers Redding and  Baz also used the test to familiarise themselves further with the BMW  M 1000 RR. Overall, the three riders completed over 1,700 kilometres  of testing without any issues. Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team was  unable to attend the test in Misano, due to an injury. He fractured  his leg in a crash whilst training on his mountain bike. This injury  also means the Dutchman is unable to take part in the tests in  Barcelona and at MotorLand Aragón. BMW factory rider Ilya Mikhalchik  (UKR) will replace him as the reserve rider at these tests. Three-time  IDM champion Mikhalchik is part of the BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team in the FIM Endurance World Championship and also lines up in the  Spanish Superbike Championship this season. Quotes after the Misano test. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “First of all, we wish Michael a good and speedy recovery, of course.  His absence shortly before the start of the season is obviously very  unfortunate. With him being absent we partly were missing a reference  to last year’s topics which made the test work a bit more difficult.  However, in Ilya we have a very good replacement, who will stand in  for him at the next two tests. With him we can now work through the  test list, fine-tune the 2022 package and Michael’s crew can gel. Ilya  knows the BMW M 1000 RR well and is thus able to provide valuable  input. He is a strong BMW factory rider, and has thus earned the  opportunity to test the WorldSBK package. Nevertheless, our two days  of testing have been overall very constructive. Our new riders could  gather experience with the BMW M 1000 RR and get acquainted with the  new developments.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We had only one rider testing with Scott but it has been a  real positive test. The feedback we got from all our test items was  that we made good steps forward over the winter period. So from Jerez  to where we are today has confirmed what we have been doing, mainly  chassis, electronics and engine. Especially the engine development has  proved to be a good steps for all the guys from BMW. The first day was  a lot about evaluation and the second day was a bit more of  fine-tuning the set-up and that went pretty well. I am really happy  with the fact that we focused mainly on the SC0 tyre for him. He has  not got that set-up yet for him where he could use the extra grip of  the SCX or the SCQ. So all work was with the SC0 and it was a good,  solid test with a lot of positives to take away.” Scott Redding, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “So we  finished the two days test here in Misano. I’m really happy with the  work that we have done. We changed a lot at the bike angles. We had  some new parts to test. That changed a lot on the bike. So we focused  mainly on getting a feeling for me with this bike. It was very  positive, and I enjoyed the two days here. We made some good steps,  and we managed to close the gap to the front guys. That was important  to me. I can go home from this test very happy. So we are going in the  right direction, and I’m looking forward to Barcelona.” Michael Galinski, Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team:  “As a team we are really satisfied with this test on both  sides of the garage, as both riders made a step forward. Overall, they  have been on the same level. The new parts, especially the new engines  we got from BMW, are top and a significant improvement. We made some  steps forward also with the other items we could test. We are still  lacking nine tenths of a second to the very top but we got closer und  were able to continuously improve. The team grew together very well.  Both sides are on the same level now, and it was the second time for  us to work in the final team constellation. Now I am already looking  forward to the Barcelona test. This will be another challenge as it is  known that there is a bit less grip. Nevertheless we are looking  forward to it and to the next step we can make there.” Eugene Laverty, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “Today  was really good. I made some progress because yesterday I still didn’t  feel quite comfortable on the bike. Today especially in braking  improved a lot. The bike is now transferring correctly. I’m a smaller  rider than the other guys. So we needed to make some changes. Now I  feel much more comfortable and make some really consistent lap time.  So I’m really happy with the step.” Loris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I am  really happy. I did not know what to expect. In Jerez, everything was  totally new for me coming from a completely different bike. After  then, we had a long break, so I was really happy to get back on the  BMW M 1000 RR. This track is completely different, also the grip level  is completely different but I was pretty happy straight away with the  new engine spec and the electronic development that the guys have  done. So, yes, I am really happy with the direction they took, I think  it is the right one. I am happy with the pace and over the two days I  managed to do a lot of consistent laps on the race tyre. I’m really  happy with the job done, we are also close to Scott and Eugene so it’s  a good direction for BMW.” \n"}

As well as Turner    Motorsport, Paul Miller Racing will also run BMW M Motorsport’s new    GT3 flagship in the GTD class. The #24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 of BMW M Team RLL will be driven by Philipp  Eng (AUT), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) at Sebring.  Sharing the driving duties in the #25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 will be John  Edwards (USA), Connor De Phillippi (USA) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). BMW  M Team RLL has a successful past in Sebring; Bobby Rahal’s (USA) team  took victory in the GTLM class in 2011 and 2012. In the 2018 race, BMW  M Team RLL claimed the first pole position and the first podium result  for the BMW M8 GTE.  For Turner Motorsport driver Bill Auberlen (USA), the 12-hour Sebring  race brings up a very special milestone, the 500th race with BMW for  the record IMSA winner. The Californian has been part of the BMW M  Motorsport family since 1996. During this quarter of a century,  Auberlen has won many races with every BMW race car he has driven. At  Sebring, he races alongside Robby Foley and Michael Dinan (both USA)  in the #96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3. At the same time, BMW M Motorsport will also welcome a new family  member in Sebring: Paul Miller Racing. The New Jersey team, which has  enjoyed IMSA success for several years, will run the BMW M4 GT3 in the  GTD class. Alternating at the wheel of the #1 car are Madison Snow,  Bryan Sellers (both USA) and Erik Johansson (SWE). The 70th staging of the 12 Hours of Sebring gets underway at 10:10  local time (15:10 CET) on Saturday 19th March.

Stephen Cameron Racing will run the #43 BMW M4  GT4, with Sean Quinlan and Gregory Liefooghe (both USA) at the wheel. Quotes ahead of the Sebring 12 Hours: Andreas Roos (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The 12  Hours of Sebring is the second highlight of the IMSA season and the  next test for the new BMW M4 GT3. We have precisely analysed and now  understand the problems we had at Daytona. We expect a significant  step forward in terms of reliability and performance. The BMW M4 GT3  has great potential, and we are working hard to exploit that potential  better from race to race. For me personally, it is the first race I am  attending as Head of BMW M Motorsport. I am really looking forward to  working with the engineers, teams and drivers. I am particularly  pleased that we have three teams on the grid with the BMW M4 GT3, in  BMW M Team RLL, Turner Motorsport and Paul Miller Racing.” Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW M Team RLL): “Over  the years we have seen good success at Sebring. We have had two GTLM  victories and last year, we had the heartbreak of being taken out of  the probable victory just before the chequered flag waved. Sebring is  such a historic race. There are not that many races older. I am always  excited to go to Sebring because of that history.” Nick Yelloly (BMW M Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3):  “I am very excited to be back in the US with BMW M Team RLL for the  second race of the season. I was fortunate enough to do Sebring in  2020 with Turner Motorsport, so I have done the race before in the GTD  class and have a bit of experience. It looks like we have made some  good progress with our BMW M4 GT3 with the testing over in Europe so I  am looking forward to getting the new baby on track and at the sharp  end of the field. I am sharing the car with Marco and Philipp again,  two great racing drivers, and we will give our very best to get a  strong result.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW M Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M4  GT3): “I’m very excited to get back to Sebring in our new BMW  M4 GT3. It will be the first laps for many of us on that track with  the new machine but I know we have all been preparing for this  situation. We are in a much better position than at the start of the  season and I’m looking forward to getting on track.” Bill Auberlen (Turner Motorsport, #96 BMW M4 GT3):  “When I look back on 500 races with BMW, I am humbled and proud. When  I look to what the next seasons may bring, I say bring on race number  600! It feels appropriate that my 500th for BMW comes at Sebring as  the 12 Hour is a special race for me. In 1985, I was the truck driver  and crew for my father’s win there. Ten years later I scored my first  win at the 12 Hour.”\n"}

{"prompt":"Pieter Nota: “Top-quality car cachet”  Long-term future of ALPINA brand secured  Andreas Bovensiepen: “This marks the beginning of a new chapter for ALPINA and BOVENSIEPEN”  Existing cooperation agreement expires at end of 2025  New direction at Buchloe site   ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group welcomes a new addition to its  portfolio, as the ALPINA brand becomes part of the company. The BMW  Group will secure the rights to the ALPINA brand – bringing even  greater diversity to its own luxury-car range. BMW AG and ALPINA  Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG have reached an agreement to this  effect that will secure the long-term future of the ALPINA brand as  well as the Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH und Co. KG. The conclusion of the transaction is still subject to various  suspensive conditions – in particular, approval by the responsible  antitrust authorities. The long-standing cooperation agreement, which  was extended for another five years in late 2020, will expire on 31  Dec. 2025. Both parties have agreed not to disclose any financial  details. No shares in the company will be acquired. Over half a century, BMW and the small-series manufacturer from  Buchloe, outside of Munich, have forged a close cooperation built on  the highest level of trust. Now, the transformation of the automotive  industry enters a new chapter. “The automotive industry is in the midst of a far-reaching  transformation towards sustainable mobility. For that reason, existing  business models need to be re-examined on a regular basis. For over  fifty years, the Buchloe firm has demon­strated how to deliver  top-quality car cachet through meticulous attention to detail. The BMW  Group is also driven by this same passion for cars that capture the  imagination. That is why we are now embarking on a new chapter in our  long-standing partnership. Acquiring the trademark rights will allow  us to shape the long-term course of this brand steeped in tradition.  We are delighted to welcome the ALPINA brand to the BMW family,” said  Pieter Nota, member of the Board of Management responsible for  Customer, Brands and Sales. The transformation towards electromobility and increasing regulation  worldwide – particularly emissions legislation, software validation  and requirements for driver assistance and monitoring systems – result  in significantly higher risks for small-series manufacturers. The  management of ALPINA Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG is addressing  this with a strategic realignment that will secure the long-term  viability of the Buchloe operations. Andreas Bovensiepen, co-managing director of ALPINA Burkard  Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG, explains: “We recognised the challenges  facing the automotive industry early on and are now setting the right  course for ALPINA and for our family firm, BOVENSIEPEN. This marks the  beginning of a new chapter. Both the ALPINA brand and our company are  extremely desirable. We made a conscious decision not to sell ALPINA  to just any manufacturer, because BMW and ALPINA have worked together  and trusted one another for decades. That is why it is the right  decision strategically for the ALPINA brand to be managed by the BMW  Group in the future.” The cooperation will continue – but in a different form: The company  owned by the Bovensiepen family will continue to use its engineering  expertise in developing, manufacturing, and selling BMW ALPINA  vehicles within the existing cooperation until the end of 2025. This  results in base BMW cars receiving extensive modifi­cation by the  ALPINA team - including the engine and transmission, as well as the  chassis, aerodynamics, and interior equipment. BMW ALPINA vehicles are  pre-assembled on BMW production lines before final assembly of the  vehicles taking place in workshops in Buchloe, also comprising  individual interiors built to customer specifications. The service, parts and accessories business for the existing and  legacy BMW ALPINA vehicle portfolio will continue at the Buchloe  location in the long term. There will be no changes to the existing  aftersales cooperation. As part of a strategic cooperation between the  two companies, there will be a further expansion of the existing  development services business for BMW out of Buchloe. The wine  business that also forms part of the family firm will be unaffected. “BMW and ALPINA are a perfect fit! The ALPINA brand has matured  alongside BMW over the past 50 years and has everything it takes to  make the heart of an automotive connoisseur beat faster all over the  world. It finds the right balance between cultivated sportiness,  luxury, and exclusivity. We are delighted to acquire the trademark  rights to ALPINA and add new vehicle capturing DNA to the BMW  portfolio,” said Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President Customer and  Brand BMW. 2021 was the most successful year in the history of ALPINA Burkard  Bovensiepen GmbH + Co. KG. Building on this strong foundation, the  family business will strategically realign going forwards in order to  address regulatory challenges and technological change in the  industry. This will secure the location of Buchloe for the long term. “We will continue our father’s life’s work and invest in the equally  well-known name of BOVENSIEPEN. With our expertise and high standards  of quality, we will bring other convincing mobile offerings to the  market in the future,” explains co-managing director Florian  Bovensiepen: “Without our creative, highly capable, and loyal  employees, ALPINA’s success story would not have been possible. We are  relying on the strength of our company, our team, and our families to  pivot at the right time. At the same time, we acknowledge, with the  BMW Group, our social responsibility towards our workforce and will do  our best to cushion the potential impact resulting from this reorganisation.” The sale of trademark rights to BMW and the resulting discontinuation  of the current ALPINA vehicle programme at the end of 2025 will have  implications for existing jobs at the Buchloe site. BMW will support  ALPINA with the necessary adjustments to the workforce at the Buchloe  location over the coming years. Up until the end of 2025, BMW will  work with ALPINA to offer those employees who will not be able to  continue working at the Buchloe site a new position with the BMW Group  and also help them find new jobs with suppliers and development partners. ALPINA Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH + Co.

We have known for a number of weeks that Walkenhorst    Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport will each run two BMW M4 GT3s in    the 2022 DTM. It is now time to unveil the designs of the four cars.    Each one bears the colours and logos of long-term BMW M Motorsport    partners who have remained true to the DTM in its GT3 era and play a    valuable role in supporting the BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers    in this prestigious series.BMW M Motorsport thanks CATL, iQOO, PUMA, RoboMarkets,    Schaeffler and Shell.    “The face of the DTM may have changed after the end of the Class 1  era, but it has not lost any of its appeal when it comes to race  action, the impressive number of competitors signed up for this  season, and the high-class field of teams and drivers,” said Timo  Resch, Vice President Customer, Brand and Sales at BMW M GmbH. “I am  thrilled that, as we do, our long-term BMW M Motorsport partners  continue to recognise the huge potential of the DTM platform and have  decided to support the BMW M Motorsport teams – Walkenhorst Motorsport  and Schubert Motorsport – in 2022. I really like all the BMW M4 GT3  designs. They will be real eye-catchers in a large field. Thank you to  all the partners for their support!” Two-time DTM champion Marco Wittmann (GER) will once again be at the  wheel of the ‘Green Machine’ for Walkenhorst Motorsport. The striking  green in the livery has been the trademark of Schaeffler and Wittmann  since the 2019 DTM season. The BMW M4 GT3 now follows in the footsteps  of the BMW M4 DTM and the BMW M6 GT3 as the ‘Green Machine’. His  team-mate at Walkenhorst Motorsport, Esteban Muth (BEL), will drive a  BMW M4 GT3 adorned with the logos of BMW M Motorsport partners CATL  and iQOO. “Schaeffler is looking forward to the continuation of a long and  successful partnership with BMW M Motorsport and, it goes without  saying, to seeing our Schaeffler brand ambassador Marco Wittmann back  on the grid for Walkenhorst Motorsport in the ‘Green Machine’, said  Sören Zinner, Director Sponsoring at Schaeffler. “Nowadays, it is hard  to imagine Schaeffler without the partnership with Marco. We are  certainly expecting an exciting DTM season in the new BMW M4 GT3 with  Schaeffler technology.” As he did in the Class 1 era of the DTM, Sheldon van der Linde again  competes in Shell colours for Schubert Motorsport. As Premium  Technology Partner, Shell was heavily involved in the development of  the BMW M4 GT3. The car driven by van der Linde’s team-mate Philipp  Eng (AUT) features the RoboMarkets livery, which will also be familiar  from the BMW M4 DTM in the Class 1 era. PUMA is Official Supplier of  BMW M Motorsport race wear. “Shell is proud to continue our long-standing Premium Technology  Partnership with BMW M Motorsport in DTM, enabling us to deepen our  R&D collaboration with high-performance at its core”, said Marc  Bittner, Shell’s General Manager European OEMs. “Shell has been  working alongside BMW M Motorsport engineers in DTM to formulate a  Shell Helix Ultra race lubricant for use in the new BMW M4 GT3,  delivering long-lasting and improved engine performance and  efficiency.

{"prompt":" Hydrogen fuel cell technology also enables unrestricted sustainable mobility in extremely low outside temperatures  Integrated application of drive system, chassis and electronics at the BMW Group’s winter testing centre in Arjeplog, Sweden  ->","completion":" Munich\/Arjeplog. The BMW iX5 Hydrogen is currently  undergoing a demanding programme of testing in extremely challenging  weather conditions. It is all part of final winter testing for the car  on public roads and at the BMW Group’s testing centre in Arjeplog,  northern Sweden. The integrated functional testing and validation of  the fuel cell system, hydrogen tanks, peak power battery and central  vehicle control unit have confirmed that this additional  CO2-free mobility option can also be relied on to provide  sustainable driving pleasure with high levels of comfort and  unrestricted performance in extreme sub-zero temperatures.The tests close to the Arctic Circle see the BMW Group pressing ahead  with its development process for the BMW iX5 Hydrogen. The company  will produce a small series of the model later in the year and is also  committed to helping expand the network of hydrogen fuelling stations.  “The winter testing under extreme conditions clearly shows that the  BMW iX5 Hydrogen can also deliver full performance in temperatures of  -20°C and therefore represents a viable alternative to a vehicle  powered by a battery-electric drive system,” says Frank Weber,    Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development.  “For us to be able to offer our customers a fuel cell drive system as  an attractive sustainable mobility solution, a sufficiently extensive  hydrogen infrastructure also needs to be in place.”BMW iX5 Hydrogen: hallmark BMW dynamics, range and everyday    usability all year round.In these test runs on the  ice and snow around Arjeplog, the BMW iX5 Hydrogen is busy  demonstrating how reliably, comfortably and powerfully its hydrogen  fuel cell drive system can already meet the mobility requirements of  everyday life. After racking up hundreds of sessions on test rigs and  in-depth field testing on the road, this adds another chapter to its  development story.The evidence is there for all to see: here, in this extreme cold, the  hydrogen fuel cell drive system displays the same everyday usability  as a conventional internal combustion engine. Full system power  quickly comes on tap. Even in these freezing conditions, the drive  system continues to offer its full operating range. And replenishing  the hydrogen tanks takes only three to four minutes, even in the  depths of winter. “The hydrogen fuel cell drive system combines the  best of both drive worlds, regardless of the time of year and outside  temperatures: it offers the locally emission-free mobility of an  electric vehicle and the unrestricted everyday usability – including  short refuelling stops – familiar from models with an internal  combustion engine,” says Jürgen Guldner, Vice President of    Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology and Vehicle Projects at the BMW Group.The drive system on board the BMW iX5 Hydrogen teams fuel cell  technology with an electric motor using fifth-generation BMW    eDrive technology. The hydrogen it uses as an energy source  is stored in two 700-bar tanks made from carbon-fibre-reinforced  plastic (CFRP). The fuel cell converts the hydrogen into electric  power, generating output of 125 kW\/170 hp. Plus, the electric motor  can add the energy stored in a power battery to the mix. This battery  is charged either through energy recovery or from the fuel cell. All  of which means that system output of 275 kW\/374 hp is  available when the driver decides to explore the upper reaches of the  car’s dynamic abilities. The only emission released by the fuel cell  is water vapour. And its waste heat is harnessed particularly  efficiently to warm the car’s interior.Unique drive system meets all requirements.The  drive, energy storage and control systems all pass the ultimate test  of endurance in the wintery surrounds of Lapland. Added to which,  specially prepared ice surfaces and snow-covered roads offer the  perfect conditions to test the integrated application of all the drive  and chassis systems. This also encompasses the steering, springs and  dampers, as well as the chassis control systems and the interplay of  the friction brakes and deceleration by energy recuperation. Here  again, the BMW iX5 Hydrogen is able to make its strengths count, as it  also weighs less than a comparable battery-electric model.The combination of fuel cell and peak power battery gives the BMW iX5  Hydrogen a globally unique drive system. Its  technology has the potential to add another pillar to the BMW Group’s  drive system portfolio for locally CO2-free mobility. BMW i  – as a brand focused entirely on mobility producing zero local  emissions – could in future offer vehicles with a hydrogen fuel cell  drive system alongside its battery-electric models. This would allow  it, most strikingly, to meet the mobility requirements of customers  who do not have their own access to electric charging infrastructure,  frequently travel long distances or desire a high degree of flexibility.\n"}
{"prompt":" CO2 fleet emissions of 115,9 g\/km (WLTP) in 2021  Major reduction from previous year  Driven by further increases in efficiency for conventional drive technologies and strong demand for electrified vehicles  ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group once again significantly  overfulfilled its European CO2 emissions targets in 2021, continuing  to consistently pursue its path of emission reduction. With emissions  of around 115,9 grams per kilometre, according to WLTP, the company  outperformed the fleet target limit of approx. 126 grams per kilometre  by around ten grams in the EU27+2 (EU, Norway, Iceland), based on its  own internal calculations. CO2 fleet emissions were also further reduced compared to the  previous year: Converted to the WLTP cycle, the reduction was around  14 percent. The key drivers for fulfilment of the fleet target were  significantly higher sales of electrified vehicles in Europe and  further increases in efficiency for conventional drive technologies. The BMW Group already released two very successful fully-electric  vehicles onto the market in 2021, the BMW iX and the BMW i4, for which  demand is exceeding the high expectations. On the European continent,  in particular, there is strong interest in electromobility: In 2021,  more than one in four vehicles in the EU27+2 was either fully electric  or a plug-in hybrid. The success of electromobility can also be seen  from two further milestones the company reached in 2021: For the first  time, a fully-electric vehicle, the MINI Cooper SE*, became the  highest-volume model variant for one of the BMW Group brands. The  company also handed over its one-millionth electrified vehicle to its  new owner in December 2021. The BMW Group aims to sell more than 200,000 fully-electric vehicles  in 2022, at least double its sales in 2021. The launch of two more  fully-electric vehicles from important model series this year, the BMW  i7 and the BMW iX1, will further increase the total number and  percentage of electrified vehicles sold. A highly flexible, integrated  production system that allows combustion-engine vehicles and electric  models to be built on one line is a key enabler for this. In 2022, the  BMW Group will produce at least one fully-electric vehicle at each of  its German plants. In 2021, the BMW Group once again tightened its own goals to  significantly reduce CO2 emissions and also committed to a pathway  that meets the 1.5-degree goal for limiting global warming. The BMW  Group plans to lower lifecycle CO2 emissions per vehicle by at least  40 percent by 2030. The company became the first German automotive  manufacturer to join the Business Ambition for 1.5° C campaign  launched by the Science-Based Targets Initiative and is committed to  the goal of complete climate neutrality throughout the entire value  chain by 2050 at the latest.  *Consumption\/emissions data: MINI Cooper SE: Power consumption in kWh\/100 km  combined: 16.9-14.9 NEDC, 17.6-15.2 WLTP. If you have any questions, please contact: BMW Group Corporate Communications Sebastian Kessler, Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesTelephone: +49 89 382-21616E-mail: Sebastian.KE.Kessler@bmw.de Eckhard Wannieck, Head of Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesTelephone: +49 89 382-24544E-mail: Eckhard.Wannieck@bmwgroup.com Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comE-mail: presse@bmw.de  The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

{"prompt":"In 1962, the British brand achieved its first international rally victory, thanks to the talent and passion of a modern-day heroine of racing: Pat Moss. The new MINI Pat Moss Edition for the MINI 3-door and        MINI 5-door is a tribute to a pioneer, MINI's sporting history and true team spirit. And strong women play a key role in shaping the success of the MINI brand today as well - these are their stories.  ->","completion":" Munich. On International Women's Day 2022, MINI  remembers a legendary female racing driver. Pat Moss made motorsport  history in 1962, scoring the first international rally victory for the  British brand on the prestigious Noordwijk - Monte Carlo - Noordwijk  route, better known as the \"International Tulip Rally\". Her  victory not only kicked off the Classic MINI's unique success story in  rallying, but also caused a sensation in male-dominated racing.  \"Mossie\" and \"Wizz\", as Pat Moss and her co-pilot  Ann Wisdom were called in the racing scene, managed to create facts  that nobody could ignore. At a time when gender roles were  predetermined, these two women unceremoniously defined them  themselves. 60 years later, society has taken some decisive steps  forward. And more than ever, strong women at MINI are shaping the  success and image of the British premium brand.Stefanie Wurst has been in charge of the MINI brand since February  2022. With her experience in holistic business management and her  intercultural background, she is determined to electrify the British  premium brand and strengthen the issue of sustainability. \"It is  the very idea of MINI to make economical use of resources and  available space. The small ecological footprint is already in MINI's  genes, so to speak. When it comes to sustainability, our customers  need to know what we are doing and why, so that they can make a  conscious decision,\" says Stefanie Wurst about her approach. For  her, sustainable corporate governance also includes values such as  diversity, tolerance and openness. \"It's not about favouring  certain groups, it's about building a modern team that reflects and  understands the changing global communities well. A modern brand must  be meaningful, positive and constantly evolving.\"  Jennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod is accompanying this realignment as Head  of Communications for MINI and BMW Motorrad. For her, diversity and  equal opportunities are part of MINI's recipe for success: \"We  clearly see diversity as a strength - both within and outside our  organisation - the appropriate makeup of our teams in all areas is a  key factor in the creativity, innovation and ultimately success of the  MINI brand.\"With her talent, courage and passion, Pat Moss in the Classic MINI  left the male competition behind her - and many an established role  model along as well. Now a special edition bears the name of the rally  driver who died in 2008. The Pat Moss Edition for the MINI Cooper S  3-door (combined fuel consumption: 6.6 – 6.2 l\/100 km; combined CO2  emissions: 151 – 140 g\/km according to WLTP) and the MINI John Cooper  Works (combined fuel consumption: 7.1 – 6.8 l\/100 km; combined CO2  emissions: 162 – 156 g\/km WLTP) and the MINI Cooper S 5-door (combined  fuel consumption: 6.8 – 6.2 l\/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 154 -  141 g\/km according to WLTP) will arrive at dealers in May 2022 -  exactly 60 years after its triumph in the Netherlands. Its design reflects both the brand's racing tradition and the  personal history of Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom, and also integrates MINI  product innovations such as the Multitone Roof. \"When there is  already a strong story, as with the Pat Moss Edition, it is a pleasure  to define the details, combine the elements that underline this story,  choose the right colour combination and decide where to place the  design features,\" says Morgane Bavagnoli, the MINI designer responsible.  Her own story at MINI began in 2010 with an internship in Munich,  which she was thrilled with right from the start and which was to  shape her career. Almost 10 years later and after working at  Designworks and BMW, Morgane Bavagnoli returned to the MINI design  team. Among other things, she was responsible for the colour concept  of the MINI Electric Pacesetter. Most recently, for example, she also  developed the design of the décor and interior surfaces for the MINI  Countryman in the \"Untamed Edition\". Her heart beats for  surprising details that even MINI fans may only notice at second  glance. For example, the main symbol of the MINI Pat Moss Edition -  the graphic of a tulip, which can be seen discreetly but unmistakably  in many places. It is these special details with which designers like  Morgane emphasise the individual character of a MINI and contribute to  the success of the brand. \"Being a designer at MINI is something  special. The opportunity to get involved in completely different  projects and work at different levels - from pre-development and  research to concept cars and series implementation - is always  refreshing,\" says Morgane Bavagnoli about her personal drive.Telling stories like Pat Moss's is also Lina Fischer's passion. In  the MINI Editorial Office, she works on editorial marketing and the  MINI Insider magazine. She has been part of MINI since 2010. The  editorial production around the Pat Moss Edition focused on female  empowerment in several respects. A female photographer, an editor and  two female drivers for the action scenes on the road worked together  for the shoot and staged the edition, which was largely designed by  women. \"I am proud to have worked on this project together in a  team with such strong and inspiring women,\" says Lina Fischer.Verena Markart, Product Manager at MINI, also appreciates this kind  of inspiration in her work. For her, the MINI community in particular  is always a key driver in her work.  \"Unconventional, versatile,  creative and self-determined personalities, for whom community and new  experiences are important, motivate me every day\" For her, the  rally victory commemorated by the Pat Moss Edition is linked to the  attitude that still applies to MINI today: “Born to compete”. The  motto rounds off the Quick Facts about the legendary Tulip Rally,  which are listed below the side scuttles on the front side walls: from  the route Noordwijk - Monte Carlo - Noordwijk, to the distance of  2,500 kilometres and the vehicle, the Mini Cooper, to its starting  number 104.\"MINI stands for thinking things differently, and that's what I  love about our brand,\" says Yvonne Schrader, who heads up brand  management, communications management and artwork at MINI. \"I  associate Pat Moss' success above all with the motto \"Only MINI  can do\", turning dreams into action. Mossie\" and  \"Wizz\" already had this mindset. They dared to do the  extraordinary instead of just talking about it.\"With British understatement, co-driver Ann Wisdom later recalled the  success in the Classic MINI: \"We didn't see ourselves as pioneers  back then, we simply drove a rally.\" The MINI team firmly  believes that diversity is a strength. A team of players with  different backgrounds and personalities is crucial - friction is where  new ideas, solutions, products and services for the MINI brand are  continuously created. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Spokesperson Product Communications  MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com\n"}

And the  foundation for all this was laid by an exceptional female driver. In  May 1962, the classic Mini was added to the list of winners of an  international rally event for the first time. In the international  Tulip Rally – from the Dutch municipality of Noordwijk to the French  Riviera and back again – Pat Moss achieved the best time over the  distance in the classic Mini Cooper. 60 years later, MINI celebrates  the talent, courage and passion of this British woman racing driver  with a fascinating special edition. The Pat Moss Edition of the MINI  3-door and MINI 5-door, limited to just over 800 vehicles, not only  commemorates the launch of the classic Mini’s extraordinary sporting  career, it also marks a pioneering achievement for female power in  motorsports. Success in the Netherlands turned the classic Mini, Pat  Moss and her co-driver Ann Wisdom into enduring heroines in a  discipline otherwise dominated by significantly larger vehicles and  entirely the preserve of men.Unconventional design features and stylish details characterise the  Pat Moss Edition, which will be available from May 2022 for the MINI  Cooper S 3-door (combined consumption: 6.6 – 6.2 l\/100 km; combined  CO2 emissions: 151 – 140 g\/km according to WLTP) and, the  MINI Cooper S 5-door (combined fuel consumption: 6.8 – 6.2 l\/100 km;  combined CO2 emissions: 154 – 141 g\/km according to WLTP) and the MINI  John Cooper Works (combined fuel consumption: 7.1 – 6.8 l\/100 km;  combined CO2 emissions: 162 – 156 g\/km according to WLTP).

The exclusive design of the  edition models cites the racing history of the British premium brand  as well as the sporting careers of Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom.It also incorporates MINI product innovations such as the Multitone  Roof. What is more, an additional variant of the Multitone Roof is  available for the first time in the Pat Moss Edition. The colour  gradient of the vehicle roof extends from Chilli Red to Melting Silver  and Jet Black. With the innovative paint finishing process fully  integrated in production at the MINI plant in Oxford, this will be the  first time a second colour variant has been realised. It will be  available for customers to order from March 2022. Minimal deviations  in the colour pattern caused by changing environmental conditions  ensure that every MINI with a Multitone Roof has the character of a  unique specimen ex works. On the new edition models, the charismatic  roof paintwork is combined with the body finishes Pepper White or  Midnight Black metallic and also red exterior mirror caps.A stylised tulip symbolises the first rally victory: it appears on  the C pillars and side scuttles of the edition vehicles along with the  inscription “Pat Moss”. The wheel hub covers also feature an exclusive  design with a graphic which is based on the outline of the typical  Dutch flower and the MINI wordmark.The key facts of the 1962 Tulip Rally appear below the side scuttles  on the front side panels: the route Noordwijk – Monte Carlo –  Noordwijk, the distance of 2 500 kilometres, the vehicle, namely a  Mini Cooper, and its starting number 104. These are supplemented with  the slogan that still applies to MINI to this day: “born to compete”.  The tulip motif, the name inscription and the key facts about the  first every rally win are also to be found on the screen-printed  aluminium door sill trims designed exclusively for the edition model.Another design element used for the first time in the Pat Moss  Edition is the horizontally aligned bonnet stripe in white. The  printed combination of three-dimensional numbers and letters – 737 ABL  – is the registration number of the classic Mini that won the 1962  Tulip Rally, likewise recalling the historical model. Meanwhile the  original signature that Pat Moss wrote on the bonnet of her car after  one of her victories adorns the front apron of the edition model as a  graphic imprint.In the interior of the edition vehicles, the iconic signature on the  Piano Black interior surface in the passenger area is another tribute  to the revolutionary woman rally driver, who passed away in 2008. The  sports leather steering wheel bears the edition emblem in the form of  a tulip graphic which appears on the clip of the lower spoke. The  abstract depiction of engine pistons moving up and down serves as the  motif for a graphic on the interior surface on the driver’s side. With  bars of different heights forming the shape of the letters “M” and “W”  – standing for “Moss” and “Wisdom” – they symbolise that perfectly  coordinated duo that caused a sensation in the rally scene for so many years.The MINI Pat Moss Edition is a tribute to a female racing pioneer,  MINI’s rally history and true team spirit. One of the remarkable  details of the first rally triumph for the classic Mini is the fact  that Ann Wisdom insisted on taking part in the Tulip Rally despite  being pregnant at the time: she went on to provide her team mate Pat  Moss with unerring navigation guidance over the 2 500 kilometre route.Mossie and Wizz – as they were known in the paddock – formed a  successful duo for seven years. The two women had the courage to  compete in a male-dominated sport – and they brought about fundamental  changes, too. The younger sister of Formula 1 driver Stirling Moss,  Pat Moss also won the Sestriere Rally in Italy in 1968, achieved a  podium finish in numerous other international competitions and was  crowned European Ladies’ Rally Champion five times. Ann Wisdom is  considered the first professional woman co-driver in the history of  rallying. As successful sportswomen in their own right, the two viewed  their courageous foray into a male-dominated domain with typical  British understatement. “We didn’t see ourselves as pioneers back  then,” said Ann Wisdom years later. “We were just entering a rally.”Pat Moss and Ann Wisdom paved the way for an extraordinary career for  the classic Mini. In 1964, 1965 and 1967, the British small car  secured outright victory in the Monte Carlo Rally. Decades later, MINI  became the dominant brand in the world’s toughest endurance rally,  achieving overall victory in the Dakar Rally four times in a row from  2012 to 2015. Two more overall victories followed in 2020 and 2021. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Spokesperson Product Communications  MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com\n"}

The investment includes more than 200 new jobs.  The announcement was made by BMW Manufacturing President and CEO  Robert Engelhorn at the South Carolina Automotive Summit in  Greenville, SC. The new press shop, which will start production in the summer of  2024, will take raw coils of steel, cut them into blanks, and stamp  sheet metal parts for BMW X models. Those components include hang-on  parts such as the vehicle’s four doors, fenders, exterior body sides,  and lift gate. “The BMW Group is known worldwide for the outstanding quality  produced by its press shops. We are excited to add this new technology  to Plant Spartanburg,” said Engelhorn. “This investment reinforces BMW  Group’s commitment in the United States and South Carolina. We  continue to play a major role in the region’s economic strength as  well as workforce development and job training.”  Highly-Skilled Manufacturing JobsA state-of-the-art press shop requires manufacturing jobs with  advanced-level training. These jobs include tool and die technicians,  electrical and mechanical maintenance for automated machinery, and  specialized line operators. More than 45 Plant Spartanburg associates  are currently training at BMW Group press shops in Leipzig, Germany,  and Swindon, UK. These associates also train with partners from the  Schuler Group, that manufactures automated servo press lines for all  BMW Group plants. While Schuler will manufacture the automated press line, all tooling  for Plant Spartanburg’s press shop will come from BMW tool shops in  Eisenach, Munich, and Dingolfing.  Since 1992, the BMW Group has invested nearly $12 billion in its  South Carolina factory. BMW Manufacturing is the largest BMW Group  plant in the world, producing more than 1,500 vehicles each day and  433,810 vehicles in 2021, a record. The factory has an annual  production capacity of up to 450,000 vehicles and employs more than  11,000 people. \n"}

Production of BMW X5 continues at Plant Spartanburg.  ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is stepping up its long-term  involvement in China at the same time as continuing to expand  production capacity for the globally successful BMW X5. An additional  variant of the Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) developed and produced  exclusively for the Chinese market will soon be rolling off the  production line of the BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. Dadong plant in  Shenyang following a major expansion of the joint venture’s facility.  This will mark the first time that executive-segment BMW X models have  been manufactured in China. Set to be available in China from April  2022, the BMW X5 xDrive30Li (fuel consumption combined: 8.9 l\/100 km  [31.7 mpg imp] as per WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 213 g\/km as per  WLTP) and BMW X5 xDrive40Li (fuel consumption combined: 9.3 l\/100 km  [30.4 mpg imp] as per WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 222 g\/km as per  WLTP) boast an exceptionally spacious rear passenger compartment and  exclusive equipment features.The BMW X5 will continue to be produced for the USA and export  worldwide at BMW Group Plant Spartanburg in the US state of South  Carolina, previously the sole manufacturing facility for the SAV. The  capacity freed up as a result of the start of production in Shenyang  will be immediately utilised to meet the high demand for the X models  in the U.S. and across global markets. Plant Spartanburg is the  largest facility in the BMW Group’s worldwide production network and  the centre of competence for BMW X models. The plant produces the two  best-selling BMW models in the US – the BMW X5 and X3 – among others  and will also begin manufacture of the first high-performance hybrid  electric model from BMW M GmbH, the BMW XM, towards the end of 2022.With the introduction of the new models for China and production at  theBMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. joint venture, the BMW Group is  responding to the sustained growth in global demand for the BMW X5.A team of engineers based at the BMW Group’s Munich HQ, as well as  Spartanburg and Shenyang worked closely together on the development of  the new BMW X5 xDrive30Li and BMW X5 xDrive40Li. Preparation for  production was also a joint effort. The outcome is two variants of the  SAV which combine the brand’s signature driving pleasure and the  hallmark versatility of BMW X models with unrivalled space in the  second row and commensurately high levels of passenger comfort.In keeping with the motto “made in China, for China”, the BMW X5  model variants manufactured in Shenyang cater perfectly to the  preferences of customers in the world’s largest car market. Their  wheelbase has been extended by 130 millimetres compared to US-built  BMW X5 models, all of this extra length is used to enhance seating  comfort and legroom for second-row passengers. What is more, occupants  in the rear are able to get in and out with exceptional ease thanks to  the long rear doors. Standard specification for the new models has  also been tailored precisely to the requirements of Chinese customers,  comprising features such as specially designed comfort seats and four  degrees of extra backrest tilt for the rear seats, a panoramic glass  sunroof, ambient lighting as well as a bespoke M Aerodynamics package.  Meanwhile, an electroplated finish for selected controls, speakers  with perforated metal covers and a newly designed smartphone tray with  inductive charging create a modern, premium ambience inside the cabin.The specially tuned chassis technology, including electronically  controlled dampers as standard and – optionally on the new  BMW X5 xDrive40Li – two-axle air suspension with automatic  self-levelling, strikes the perfect balance between sportiness and  comfort. There is a choice of two efficient petrol engines featuring  BMW TwinPower Turbo technology (four-cylinder engine with new  BMW X5 xDrive30Li, six-cylinder in-line engine with new  BMW X5 xDrive40Li) whose power is directed to the road via an  eight-speed Steptronic transmission and the BMW xDrive intelligent  all-wheel-drive system.\n"}
{"prompt":" Cloud-based software suite for worldwide edge device management  Central app catalogue rolled out in the BMW Group production network  Zero-touch installation for fully automated setup   ->","completion":" Cloud-based software suite for worldwide edge device management   Central app catalogue rolled out in the BMW Group production  network  Zero-touch installation for fully automated setup  Munich. The BMW Group’s Edge Ecosystem has won the  Microsoft Intelligent Manufacturing Award 2021 in the Envision  category. The cloud-based software suite allows production-related  applications (apps) on edge devices to be distribut-ed, configured and  administered worldwide. This means software innovations can now be  rolled out efficiently by users themselves without deviating from  standard-ised business processes.The Edge Ecosystem significantly reduces the effort involved in the  manual man-agement of many thousands of devices around the world. It  also helps prevent faulty configurations from causing production  shutdowns and saves on maintenance costs.  These advantages make the  innovative Edge Ecosystem a key driver in the digitalisation of the  entire BMW Group production system.Because it is open and uses standard IT technologies, the Edge  Ecosystem also allows external partners and suppliers to integrate  their hard- and software compo-nents around the world into the BMW  Group’s production system – efficiently and without special  adjustments. Fast hardware integration is enabled by a zero-touch  installer that integrates new edge devices into the ecosystem fully  automatically and without user input. Increasing efficiency and cutting downtimes in production. App configuration is managed centrally by the cloud platform and  allows hot-swapping – which is particularly important for production.  So if an edge device fails, it takes just a matter of minutes to load  the complete application and configuration onto a new device. This  reduces downtimes in production to a minimum and elimi-nates the need  for separate, complex backup management. Worldwide distribution of AI models.The BMW Group’s Edge Ecosystem is already in use in several  applications world-wide. In production, it connects the cameras and  edge devices of specialised deep learning models used for inline  quality assurance. It also allows image data, which undergoes  application-specific processing locally, to be managed and offers the  necessary flexibility for the agile exchange of AI models.The Edge Ecosystem is being used in the press shop as well. Here,  sheet metal must be oiled before being formed, but the amount of  lubrication required depends on a range of factors, such as storage  time. To ensure the optimum amount of lu-brication, a deep-learning  model was developed that transmits the lubrication pa-rameters for  each sheet to the machine and controls the system in real time. The  model has been distributed and is constantly updated in the BMW Group  Edge Ecosystem as an application for BMW Group presses around the  world so that only as much oil is used as necessary. Retrofitting to existing systems.The Edge Ecosystem can also be used to update existing systems so  that they too can work with modern applications in the cloud. This is  done by installing a special gateway software on an edge device in the  system which then converts its data into cloud-compatible formats. For  example, the technology is being used to integrate loading machines  and fire doors into the network of autonomous transport systems in logistics. Edge Ecosystem wins award.The value-adding impact the BMW Group Edge Ecosystem will have on  future production has now been confirmed by an independent source. The  system has now scooped the Microsoft Intelligent Manufacturing Award  2021 pre-sented by Microsoft and Roland Berger, in the Envision category.\n"}

When the 50th anniversary of the founding of  BMW M GmbH takes place on 24 May, the celebrations will already be in  full swing. Celebrations for the anniversary kick off on 24 February  with a unique event: in a film, various BMW M vehicles along with  their drivers get together for a huddle. This kind of huddle for  coordinating strategies, motivating and cheering each other on is  known from almost every team sport. It is impressively staged with  many BMW M models.The film about this most sporting of gatherings shows in a very  emotional way what the international BMW M community is all about.  However different the vehicles and their people might be – they all  love the accelerated heartbeat and the goose bumps that every BMW M  triggers. Excited and enthusiastic as they are, they go their own way,  are courageous and take a stance. What unites them is the passion for  that special feeling every driver of a BMW M experiences. They all  feel: WE ARE M.“We are proud of the roaring start to our anniversary year on 24  February. The film “Huddle Speech” is in the tradition of  extraordinary films for BMW M, but is nevertheless different: it  heralds our transformation. We are looking ahead, but continuing to  create a feeling of home that defines the great BMW M fanbase,” says  Timo Resch, Head of Customer, Brand, Sales at BMW M GmbH. “We want to  celebrate with all the fans, with our international community,  therefore we have surprises in store for all communication channels,  all year round. We are really looking forward to it.”WE ARE M stands for everything that was and will continue to be.The claim created especially for the anniversary year shows the  sentiment of the campaign: BMW M is exceedingly multifaceted, always  appearing different and new, but instantly recognisable. From the M1  Procar and the i4 M50 to the XM Concept: BMW M is defined by a true  firework of vehicles. What unites them, despite all their differences,  is this main characteristic: being BMW M, thus always different,  unique and edgy – which is exactly what the campaign picks up on.The 50 Years campaign is divided into four chapters, each of which is  activated over a period of one quarter. Whilst the first chapter, the  “Huddle Speech”, heralds the basic theme of 50 years of BMW M, the  second will be predominantly about BMW M's 50-year motorsport history.  The third chapter deals with electrification, while the fourth focuses  on the unique lifestyle. During the course of the year, BMW M GmbH  will present a host of spectacular new vehicles. In addition, the  brand will present itself at numerous major international events. The  recently unveiled “BMW Motorsport Anniversary Emblem” is just one of  many more surprises for the global BMW M community.With its heritage, BMW M is setting its sights on the future.The holistic communication on the occasion of the 50th anniversary  also takes a look back at the unparalleled history of BMW M GmbH  experiences, achievements and successes in the performance and  high-performance segment. One example of this is the digital campaign  “Only in M Town” from the year 2018, which, even at that time, gave  BMW M enthusiasts the feeling to be at home.But BMW M does not rest on its laurels. It utilises this strength for  its future transformation. As the next three chapters of the campaign  already imply, BMW M is oriented towards new performance,  electrification and the typical BMW M lifestyle. Because BMW M is and  will remain the Ultimate Driving Machine. After half a century and in  the future. Link to the campaign film:https:\/\/youtu.be\/Jt_JL29K6Us\n"}

As a modern interpretation of the classic  shooting brake concept, the MINI Clubman clearly stands apart from its  competitors in the premium compact segment. This status is reflected  in its individual body concept and stylish understatement and is now  brought to bear to even greater effect in the Untold Edition. Its  specific design features and a body finish in Sage Green metallic –  available for the first time in the MINI Clubman – lend a charismatic  look to the edition model, which will be available from March 2022.Added to this are exclusive indications of hallmark driving pleasure,  which in the case of the MINI John Cooper Works Clubman (combined fuel  consumption: 7.9 – 7.4 l\/100 km; combined CO2 emissions:  180 – 168 g\/km according to WLTP) in the Untold Edition authentically  emphasise the athletic power of its engine.

In addition, the viewers can help their  favorite ensemble to win the audience award.On March 8, the German ensemble Julia    Hülsmann Trio will kick off this year’s BMW Welt Jazz  Award. Berlin-based pianist Hülsmann is one of the selected German  musicians “who give fresh impetus to the world of European jazz”, said  the jury of SWR Jazz Award as early as 2016. Hülsmann first made her  mark with lyrical interpretations for the label ACT in collaboration  with prominent vocalists such as Rebekka Bakken, Anna Lauvergnac and  Roger Cicero. Since moving to ECM in 2008, she has to date released  seven albums, all featuring her inimitable, delicate and completely  pared-down performances on the piano interpreting her own  compositions. At the heart of each project is her trio with bassist  Marc Muellbauer and drummer Heinrich Köbberling, which has performed  in this constellation for 20 years. This year, the current awardee of  the German Jazz Prize and her trio will be on stage at the BMW Welt  Jazz Award.For the second concert on March 22, BMW Welt will be  host to the Jacob Karlzon Trio. Swedish musician  Jacob Karlzon counts among the outstanding jazz pianists coming out of  Scandinavia in recent years. Following a long period as accompanist of  vocalist Viktoria Tolstoy, Karlzon made his name on the international  stage with numerous projects of his own. Combining his passion for  improvisation with unexpected rock rhythms and an open style  characteristic to Scandinavian jazz, he prefers the term “alternative  artist” to jazz pianist. True to his own style, Karlzon’s albums to  date show influences from Ravel to hard bop, from metal to EDM, merged  effortlessly by his preference for minimalist melodies. He is  currently in Munich, promoting his new album “Wanderlust”, released by  Warner and featuring the trio’s other members, bassist Morten Ramsbøl  and drummer Rasmus Kihlberg.Evening concerts of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2022March 8, 2022         Julia Hülsmann TrioMarch 22, 2022       Jacob Karlzon TrioApril 5, 2022            Anat Fort TrioApril 12, 2022         Giovanni Guidi QuintetApril 19, 2022         Marco Mezquida Trio April 26, 2022         Ashley Henry QuartetThe concerts in the Double Cone of BMW Welt are offered free of  charge; however, seating is limited and cannot be guaranteed.

The level of well-being in the interior of the  purely electrically powered luxury sedan is largely determined by the  degree to which disturbing noises can be kept away from the occupants.  There are a variety of potential noise sources to be taken into  account here, so near-production prototypes of the BMW i7 – and indeed  all other model variants of the future BMW 7 Series – undergo an  extensive programme as part of their acoustic testing.At the Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ) in Munich, test and  development engineers check the full range of the vehicle’s sound  emissions and immissions. Motor and rolling noise are analysed in  detail, as are the aeroacoustics and vibration comfort, in order to  fully determine the acoustic properties of the new luxury sedans. This  also includes precise alignment of acoustic pedestrian protection and  the motor sound emitted in the interior of the BMW i7 – the latter  having been developed as part of BMW IconicSounds Electric, a  collaborative venture between the BMW Group and Hollywood film music  composer Hans Zimmer.The driver of the BMW i7 has a choice: characteristic silence    or BMW IconicSounds Electric developed in collaboration with Hans Zimmer.The acoustic test benches at the new branch of the BMW Group’s  Research and Innovation Centre FIZ North are specially designed to  meet the requirements of electromobility and enable all driving  situations to be simulated realistically. Here, any irritating noises  registered by development engineers during test drives on the road can  be recreated and selectively eliminated. Roller dynamometers with a  unique quiescent level and interchangeable surface coverings enable  the measurement and validation of drive acoustics and tyre noise on  all road surfaces that are relevant to day-to-day traffic anywhere in  the world.The BMW i7 aspires to redefine the high standards of the luxury  segment – and this very much applies to acoustic comfort as well.  Great importance was attached to noiseless power delivery of the  electric motor. Contributing factors here include acoustic  optimisation of the electric drive units, a model-specific mount  concept and a newly developed noise encapsulation for the electric  motors. Taken together, these measures enable the BMW i7 to achieve  effective acoustic decoupling across a wide frequency range, thereby  ensuring maximum acoustic comfort in the interior in all driving  situations. As a result, the driver of the purely electrically powered  luxury sedan always has the choice of enjoying either the  characteristic silence of the motor or the emotionally powerful BMW  IconicSounds Electric developed in collaboration with Hans Zimmer.Increased body rigidity at the front end and tyres with a foam  absorber on the inside for integrated noise insulation likewise help  raise the acoustic and vibration comfort of the new luxury sedans to  an outstanding level.Acoustic testing on the climatic test bench and in the wind tunnel.In order to be able to test the effectiveness of all measures under  extreme climatic conditions too, the development engineers at FIZ  North use an acoustic climate test bench specially designed for this  purpose. Here, all globally relevant conditions can be simulated and a  wide variety of noise sources can be analysed and optimised such as  the acoustics of the air conditioning and ventilation system  throughout the entire vehicle – in particular at very low or very high temperatures.In the same way as the motor and tyre rolling acoustics, ambient  noise can also be selectively reduced. For this purpose, the  aeroacoustics of the BMW i7 are perfected in the acoustic wind tunnel.  Clear-cut body surfaces, flush-integrated door handles,  aerodynamically optimised exterior mirrors and an almost completely  closed underbody not only contribute to the low air resistance of the  luxury sedan, they also help create its excellent acoustics.Innovative materials for optimised sound insulation.In addition to the noise and vibrations emanating from the vehicle  itself, it is primarily the noise sources from the outside that can  impair the experience of comfort while driving. The new acoustic  simulator at FIZ North enables the noise emitted in day-to-day traffic  to be simulated under laboratory conditions – this includes the sounds  made at road construction sites and by passing trucks, for example.  Numerous loudspeakers are used to project these sounds onto the  vehicle prototypes from all directions to test the effectiveness of  the interior noise insulation.Highly effective and also weight-optimised sound insulation is  enabled by the use of innovative materials developed in conjunction  with acoustic lightweight construction. One of the ways in which  outstanding shielding of external and intrinsic noise is achieved is  by means of sound absorbers incorporated in the pillar trim, seats,  roof liner and rear shelf. Together with the comfort glazing, which  prevents unwelcome noise from entering through the window panes, this  adds the final touch of perfection to the customer experience. There  are also fleece elements in the doors and on the sill and wheel arch  trim which reduce rolling noise, thereby maximising the experience of comfort.Intense testing of electromagnetic compatibility.With their detailed analyses and precise optimisation, the  development and test engineers seek to ensure that the new luxury  sedans offer the best comfort experience ever realised in a BMW. This  also includes an analysis of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). In  the so-called EMC absorber hall at the FIZ, prototypes of the new  luxury sedans are exposed to powerful electromagnetic fields so as to  test the susceptibility of their electrical systems to interference  and see how they interact with the environment.The test engineers are able to analyse the diagnostic results  transmitted from the vehicle in real time via fibre optic cables. The  test programme in the EMC absorber hall enables comprehensive  protection of the entire vehicle, ensuring absolutely reliable  functioning of the suspension control and assistance systems and  interference-free reception of online data, telephone, radio, TV and  navigation signals.\n"}
{"prompt":" Rotterdam’s OMA and Copenhagen’s 3XN architects chosen as winners  Successful approaches to outstanding, sustainable production in the urban environment of Munich  ->","completion":" Munich. The winners of the BMW Munich – Urban  Production architecture competition for outstanding, future-proof  production at the home plant in Munich have been decided. The jury of  the international contest voted unanimously in favour of designs by  Rotterdam’s OMA and Copenhagen’s 3XN architects. After a day and a  half of intense deliberation, they concluded that the winning  solutions of both practices were of the same high standard. Both had  interpreted the task very well and convinced the jury with their  different focal points. All six of the participating projects from  international architecture practices were of excellent quality and had  offered various solutions for successfully integrating innovative,  sustainable, competitive production into an urban environment. “The two first prizes have gone to projects with quite different  winning characteristics. Both harbour major potential for a masterplan  that meets the needs of the special, inner-city environment of BMW  Plant Munich and will ready it for the future,” said Dieter Reiter,  Lord Mayor of Munich. “Our industry is in the middle of the transformation to  electromobility, digitalisation and circularity, a transformation made  possible by our employees. Creating the perfect environment for them  to perform, identify with our company and experience valuable  encounters is fundamental to our success – today and in the future.   But we are also a part of the social system around us and take  responsibility for the development of our urban environment. Together  with our stakeholders, we are developing a masterplan that will offer  a long-term perspective to people inside and outside the plant. Our  aim is to create a progressive environment for work and production  that focuses firmly on sustainability, urban planning, transport and  logistics, as well as the local neighbourhood,” said Ilka Horstmeier,  BMW AG Board Member for HR and Labour Relations Director. “To mark its centenary, we are shaping the future of our home plant  with a top-class architecture competition – a strong commitment by the  BMW Group to this unique plant in the middle of Munich,” said Milan  Nedeljković, BMW AG Board Member for Production. “The winning designs  by OMA and 3XN are convincing, forward-looking proposals that coincide  with our own vision for an innovative and integrative working world.  As the transformation to electromobility continues, production at BMW  is becoming more efficient, flexible, digital and sustainable than ever.” The aim of the BMW Munich – Urban Production planning competition was  to find a design that is both functional and convincing in terms of  urban development. The focus should be on efficient, competitive  production on the one hand and embedding the plant into its urban  environment on the other. The BMW Group will now join forces with the  award-winners to further their proposals develop, so that the company  can benefit as fully as possible from the various opportunities of the  different approaches and their synergies, and to develop a coherent,  forward-looking masterplan. Members of the juryThe members of the award jury were: Dieter Reiter, Lord Mayor of  Munich; BMW AG Board Members Ilka Horstmeier and Dr. Milan  Nedeljković; Prof. Elisabeth Merk, Planning Director of the City of  Munich; Michael Hardi, Head of Planning of the City of Munich; various  renowned architects, landscape architects, transport planners, and  further representatives of the Munich City Council. OMA OFFICE FOR METROPOLITAN ARCHITECTURE OMA is an international practice operating in the field of  architecture and urbanism. AMO, a research and design studio, applies  architectural thinking to domains beyond architecture.Rem Koolhaas founded OMA in 1975 together with Elia and Zoe Zenghelis  and Madelon Vriesendorp. He is also a professor at Harvard University  and at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing.Today, OMA is led by eight partners – Rem Koolhaas, Reinier de Graaf,  Ellen van Loon, Shohei Shigematsu, Iyad Alsaka, Chris van Duijn, Jason  Long, and Managing Partner-Architect David Gianotten – and maintains  offices in Rotterdam, New York, Hong Kong, Doha, and Australia.OMA-designed buildings currently under construction are the  renovation of Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe) in Berlin, The Factory in  Manchester, Hangzhou Prism, the CMG Times Center in Shenzhen and the  Simone Veil Bridge in Bordeaux.OMA was supported by Vogt Landschaftsarchitekten GmbH, Berlin,  Systematica S.r.l., Mailand, Transsolar Energietechnik GmbH, Munich,  Ingenieursgesellschaft Prof. Dr. Sieker mbH, Hoppegarten,  knippershelbig GmbH, Berlin and Büro Stanek, Berlin.3XN3XN was founded in 1986 and has more than 30  years of experience in creating cultural, office and residential  environments, which positively affect behaviour, productivity and  social interaction. In 2007, 3XN extended with a research and  innovation department “GXN Innovation”, who’s research and prime  services in Behavioural-, Circular-, and Parametric design channels  directly into 3XN’s designs and strategies to meet the challenges of  the 21st century. The synergy between 3XN and GXN - between Practice  and Research - not only allows us to design some of the most  sustainable buildings in the world. We design buildings that place  users at the heart of our designs, with the intention to foster  well-being and social dynamics across age, culture and background. 3XN we believes that “architecture shapes behaviour”. This philosophy  is a fundamental pillar in 3XN design approach, as 3XN believes that  Architecture can positively shape people’s behaviour for learning. 3XN  approach is that new buildings should add new and positive qualities  to their environment, the wider area and the brief in order to unlock  potentials for social interaction and interdisciplinary work. Driven  from a Scandinavian approach, 3XN has grown to employ more 180  architects and researchers from 25 different nationalities, who have  local and international experience. 3XN holds offices in Copenhagen  (HQ), Sydney, New York, London and Stockholm, of which their global  capacity gives them the ability to design buildings from a global best  practice, while respecting local cultures and new perspectives.3XN was supported by Latz + Partner LandschaftsArchitekten  Stadtplaner, Kranzberg,  WSP Germany, Munich, GXN, Kopenhagen and  Harald Niemöller Prüfgesellschaft, Munich. If you have any questions, please contact: Corporate CommunicationsHanns Huber, Communications Production Network BMW GroupMobile:   +49-151-601-31181Mail: hanns.ha.huber@bmw.deInternet: www.press.bmwgroup.com\/deutschlandE-mail: presse@bmwgroup.com Die BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Walkenhorst Motorsport and Schubert Motorsport are the    two BMW M Motorsport teams which will compete with the new BMW M4    GT3 in the 2022 DTM season. They will run a total of four cars, with    the three BMW M Motorsport works drivers Marco Wittmann (GER),    Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Philipp Eng (AUT) among those at the    wheel. The season kicks off with the opening weekend from 29th April    to 1st May at Portimão, Portugal. Walkenhorst Motorsport will contest its second season in  the DTM in 2022. The team from Melle (GER) started last year with a  BMW M6 GT3, claiming two victories and a total of five podiums with  two-time DTM champion Wittmann. Walkenhorst Motorsport now competes  with two new BMW M4 GT3s, with Wittmann again behind the wheel. The  second car will be driven by Walkenhorst driver Esteban Muth (BEL). Schubert Motorsport has also been running BMW M  Motorsport race cars in various international championships for many  years. The Oschersleben (GER) team is now set for its DTM debut with  two BMW M4 GT3s. In van der Linde and Eng, Schubert Motorsport also  has two drivers with a wealth of DTM and GT3 experience in the cockpit. Quotes. Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH: “The DTM is  an important platform, which sets benchmarks – not only in terms of  the actual racing, but with its overall presence.

We are looking forward to an exciting 2022 DTM season with  Walkenhorst Motorsport, Schubert Motorsport and the new BMW M4 GT3!” Henry Walkenhorst, Team Principal Walkenhorst  Motorsport: “We are delighted to be able to confirm our  involvement in the DTM and the DTM Trophy alongside BMW for the coming  years. After the positive impact we made in 2021, with two race wins  and several podium finishes, we are confident that we can back up that  success with our new spearhead, the BMW M4 GT3. We are proud to line  up with two cars this year. With Mega-Marco and Overtaker-Esteban, we  have found the perfect combination for our team. The faith being put  in us by BMW and our sponsors motivates the whole team to do  everything in its power to achieve the big goal. We are looking  forward to the 2022 DTM, hopefully with plenty of fans at the circuit.” Torsten Schubert, Team Principal Schubert  Motorsport: “Entering the DTM is another milestone for  Schubert Motorsport, and one which I, and the whole team, are very  proud. It is one of the most attractive racing series in the world,  and its name has always been synonymous with professional racing of  the highest standard. The attributes required match our personal  approach, with which we have been competing at the racetracks of this  world for more than two decades. Since I first watched the DTM in  Wunstorf almost 30 years ago, I have been following the series more  intensely all the time. The series reinvented itself last year and set  course for an exciting future. The collaboration with the teams is  very close and we would obviously have liked to have been there from  the outset. We are pleased to now be part of DTM and to take this path  together with our long-term partner BMW M Motorsport.” Marco Wittmann, #11 BMW M4 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport: “It is great to be a part of Walkenhorst  Motorsport again, and to compete in the DTM. As I have always raced in  the DTM since 2013, I am very much looking forward to the challenge.  Last year, we found our feet well as a new team, and in the new GT3  format. We enjoyed some real highs, claimed two victories with the BMW  M6 GT3, and were in contention for the title until shortly before the  end of the season. In the end, we finished fourth overall. We are now  looking to build on that success in 2022, especially in the knowledge  that we race with the new BMW M4 GT3 this year. I am looking forward  to appearing with the guys and girls at Walkenhorst Motorsport again,  and doing battle for victories and podiums. Perhaps we can have a big  say at the very top of the championship. I can hardly wait for the  tests and the first race at Portimão.” Esteban Muth, #10 BMW M4 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport: “I am extremely happy to join Walkenhorst  Motorsport this year. It will be great with them; I know the team  quite well from last year. They are very professional and they have  been in the championship game for quite a long time with Marco so it  is going to be nice; I am going to learn so much from him and the  team. I am going to work hard to get to the top and I think, with  Marco it’s for sure possible. He has always been nice to me so I think  he is going to help me a lot. I want to make it a strong season with  the BMW M4 GT3. I hope to get some podiums and try to be at the front  all the time. That would be the goal.” Philipp Eng, #25 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert  Motorsport: “After my three years in the Class One era, I am  looking forward to racing in the DTM again. I followed every  qualifying session and every race last year. I was always up to speed  and chatted regularly to my team-mates. The ITR did a super job with  such a large field in the first year after Class One, and I am certain  that we will again see a lot of good drivers and very strong teams on  the grid this year. The DTM quite simply has a crazy charisma about  it, and I am pleased to be back – especially with our new BMW M4 GT3.  I am particularly thrilled to be driving for Schubert Motorsport. We  have never worked together at races in the past, but I know the team  very well. I also have a super relationship with Sheldon van der  Linde, both on and off the track. In our two years as DTM team-mates,  we always chatted to and helped each other wherever possible. We have  a very sound basis, and I am looking forward to finally going racing.” Sheldon van der Linde, #31 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert  Motorsport: “I can’t wait to start my fourth year in DTM. I  have celebrated a lot of career highlights over the last three years  which I hope I can build on this year. I am really looking forward to  start working with Schubert Motorsport and my great friend and team  mate from the Class One days, Philipp Eng, who I greatly respect as a  driver and a person. I am pretty sure we will have a lot of fun  together and at the same time work closely with the team to help them  acclimatize to this new championship as quickly and efficiently as  possible. They are a super passionate group of guys and girls that  I’ve already had the honour of getting to know for one race in ADAC GT  Masters. That has perfectly set the tone for what’s to come with them  in DTM!”\n"}
{"prompt":"Exclusive THE 8 X JEFF KOONS limited-edition BMW model to be built at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing from March  Expressive design applied in unique combination of large-scale production processes and meticulous craftsmanship at Dingolfing paint shop  ->","completion":" Exclusive THE 8 X JEFF KOONS limited-edition BMW model to be    built at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing from March  Expressive design    applied in unique combination of large-scale production processes    and meticulous craftsmanship at Dingolfing paint shop  Dingolfing. On 17 February, the strictly  limited-edition model THE 8 X JEFF KOONS, based on the BMW M850i  xDrive Gran Coupé (fuel consumption combined: 11.0-10.7 l\/100 km WLTP,  CO2 emissions combined: 251-243 g\/km WLTP) celebrated its  world premiere on the occasion of the Frieze art fair in Los Angeles.  Production of the 99 models will get underway at BMW Group Plant  Dingolfing in March – relying on a unique combination of established  large-scale standard production processes and craftsmanship at the  Lower Bavarian plant’s paint shop.This exclusive special model is the most elaborately designed vehicle  in BMW history. Over a period of many months, American artist Jeff  Koons perfected sketches of the expressive exterior design of his  dream BMW and then assisted with its implementation in  three-dimensional form in the actual car.He travelled from New York to Dingolfing several times in the last  few months for workshops involving intense discussions with BMW  specialists about lines and joints, angles and perspectives, colours  or the choice and arrangement of materials for the vehicles’ interior.“We are proud to produce these ‘sculptures on wheels’ here in  Dingolfing and to share our extensive car building know-how, our  attention to detail, our precision and the craftsmanship of our  employees,” says Christoph Schröder, head of Plant Dingolfing. “It is  also a very special small series for us and an honour to work with one  of the most renowned artists of our time.”THE 8 X JEFF KOONSThe limited edition’s expressive, sporty and powerful exterior design  combines 11 different colours, from blue to silver and yellow to  black. It features pop-art elements as well as geometric patterns that  are precisely tailored to the sophisticated lines and forms of the BMW  8 Series Gran Coupé. The lines of colour that explode across the rear  of the vehicle are a direct tribute to Jeff Koons’ own 2010 BMW Art  Car. According to Koons, the “POP!” stencilled on the sides and the  swirls of wind symbolise power and speed.Over 200 hours of manual work for exterior paintwork aloneProduction of the vehicle will get underway at Plant Dingolfing in  March. The process for body construction and assembly does not differ  significantly from that of a BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé that can be  ordered as a regular product. However, other components and materials  chosen by the artist will also be installed in the limited-edition  model to customise the vehicle – from the seats in rich tones of red  and blue, to the finest leather, up to and including the artist’s  signature in the Bavarian Blue of the BMW logo on the cupholder trim.Once it reaches the paint shop, the limited-edition model goes  through an entirely custom process in which Jeff Koons’ unique design  is applied layer by layer to a vehicle with a Glacier Silver basecoat.  This does not, of course, take place in the normal series process on  the plant’s highly automated finish paint lines, but in separate spray  booths with workstations designed for skilled manual work. Here, a  team of around 20 employees applies the lettering, graphic elements  and coloured lines or surfaces by hand, layer by layer, with the help  of stencils or foils.“We use a total of eight different design colours,” explains Marco  Klante, the project manager at the Dingolfing paint shop. At certain  intervals, the vehicles are returned to the standard production  process, where the hand-applied design is “sealed” with a clear coat.  The vehicles are also finely brushed by hand on a regular basis to  ensure smooth transitions between individual painted design elements  that cannot be detected by hand. This is another highly time-consuming  process requiring the utmost precision. “Because all the paint coats  applied together are not even half a millimetre thick,” Klante explains.A hand-picked team of paint specialists was brought together for the  project, some of whom already had experience working on custom  paintwork for Rolls-Royce and the BMW 7 Series. The team, working in  three shifts around the clock, also includes former painting  apprentices who are among the best in the country. This means four of  these special models can be painted in a week. Each vehicle requires  well over 200 hours just for exterior painting of the body. Plastic  mounted parts like the elaborately painted tailgate are supplied by  the nearby BMW Group Plant Landshut.Those responsible at Plant Dingolfing are looking forward to the  official start of production. Christoph Schröder: “We are very well  prepared and have worked with Jeff Koons to optimise every detail for  overall effect. Now, we have to realise these 99 vehicles with maximum  precision and repeat accuracy as the artist intended and in the  interests of our customers.”CO2 EMISSIONS & FUEL CONSUMPTION.BMW M850i xDrive Gran CoupéFuel consumption combined: 11.0-10.7  l\/100 km WLTP,CO2 emissions combined: 251-243 g\/km WLTP. If you have any questions, please contact: Manuel Sattig, BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, head of CommunicationsTelephone: 49 8731 76 22020, Email: Manuel.Sattig@bmwgroup.com Thomas Niedermeier, BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, CommunicationsTelephone: +49 8731 76 27666, Email: Thomas.Niedermeier@bmwgroup.com Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.com, www.bmw-werk-dingolfing.deInstagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/bmwgroupwerkdingolfing\/Email: presse@bmw.de   BMW Group Plant Dingolfing Plant Dingolfing is  one of the BMW Group’s 31 global production sites and the company’s  largest European manufacturing facility.

In an exclusive edition of only  99 automobiles, a strictly limited number of the M850i xDrive Gran  Coupé were created by Jeff Koons and BMW during several years of close  collaboration. With THE 8 X JEFF KOONS, the most elaborately designed  vehicle in all of BMW's history will be presented to a global audience  for the first time on the occasion of Frieze Los Angeles. BMW is a  long-term partner of the art fair; Jeff Koons is represented globally,  and at Frieze Los Angeles, by Pace Gallery.Jeff Koons, artist: “My edition of the BMW 8 Series  is my dream car! It is very special to me and I’ve wanted to create a  special edition BMW for a long time. It is sporty and flashy as well  as minimalist and conceptual. I can’t wait to drive it and ride in it,  and I hope that people will enjoy the Gran Coupé just as much as I do.  On the car, the lines are getting bigger on their journey from the  hood towards the trunk, creating a sense of forward movement just as  the ‘POP!’ and the vapor thrust design elements do. The blue color  resembles the vastness of space and I like the idea of the car being a  global car. What matters is how we relate to each other and our  awareness of everything we are surrounded by. For the driver and all  passengers, there is a heightened state of pleasure. This is what my  car has to offer.”Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW  AG: “BMW thrives on constantly seeking out new challenges!  Working with Jeff Koons again has inspired us all – throughout  headquarters and across our plants in Germany. Never before in the  history of our company has a BMW been created with such an extensive  design effort as THE 8 X JEFF KOONS. A 'rolling sculpture' that will  not only be displayed as a coveted collector's item in museums but  will also be allowed to flourish on the road as a genuine BMW.”Over 200 hours of work time just for the exterior paint  jobThe expressive and striking design combines eleven  different exterior colors ranging from blue to silver as well as from  yellow to black. Only four cars will be painted each week. The  multi-colored interior is comprised of high-end materials, fine  leather and a cupholder lid with an edition badging and the artist’s  signature. The seats are made up of the striking red and blue which  reflects the colors of superheroes from the comic book universe as  well as those of the company’s high-performance unit BMW M. Overall,  the energetic and powerful design includes both elements of pop art as  well as geometric patterns paying homage to the sporty 8 Series Gran  Coupe’s intricate contours and shape. The exploding lines of color at  the rear, in turn, are their own unmediated homage to the artist's  2010 BMW Art Car, while the \"POP!\" on each side as well as  the vapor thrust imagery symbolize the power and speed of THE 8 X JEFF  KOONS, according to the artist.Over 200 hours of manual work were spent by highly specialized  professionals at the BMW Group plants in Dingolfing and Landshut on  the exterior paintwork alone, where the color samples were often  applied with magnifying glasses. \"Energetic,\"  \"tantalizing,\" and \"strong\" is how international  media described the car, following the publication of first design  studies on the occasion of the cooperation’s announcement in early  September 2021 at Munich's Pinakothek der Moderne museum. \"Dozens  of engineers and designers have given their all to celebrate our  partnership and make his vision come true,\" said Oliver Zipse.  The artist himself spent many days on site at the Dingolfing plant  over a period of numerous months discussing design options with the  BMW employees involved. “I was thinking very intensely about it: What  is the essence of the 8 Series Gran Coupé? What is the essence of  power? How to create something that exemplifies all the energy of the  BMW 8 Series that is also able to touch upon the human element?”Koons signature in the Bavarian blue of the BMW  logoEach vehicle comes with a large-format certificate  signed by Jeff Koons, which in addition to Oliver Zipse's signature  also contains the individual Vehicle Identification Number of the  respective vehicle. The artist also designed the dust jacket of the  Driver's Manual. One further signature of the artist is let into the  cupholder panel. Koons deliberately chose the Bavarian blue from the  BMW logo.The original BMW 850i was the first model of the 8 Series launched in  1990 and was celebrated as creating a new perspective of progress in  advanced motoring, appealing to the connoisseur who acknowledges  elegance and performance as the ultimate blend of perfection. THE 8 X  JEFF KOONS also continues this tradition.New York: Christie's auction for a good causeIn  2010, the American artist already created a unique BMW M3 GT2 Art Car  which performed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and was unveiled at  the Centre Pompidou in Paris. That same year, the rock singer Bono  from U2 wrote in an editorial for the New York Times that Jeff Koons  should have a part in designing the car of the future. BMW and Koons  continued the conversation and in early 2020 decided on a limited  edition of the new BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé, which had its world  premiere in January 2022.Initially, THE 8 X JEFF KOONS will be on display for the general  public in Manhattan's Rockefeller Plaza before one vehicle from the  edition, signed on the tailgate by Jeff Koons,  will be auctioned off  at Christie's in New York on April 4. All proceeds from the highest  bid will go to the International Centre for Missing & Exploited  Children (ICMEC). Jeff Koons has been personally involved with this  nonprofit NGO for over two decades.Following its world premiere, THE 8 X JEFF KOONS will be presented at  numerous art fairs and events in Europe, Asia and the Middle East,  including the 16th Istanbul Contemporary, Paris Photo, the Goodwood  Festival of Speed, Art Dubai, West Bund Art & Design Fair Shanghai  and Art Basel Hong Kong.History of the BMW Art CarsInitiated by French  race car driver and art aficionado Hervé Poulain and conceived in  collaboration with the founder of BMW Motorsport Jochen Neerpasch, the  first BMW Art Car was commissioned when both asked Alexander Calder to  design Poulain’s BMW race car in 1975. Since then, 19 artists from  throughout the world have created BMW automobiles of their time. The  BMW Art Cars by Roy Lichtenstein, Esther Mahlangu, Jenny Holzer, Andy  Warhol, David Hockney, Ólafur Elíasson, Frank Stella, Robert  Rauschenberg, Cao Fei and John Baldessari, among others, are all  inspired by developments in art, design and technology. Jeff Koons  designed the 17th BMW Art Car in 2010, the BMW M3 GT2, which also  competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. On the occasion of 50 years of  BMW Group Cultural Engagement last year, the Art Cars entered the  digital realm and are presented in augmented reality since then. Via  the free Acute Art app, the digital rolling sculptures are accessible  to everyone around the world at any time. BMW M850i xDrive Gran Coupé:Combined fuel consumption: 11.0 –  10.7 l\/100 km according to WLTP,combined CO2 emissions: 251 –  243 g\/km according to WLTP.THE 8 X JEFF KOONS: Price upon request.

{"prompt":" Plastic exterior components for strictly limited edition of BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé crafted at BMW Group Plant Landshut – Car designed by American artist Jeff Koons  Biggest challenge for Landshut custom paint shop: “Capturing the spirit of the artist and implementing the details in a technical small-series process” ->","completion":" Plastic exterior components for strictly limited edition    of BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé crafted at BMW Group Plant Landshut – Car    designed by American artist Jeff Koons Biggest challenge for Landshut custom paint shop:    “Capturing the spirit of the artist and implementing the details in    a technical small-series process” München \/ Landshut. Painting expertise from BMW Group  Plant Landshut is currently being showcased in a strictly limited  edition of the M850i xDrive Gran Coupé (fuel consumption combined:  11.0-10.7 l\/100 km WLTP, CO2 emissions combined: 251-243 g\/km WLTP)  created by American artist Jeff Koons for a small production run of  just 99 vehicles – the most elaborately designed vehicle in BMW history.Around 2,000 painted plastic outer panel sections in 45 standard and  200 custom colours leave the Landshut plant every workday. This adds  up to about half a million components a year, including bumpers,  side-sills, spoilers and trim – not counting small-series and custom paintwork.The Landshut paint specialists are now putting their years of  expertise to work in a very special vehicle, a limited edition of the  BMW 8 Series Gran Coupé – THE 8 X JEFF KOONS. The car was designed by  American artist Jeff Koons and features pop-art elements, as well as  geometric patterns.The special edition vehicles will be built at BMW Group Plant  Dingolfing, while BMW Group Plant Landshut will supply all painted  plastic outer panel sections, including the bumpers, side-sills,  mirror caps, door handles and the tailgate. All components are crafted  to the highest degree of precision.“The biggest challenge was to understand and capture the spirit of  the artist right from the start and to implement his very precise  demands in detail by hand in a technical small-series process,”  explains Hermann Knott, head of Production Paint and Finish. “This is  also a very special project for us – because these cars are really  sculptures on wheels.”One of the most technically complex components for the vehicle is the  stylish tailgate, requiring seven different colours and twelve coats  of paint with a total thickness of less than 250 μ. For comparison, a  human hair has a diameter of about 100 μ. “Applying multi-coloured  paintwork is particularly challenging as far as haptics and optics are  concerned,” explains Knott. The so-called “multitone” process used for  this was specially developed at the Landshut custom paint shop. “We  had various meetings with Jeff Koons’ team, where we discussed  everything needed for the process in detail,” reports Knott.A key element was how to realise the artist’s one-dimensional design  in three-dimensional, geometric vehicle components. A computer  programme connected to a laser projector was used to ensure the  accuracy of every detail. The laser then projected the design in  linear form onto the respective component. The contours between  individual layers of paint were meticulously hand stencilled, a task  requiring years of experience and craftsmanship.Most of the roughly 100 employees involved in the project received  special additional training to be able to meet the artistic  requirements. “Crafting the Jeff Koons components is different to both  our standard finishing by robots and our established custom painting  processes. It requires considerable individual experience and flair,  because there are many influencing factors,” explains Knott.“Taking pleasure in innovation and craftsmanship are two outstanding  characteristics of our staff at the Landshut location. That is why we  are especially proud that our Exterior Plastic team is once again  setting the benchmark for custom paintwork,” says Dr Stefan  Kasperowski, head of BMW Group Plant Landshut. THE 8 X JEFF KOONSTHE 8 X JEFF KOONS is the embodiment of precision, sophistication and  craftsmanship. It took 285 hours to apply its multiple coats of paint,  for instance, since its impressively expressive design combines 11  different colours, from blue to silver and yellow to black. This means  only two car bodies can be painted per week. The multi-coloured  interior is characterised by its impressive use of high-quality  materials and the finest leather, in addition to featuring the  artist’s signature. The seats are in rich hues of red and blue, the  colours of superheroes from the comic universe and the  high-performance brand BMW M. The sporty, powerful design features  both pop-art elements and geometric patterns – a nod to the  sophisticated lines and forms of the 8 Series Gran Coupé. The lines of  colour that explode across the rear of the vehicle are a direct  tribute to the artist's own 2010 BMW Art Car. According to Koons, the  “POP!” stencilled on the sides and the swirls of wind symbolise the  power and speed of THE 8 X JEFF KOONS. The BMW 850i was the first BMW  8 Series model to be introduced back in 1990. Acclaimed for its  visionary approach to the future of driving, it appealed to car lovers  who appreciate its perfect union of elegance and performance. Highly  skilled specialists at BMW Plants Dingolfing and Landshut spent almost  300 hours working by hand on the exterior paintwork of THE 8 X JEFF  KOONS alone, often using a magnifying glass to apply its colourful patterns. CO2 EMISSIONS & FUEL CONSUMPTION.BMW M850i xDrive Gran CoupéFuel consumption combined: 11.0-10.7 l\/100 km WLTP,CO2 emissions combined: 251-243 g\/km WLTP. If you have any questions, please  contact:Saskia EßbauerBMW Group Corporate and  Governmental Affairs Communications Landshut Telephone: +49 871  702 3232Cell phone: +49 151 6040 3232Email: Saskia.Essbauer@bmw.de   Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.com   Email: presse@bmw.de   BMW Group Plant LandshutAt BMW Group Plant  Landshut, around 3,500 employees produce light metal cast engine,  suspension and body structure components, plastic components for the  vehicle exterior, carbon body components, cockpit and equipment  options, electric drive systems, special engines and drive shafts.

The BMW Junior Team enters its third year in 2022, and    will be in action on two fronts with the BMW M4 GT3. Dan Harper    (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) will team up with BMW    M Team RMG at the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), as they look to    challenge for overall victory at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. More    highlights await the trio in the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance    Cup. There, the BMW Junior Team and ROWE Racing will contest five    endurance races, with the highlight being the 24 Hours of    Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). At the wheel of the second ROWE Racing BMW    M4 GT3 will be BMW M works drivers Nick Catsburg (NED), Augusto    Farfus (BRA) and Nick Yelloly (GBR).  “The term BMW Junior Team has become a legendary one, even outside of  BMW M Motorsport. I am very pleased that we have been able to add new  chapters to this legend since 2020,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of  BMW M GmbH and one of the mentors of the current BMW Junior Team. “Dan  Harper, Max Hesse and Neil Verhagen have performed impressively for  the past two years and lived up to name ‘BMW Junior Team’. I am  certain that they will cause quite a stir again this season at the  wheel of the BMW M4 GT3. I find it particularly fascinating how the  current success sees the project come full circle since the founding  of the first BMW Junior Team in 1977, thanks to Jochen Neerpasch’s  initiative. Even after so many decades, Mr Neerpasch remains a great  asset and inspiration for BMW M Motorsport.” Neerpasch says: “The BMW Junior Team has successfully completed its  apprenticeship on the Nordschleife for the past two years. The three  lads are now preparing intensively for their biggest test at the  Nürburgring 24 Hours. We have high expectations of them. As far as the  drivers themselves are concerned, I see the BMW Junior Team on the  podium. They will also be put to the test in the GT World Challenge  Europe. They will be driving at racetracks that are new to them, and  will be up against the best GT drivers in the world – at ROWE Racing,  they will be in direct comparison with established BMW M works  drivers. It is going to be an eventful season, but I am sure that they  will succeed again in the new environment.” Harper, Hesse and Verhagen are currently with Formula Medicine in  Viareggio (ITA), where they are preparing physically and mentally for  the season ahead. They are living together in one house there, as they  will do at the Nürburgring again after the GT World Challenge Europe  test at the start of March. This is to ensure they are as close as  possible to the racetrack and BMW M Team RMG ahead of the start of the  season. The first race in the BMW M4 GT3 will be the opening round of  the Nürburgring Endurance Series on 26th March – followed  by the first race in the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup at  Imola (ITA) on 3rd April. The focus will then switch fully  to the Nordschleife until the 24-hour race on  28th\/29th May. The GT World Challenge season  continues at the start of June at Le Castellet (FRA). This is followed  by the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps and the final two races at  Hockenheim (GER) and Barcelona (ESP). Base camp for the BMW Junior  Team for the second half of the season will be Viareggio. The team responsible for the BMW M4 GT3 that the BMW Junior Team will  drive in the GT World Challenge Europe is ROWE Racing. Team principal  Hans-Peter Naundorf’s outfit will compete with a second BMW M4 GT3,  driven by BMW M works drivers Nick Catsburg, Augusto Farfus and Nick  Yelloly. ROWE Racing will also start with two BMW M4 GT3 and a strong  contingent of BMW M works drivers at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. The  detailed driver line-up will be announced shortly. More quotes. Hans-Peter Naundorf, team principal ROWE Racing: “We  are very happy to go into the 2022 season of the GT World Challenge  Europe with such a strong squad of drivers. It is going to be an  exciting year, with three very experienced BMW M works drivers in one  car and the three guys from the BMW Junior Team in the other. That is  a perfect mix. We are very proud that BMW M Motorsport has entrusted  us with accompanying the next step of the BMW Junior Team this year.  We followed their positive development last year. They improved  consistently and hardly made a mistake at the toughest racetrack in  the world. As such, the logical next step in their career is to move  up into an international racing series. Nick Catsburg and Nick Yelloly  have been among the guarantees of success for our team for a long  time, and have emphatically demonstrated their class many times.  Personally, I am thrilled to be working with Augusto Farfus for the  first time in our seventh year with BMW. His success and history with  BMW speak volumes and I find it particularly interesting how he still  goes about his work with so much joy and enthusiasm.” Stefan Reinhold, team principal BMW M Team RMG:  “After last year’s intensive test work, my whole team is now looking  forward to going up against the strong opposition at the Nürburgring  with the BMW M4 GT3. We know the car well and are confident that we  will quickly become competitive on the Nordschleife. Despite that, it  is obviously still a new car, so the preparatory races are extremely  important for us, in order to prepare as well as possible for the big  highlight – the 24-hour race. The expectations for our home race are  very high. The collaboration with the BMW Junior Team is working  excellently. In our second year together, we are a well-coordinated  team, and the guys have huge potential as drivers. If we can work  together to convert that into performance at the circuit, we can  compete at the very front. Victory at our home race is still missing  from the BMW M Team RMG collection.” Dan Harper: “The programme looks great! It is  fantastic to return to the Nordschleife with BMW M Team RMG, and this  time to do battle for overall victory in the 24-hour race. In the GT  World Challenge Europe, I will get to know five circuits that are  totally new to me. I am really looking forward to that. The 24 Hours  of Spa-Francorchamps will obviously be a highlight, and it is great to  be working with such an experienced and winning team there as ROWE  Racing. Lining up against three experienced BMW M works drivers in the  same team will be a very special challenge.” Max Hesse: “Our third year as the BMW Junior Team is  going to be exciting, as a new car and a new race schedule await us.  We have already gained some initial experience of the BMW M4 GT3 and  are currently in Viareggio preparing for the start of the season. We  already know BMW M Team RMG well and I am sure we will work well  together on the Nordschleife again. I am really looking forward to  working with our new partner team ROWE Racing and, of course, to the  races in a fantastic series like the GT World Challenge Europe. We  really wanted to race in this series. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport  for the faith they are putting in us!” Neil Verhagen: “We have been preparing intensively,  both physically and mentally, for weeks now, in order to be top fit  come the start of the season. We can now hardly wait to get back out  on track for the first tests. Our big goal for the Nordschleife is to  challenge for overall victory in the 24-hour race. The GT World  Challenge Europe with ROWE Racing is going to be a fantastic new  experience for us. We are learning new racetracks and will go wheel to  wheel with the best GT drivers in the world. I am sure we will learn  an awful lot there.”\n"}
{"prompt":"The edition model of the fully electric MINI combines authentic style with sustainable driving pleasure.  ->","completion":" Munich. With its combination of tradition-steeped  design features and forward-looking drive technology, the MINI Cooper  SE (combined power consumption: 17.6 – 15.2 kWh\/100 km according to  WLTP; combined CO2 emissions: 0 g\/km) in the Resolute  Edition is a striking embodiment of individual style. The edition  model of the purely electrically powered model based on the MINI 3  door offers a particularly appealing blend of classic sporty flair and  sustainability. Its exclusive exterior design makes for an authentic  appearance inspired by the brand’s history. In this way, the MINI  Cooper SE in the Resolute Edition clearly conveys the message that  locally emission-free driving fun has now become an integral part of  the brand’s character and its more than 60-year history.With its 135 kW\/184 hp electric motor and thrillingly agile handling,  the MINI Cooper SE transfers the brand’s hallmark go-kart feeling to  the world of electric mobility. Its range of up to 234 kilometres –  determined according to the WLTP test cycle – enables locally  emission-free driving fun both in an urban setting and on outings well  beyond the city limits. These are the qualities that have made the  fully electric MINI the brand’s most popular model variant, with  global sales figures having almost doubled in 2021. The exclusive  design and equipment features of the Resolute Edition now give  sustainable driving fun even greater appeal.With a body finish in Rebel Green – previously reserved for the  extremely athletic John Cooper Works models – and the contrasting  Pepper White finish for the roof and exterior mirror caps, the MINI  Cooper SE in the Resolute Edition has a sporty look in  tradition-steeped British style. The deliberate avoidance of chrome  elements on the exterior provides a look ahead to the future: instead,  the hallmark design features are finished in exclusive Resolute  Bronze. These include the surrounds of the headlights, radiator grille  and rear lights, the side scuttles on the front side panels and the  handles of the doors and tailgate. By contrast, the surrounding strip  at the lower edge of the windscreen is finished in Piano Black, as are  the inner frame of the radiator grille, the brand logos and the model inscription.The unmistakable appearance of the MINI Cooper SE in the Resolute  Edition is further enhanced by means of bonnet stripes in an exclusive  design. Like the door sill trims, they feature a pattern made up of  parallel lines with a colour gradient that runs between a light and a  dark shade of gold, along with the inscription “RESOLUTE”. The edition  model features 17-inch alloy wheels in Electric Collection Spoke  design. Alternatively, light alloy wheels of the same format are  available in the variant Tentacle Spoke Black.In the interior of the MINI Cooper SE in the Resolute Edition, the  sense of hallmark driving fun is further reinforced by means of seats  in the fabric\/leatherette finish Black Pearl\/Light Chequered and an  anthracite-coloured roof liner, as well as black armrests and knee  rolls. The sports leather steering wheel in Nappa finish bears an  edition-specific MINI Resolute logo on the lower spoke. With evenly  curved lines in a light golden tone, the graphic design forms an  exquisite pinstripe pattern on the interior surfaces.The Resolute Edition’s exclusive design features go together to form  a perfectly harmonised overall package for premium exterior and  interior style. The edition model of the MINI Cooper SE will be  available from March 2022. While the car’s look clearly conveys a  sense of tradition, this can be combined with state-of-the-art  equipment features in the areas of driver assistance, infotainment and  connectivity. The optional driver assistance package includes a lane  departure warning function which alerts the driver to the risk of  leaving the lane unintentionally by causing the steering wheel to  vibrate.

BMW Manufacturing led the  nation in automotive exports by value for the eighth consecutive year,  according to data released by the U.S. Department of Commerce. During  2021, BMW Plant Spartanburg exported 257,876 BMWs with a total export  value of more than $10.1 billion. The BMWs produced in Spartanburg,  South Carolina, were exported to about 120 countries primarily through  the Port of Charleston, SC (nearly 219,000 units), through five  additional southeastern ports and by rail to Canada.The top five export countries from BMW Manufacturing were China  (24.1% of export volume), Germany (12.3%), South Korea (9.4%), Canada  (5.6%), and Great Britain (5.4%).“Free trade and open markets are essential for global businesses and  economies to grow. It is the reason BMW and South Carolina have been  successful,” said Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management  of BMW AG responsible for Production. “Plant Spartanburg contributes  greatly to the success of the BMW Group.

{"prompt":"From today, the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink is on display in the new BMW i exhibition at BMW Welt. ->","completion":" At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the BMW  Group presented the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink – a unique technology  that enables the exterior to change colour. From now until the  mid-March, visitors to the BMW Welt have the opportunity to view the  spectacular vehicle in the recently opened BMW i exhibition.What is the technology behind the color change and what is the    added value?The special paint finish works in a similar way to the technology in  e-book readers. A special body foiling integrates several million  colour capsules. Negatively charged white or positively charged black  pigments are stimulated by electrical signals and collect on the  surface and in this way change the exterior colour. \"In this way,  we give drivers the freedom to express different sides of their  personality to the outside world and redefine them on every  journey,\" says Stella Clarke, Project Head of BMW iX Flow  featuring E Ink. With the ability to change the exterior colour and to  display different patterns, the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink opens up  new worlds for an individual driving experience. But the technology  also offers numerous potential areas of application beyond the  customer experience, for example to improve energy efficiency. The  electrophoretic paint in the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink differs from  displays in that it does not constantly consume energy. Only when  switching over is electricity very briefly required. The matching  exterior colour actually improves the energy efficiency of the  vehicle. A white surface will reflect sunlight significantly more than  a black one, meaning the interior heats up less. Changing the colour  thus reduces energy consumption. The colour change in the all-electric  BMW iX not only boosts the mood of the passengers, but also the  vehicle's range.BMW Welt Opening Hours.Monday to Saturday from  7.30 a.m. until 00.00 midnight.

For its role as the MotoGP™ Safety Car, the BMW M2 CS  Racing only required modifications in a few areas, including the  addition of light bars and front lights. The livery of the new BMW M2  CS Racing MotoGP™ Safety Cars is a reference to the 50th anniversary  and based on the anniversary logo of BMW M GmbH. Completing the BMW M fleet for the 2022 MotoGP™ season are the BMW M3  Competition Safety Car, the BMW M4 Competition Safety Car, the BMW M5  CS Safety Car, the BMW M8 Competition Gran Coupé Safety Car, the BMW  X5 M Competition Medical Car, and two BMW M 1000 RR Safety Bikes.

(BBA)  joint venture until 2040 takes effect. The agreement on the contract extension was signed by the two joint  venture partners back in October 2018, on BBA’s 15th anniversary. The  corresponding amendment to the contract comes into force with the new  “business licence”, which BBA received today from the relevant Chinese authorities. “Today marks an important step, as we continue to expand our long and  successful commitment to China. We firmly believe that our continued  success in the world’s largest automotive market can only go hand in  hand with the growth and further development of our BBA joint venture.  The joint venture contract has been extended until 2040 and lays the  foundation for sustainable business success, creating growth and  prosperity in the province of Liaoning and beyond,” said Oliver Zipse,  Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. With the issuance of the new “business licence”, also the increase of  BMW Group’s stake in BBA becomes effective on 11 February 2022, as  agreed upon by both joint venture partners in 2018. BMW Group now  holds 75% of the shares in BBA, while its Chinese partner, Brilliance  China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (CBA), indirectly holds the remaining 25%. Last year, a total of 846,237 BMW Group vehicles were delivered to  customers in the Chinese market (+8.9% against 2020). In 2021, BBA  produced more than 700,000 BMW vehicles, with around 23,000 employees. In response to strong demand, BBA is increasing production capacity  in Shenyang again this year: The BBA plant in the Dadong district is  currently undergoing a comprehensive expansion, while a completely new  plant is also being built in the Tiexi district. The BMW Group will  use the additional capacity to locally manufacture models for the  Chinese market, which are also being produced in other plants. It will  also be used to manufacture additional fully electric models in China. “BBA’s remarkable success story testifies to the proven partnership  within the joint venture and with the provincial government in  Liaoning,” said Nicolas Peter, member of the Board of Management of  BMW AG responsible for Finance. “Our local investments are proving to  be the right approach. BBA has significantly contributed to position  the BMW brand as a leading premium brand in China. In the past decade  alone, BBA has invested more than 10 billion euros in China. Our  extended joint venture contract lays the foundation for further mutual  growth and progressive development in the future. It therefore paves  the way for balanced development in the three main regions of the  world, as we have done in the past.” Founded in 2003 with Chinese partner Brilliance China Automotive  Holdings Ltd. (CBA), the joint venture produces BMW vehicles with  internal combustion engines and electric drivetrains for the Chinese  market and for export at two locations in Shenyang (Liaoning Province). Effective 11 February, the BBA joint venture will be fully  consolidated in the Group Financial Statements of BMW AG.

The new MINI Edition models are due to hit  the showrooms in spring 2022. For the first time, all current models  of the tradition-steeped British premium car manufacturer will be  launched at the same time, each in its own special edition. The market  launch will be accompanied by an equally novel form of communication.  An international campaign under the claim BIG LOVE presents the MINI 3  door with the all-electric variant MINI Cooper SE (combined power  consumption: 17.6 – 15.2 kWh\/100 km according to WLTP; combined  CO2 emissions: 0 g\/km) as a highlight, along with the MINI  5 door and the MINI Convertible in the Resolute Edition, the MINI  Clubman in the Untold Edition and the MINI Countryman in the Untamed  Edition – each as an individual vehicle character in a virtual world  of its own. Each is showcased in surprising and impressive style in a  100 per cent digital format using the very latest full CGI (Computer  Generated Imagery) animation technology.The campaign adopts an integrated approach that makes use of all MINI  brand communication channels along the customer journey. The numerous  visual content formats targeted at the sales funnel creates a  completely new look: using everything from AR animations, stories and  reels through to various types of online ad, MINI gears its content  precisely towards a digital-savvy audience. The innovative approach  adopted by the BIG LOVE launch campaign enables MINI to address target  groups in the markets even more selectively, closely aligning it with  local priorities.“The campaign for the new MINI Editions is our first major global  project to be produced by The Marcom Engine, BMW Group’s new European  agency platform. It’s the first full CGI production to reflect fun,  style and the theme of BIG LOVE by featuring the personalities of  these unique vehicles,” says Sebastian Beuchel, Head of MINI Global  Brand Management. “Working with Anomaly London on the creative concept  and with The Marcom Engine including Man vs Machine with their CGI  expertise in production and delivery, we were seeking to create a  truly bold, digitally-focused communication that would resonate with  all our various audiences, no matter what stage of the buying process  they are at.”The central building blocks of the campaign are computer-generated  images and virtual animated films. Using 3D computer graphics, images  and films are created showing detailed vehicles in a setting that  transcends the boundaries of reality.The MINI Edition models always play the leading role in the animated  short films. Each model is showcased and brought to life in its own  lively animated world. The protagonists of the films are presented  with their exclusive design and equipment features, demonstrating  hallmark MINI go-kart feeling with state-of-the-art visual effects –  without the cars ever touching a real road.“Our campaign creates a virtual world for the new MINI Editions  beyond the realm of day-to-day reality in which their unique character  is the clear focus. It is fully animated and designed in the  unmistakable MINI style,” says Anita Skocic, Head of Global Marketing  Campaigns. “We use highly advanced CGI technology to push the  boundaries of conventional forms of representation so as to convey to  the audience that unique MINI feeling.”The campaign also includes the launch of an online showroom by MINI  where fans of the brand can interactively find out about the new  Edition models with pictures, videos and 360-degree views. The new  vehicles can be viewed on a digital turntable from all conceivable  perspectives, both as an overall image in wide angle and via close-ups  that clearly show all the details. The showroom for the new MINI  Edition models will go online at www.MINI.com as well as on the various  country websites. The campaign is also available for use by all MINI  dealers and branches.In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Spokesperson Product Communications  MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com\n"}

{"prompt":"Conceived by Goodby Silverstein & Partners and directed by Bryan Buckley, the 60-second spot will air during the third commercial break of the first quarter. BMW to launch two All-New, fully electric vehicles in the U.S. next month – the BMW iX Sports Activity Vehicle and the four-door BMW i4 Gran Coupe.  ->","completion":" Woodcliff Lake, NJ. BMW will debut a new 60-second  advertisement during the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 13, 2022, to  showcase its All-New, fully electric BMW iX Sports Activity Vehicle,  which arrives in the US next month. The star-studded spot features  legendary actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Academy Award nominee Salma  Hayek Pinault, and was directed by two-time Academy Award nominated  director Bryan Buckley. It will air during the third commercial break  of the first quarter of the game.Schwarzenegger stars as Zeus, the Greek god of lightning, and Hayek  Pinault plays his wife, the goddess Hera, as they retire from Mt.  Olympus to a quiet life in Palm Springs, California.  However, the  monotony of retirement quickly weighs on Zeus, who becomes frustrated  by his struggles with earthly electronics and his nagging mortal  neighbors’ constant requests to charge their electric golf carts and  hedge trimmers. Meanwhile, Hera, the hero of the story, has fully  acclimated and is thriving in retirement. In an effort to bring some  excitement back into Zeus’s life, she gifts him with an all-electric  BMW iX, which quickly helps reignite her husband’s electric mojo. The  spot closes with the happy couple rocking down the road in their new  BMW iX to Eddy Grant’s “Electric Avenue” while Zeus uses his electric  power to change the traffic lights to green.“All-electric mobility is at the very heart of the BMW brand,” said  Jens Thiemer, senior vice president, customer and brand, BMW AG.  “There is no better place to make this statement than in front of one  of the largest television audiences in the world, where viewers tune  in as much for the commercials as they do for the game. With Arnold  and Salma, we are able show the world the new BMW iX in a memorable  and impactful way.”“The humor lies in this legendary god of lightning, who is supposed  to be indestructible, battling with everyday electronics,” said  Schwarzenegger. “It is only when his brilliant wife presents him with  the gift of an all-electric BMW iX that Zeus is struck with the mighty  power of electricity and is completely rejuvenated.”The spot was conceived by BMW’s lead U.S. creative agency, Goodby  Silverstein & Partners, and directed by two-time Academy Award  nominated director Bryan Buckley, highly acclaimed for his work on  more than 65 Super Bowl commercials. The ad also marks Hayek Pinault’s  debut in a Super Bowl spot and the first time she and Schwarzenegger  have costarred in a national ad.“This is my first Super Bowl commercial—and the first time I’ve  played a Greek goddess,” said Hayek Pinault. “Seventy-five percent of  the decisions made in a marriage about where to spend the money are  made by women, and in this commercial, it is the woman who decides on  the right car to get her husband back on track. Of course, the  commercial is entertaining, but there is also a real human truth to it.”“I’ve done 60-some-odd Super Bowl spots. I’ve never had more star  power than these two,” said director Bryan Buckley. “When I first saw   Schwarzenegger’s name on the script, I was in. And Salma—there is no  one greater as an actress. It’s a movie in 60 seconds, and it’s on the  biggest platform.”“Transcending sports, this iconic annual event isn’t just a  championship game. It’s a cultural phenomenon where viewers pay even  more attention when the action on the field stops,” said Rich  Silverstein, co-founder and co-chairman of Goodby Silverstein &  Partners. “There’s only one person on the planet who could say he’s  Zeus, and that’s Arnold. And there’s only one brand worthy of being  called the Ultimate Electric Driving Machine, and that’s BMW. We  needed to showcase this in a big way, and that is what we’re doing on  February 13.”Designed to provide more than just mortal mobility, the BMW iX brings  together the fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology with the  company’s latest developments in the fields of design, connectivity,  digital services and sustainability. With 516 hp and a 0–60 time of  only 4.6 seconds, the BMW iX offers an exhilarating driving experience  with an EPA estimate of up to 324 miles of all-electric range and the  latest in-vehicle technology, including 5G connectivity, a sweeping  curved display that unites the 12.3-inch information display with a  14.9-inch central control display, and the debut of BMW iDrive 8, the  company’s latest user-interface system. The BMW iX starts at $83,200  plus $995 destination and handling.“This is a pinnacle event in the U.S. and the perfect stage on which  to introduce the BMW iX to our customers,” said Uwe Dreher, vice  president, marketing, BMW of North America. “We have already seen a  significant number of preorders for both the BMW iX and BMW i4, and a  huge amount of excitement for these two new electric vehicles.”Alongside the BMW iX, BMW will also launch the fully electric BMW i4  four-door Gran Coupe in the U.S. next month as the company takes a  major step toward its stated goal of reaching global sales of 50%  electric vehicles by 2030.BMW’s last Super Bowl had appeared in 2015 and featured Katie Couric  and Bryant Gumbel as they marveled over BMW’s first fully electric  production vehicle, the BMW i3. The BMW i3 was a pioneer of  electromobility and later became one of the best-selling premium  electric vehicles in the world.

Tickets will be available as of March 8,  2022, at München Ticket.This year‘s events will again be hosted by Hannah Weiss, winner of  the BMW Welt Young Artist Jazz Award 2019. Raised in Basel and Zurich,  she was surrounded by music of all genres from a very young age. Since  her graduation in jazz singing at Munich’s Academy of Music in 2018,  Hannah Weiss’ career has steadily been gaining momentum with  performances in various ensembles and concert projects.JuryThe jury, headed by Oliver  Hochkeppel (journalist for music and cultural affairs,  Süddeutsche Zeitung), consists of Heike Lies  (Musicologist, Music and Music Theatre Division of the Department of  Cultural Affairs of the state capital Munich ), Christiane  Böhnke-Geisse (Director of schwere reiter Musik),    Roland Spiegel (Editor and jazz expert at German  broadcasting station Bayerischer Rundfunk BR‑KLASSIK) and    Andreas Kolb (Editor-in-chief of JazzZeitung.de and  nmz – neue musikzeitung).  Artists and ensemblesMarch 8, 2022: Julia Hülsmann TrioBerlin-based  pianist Julia Hülsmann is one of the select German musicians “who give  fresh impetus to the world of European jazz”, said the jury of SWR  Jazz Award as early as 2016. Hülsmann first made her mark with lyrical  interpretations for the label ACT in collaboration with prominent  vocalists such as Rebekka Bakken, Anna Lauvergnac and Roger Cicero.  Since moving to ECM in 2008, she has to date released seven albums,  all featuring her inimitable, delicate and completely pared-down  performances on the piano interpreting her own compositions. At the  heart of each project is her trio with bassist Marc Muellbauer and  drummer Heinrich Köbberling, which has performed in this constellation  for 20 years. This year, the current awardee of the German Jazz Prize  and her trio will be on stage at the BMW Welt Jazz Award.March 22, 2022: Jacob Karlzon TrioSwedish  musician Jacob Karlzon counts among the outstanding jazz pianists  coming out of Scandinavia in recent years. Following a long period as  accompanist of vocalist Viktoria Tolstoy, Karlzon made his name on the  international stage with numerous projects of his own. Combining his  passion for improvisation with unexpected, rock rhythms and an open  style characteristic to Scandinavian jazz, he prefers the term  “alternative artist” to jazz pianist. True to his own style, Karlzon’s  albums to date show influences from Ravel to hard bop, from metal to  EDM, merged effortlessly by his preference for minimalist melodies. He  is currently in Munich, promoting his new album “Wanderlust”, released  by Warner and featuring the trio’s other members, bassist Morten  Ramsbøl and drummer Rasmus Kihlberg.April 5, 2022: Anat Fort TrioPianist Anat Fort  ranks among the Israeli artists raised in New York that continue to  put their mark on contemporary jazz. Fort has since returned to  Israel, a move that in no way slowed down her international career.  Since 2007, she has been publishing her albums at the Munich-based  label ECM with her most recent album “Birdwatching” featuring Italian  clarinetist Gianluigi Trovesi as star guest. As so many of her great  jazz pianist colleagues, Fort prefers performing as part of a trio  working together with bassist Gary Wand and drummer Roland Schneider.  Various experiments including her most recent collaboration with tango  guitarist and vocalist Shlomo Ydov notwithstanding, the trio has been  her ensemble of choice for over 20 years and a constant throughout her  artistic career. The resulting trust allows for unparalleled freedom  of improvisation, as seen on their most recent album “Colour”,  released by Sunnyside Records, and soon to be heard at BMW Welt.April 12, 2022: Giovanni Guidi QuintetWhile  still a teenager, pianist Giovanni Guidi truly impressed trumpeter  Enrico Rava, Italian super star of jazz, during Rava’s jazz workshops  and has been his permanent accompanist ever since. In that capacity as  well as increasingly with his own projects and ensembles, Guidi has  since been making his name on the international stage. For his current  programme “Avec le temps” he and his fellow trio members, Chicago-born  bassist Joe Rehmer and Portuguese drummer João Lobo, were joined by  two other prominent names of the Italian jazz world: woodwind player  Francesco Bearzatti and guitarist Roberto Cecchetto. The ensemble  prefers impressionist, lyrical and bluesy sounds, as seen in their  homages to poet, composer and chansonnier Léo Ferré or the recently  deceased trumpeter Tomasz Stańko.April 19, 2022: Marco Mezquida TrioPianist  Marco Mezquida is one of the most versatile and most productive  representatives of the Spanish jazz world. Known from a very young age  as a “prodigy”, “workaholic at the piano” and “once-in-a-century  musician” in his native country, this Menorca-born artist has, at the  tender age of 34, recorded over 30 albums to date. He performs solo  improvisation and delivers programmes with duos, trios or orchestras.  With his inspiration coming from sources as far-ranging as Ravel,  Skrjabin, Bach and traditional American jazz, Mezquida’s work is best  described as a pioneering, modern interpretation of Spanish folklore.  This can also be seen in his work with Flamenco guitarist Chicuelo, a  project that was very successful both in Germany and on the  international stage, or his most recent work “Talismán”, which he  recorded with cellist Martín Meléndez and drummer and percussionist  Aleix Tobias.April 26, 2022: Ashley Henry QuartetThe last of  the evening concerts of this year’s BMW Welt Jazz Award will feature  its youngest participant. 30-year-old London-based pianist Ashley  Henry completed his studies at the Royal Academy of Music as recently  as 2016. Widely known as a prodigy, Henry was offered the opportunity  to perform alongside legends such as Terence Blanchard and Jean  Toussaint that very same year and was invited as the youngest  participant to date to play with Robert Glasper at the International  Piano Trio Festival. His appointment as guest resident Musical  Director at London jazz clubs “Jazz Café” and “Ronnie Scotts” and  nominations for the Jazz FM Awards in two categories in addition to  being named “Breakthrough Act of the Year” by Fader Magazine secured  his big break in 2017. Adding to this, Ashley Henry’s acclaimed debut  album “Beautiful Vinyl Hunter” further cemented his status as a  multifaceted artist in 2019. If you have any questions, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsProf. Dr Thomas GirstHead of BMW Group Cultural  EngagementTelephone: +49 89 382 24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comWebsite: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.de\n"}

Artist Arash Hanaei and curator Morad    Montazami have been named as winners of the BMW ART MAKERS    programme. Following a call for applications, a shortlist was    created by the jury members and the BMW ART MAKERS team, after which    ten artist-curator duos were interviewed via video conference.The jury unanimously selected the artist-curator duo Arash      Hanaei and Morad Montazami who won them over with their    project entitled “Hantologie post-urbaine” (“Post-urban    hauntology”). The dialogue fostered by the two applicants    demonstrated their synergy and the importance of the curator’s    contribution through his ability to take a step back when    considering the chosen subject. The jury was impressed by the first    series presented in the application that display the decision to    create an installation that combines various visual systems and a    masterful deep-dive into a futurist universe.“Hantologie post-urbaine” is a project that invites us to rethink    our relationship with the utopian architecture of the 1960s and    1970s and the urban ecosystem of the suburbs that host them. This    work is made up of still and moving computer images, evoking the    digital culture through which architectural ghosts pass. Their    socio-political ideal remains in a dream state, but lingers on    through their physical substance. The emphasis is on two parallel    worlds: the suburbs around the city and the virtual world created by    big data.“As winners of the 2022 BMW ART MAKERS programme, we are honoured    by the trust placed in us to successfully create an innovative    installation that proposes poetry and a visual policy that considers    the spectator’s emancipation, in an era of image “capture”, big data    and algorithmic warfare.” Arash Hanaei & Morad MontazamiThe BMW ART MAKERS programme will enable them to carry out      this project.Two heads are better than one. This partnership draws on the    strength of a strong, like-minded duo to generate the trust and    competitive spirit required for completing a major project from the    initial idea to the end work. Alongside the artist, the curator    performs the roles of artistic director, scenographer and designer    and ensures the project is completed to artistic standards,    timeframe and budget.“The human-machine relationship, creativity, innovation, support    and commitment are all key BMW Group values. In these unpredictable    times, this new art patronage programme speaks for itself: this    artist-curator duo sparks an emotional conversation with our society    and offers a different take through experimentation. We are looking    forward to seeing what Arash Hanaei and Morad Montazami have created    in relation to the post-urban and post-internet world,” Maryse    Bataillard, Head of Corporate Communications and CSR, BMW Group France. The shortlist and trends selected by the BMW ART MAKERS    jury. The jury, made up of Florence Bourgeois,    Director of Paris Photo, Hervé Digne, President of Manifesto,    Chantal Nedjib, Founder of L’image par l’image, and Christoph    Wiesner, Director of the Rencontres d'Arles, was supported in the    selection process for the first BMW ART MAKERS programme by renowned    figures in visual arts: Léa Bismuth, exhibition curator and art    critic, Jérôme Poggi, Galérie Jérôme Poggi, Nathalie Mamane Cohen,    Vice-President of Friends of the Centre Pompidou, and Maryse    Bataillard, Head of Corporate Communications and CSR, BMW Group FranceIn this new programme, the jury members will also act as mentors    and will monitor the project’s development throughout its creation process.The ten shortlisted duos were selected from 125 applicants who    submitted a proposal including a statement of intent, a budget and a    production schedule, scenography and images of their prior works.    These 125 applications demonstrated a wide range of profiles and    work. 43% of applicant duos were mixed, 35% were all-female and 22%    all-male. 47% were French and 53% international, from more than    thirty countries worldwide.The major trends that emerged reflected social issues. Many    projects considered the environment and in particular trees and    water. Society was the focus of proposals on post-colonialism,    feminism, disease and its resilience. Technology was also a common    theme, with a particular emphasis on artificial intelligence.Biographies of the winners Arash Hanaei is an artist who lives and works in    Paris. After growing up and studying in Tehran, he developed a    practice that combines several techniques and media. His series of    “digital drawings” entitled Capital (2009-2016) is a critical map of    the city of Tehran following  the Iran-Iraq war. His work gradually    shifted from documentary practices to inter-media speculations and    post-internet strategies. With the series Cyclothymia of a Land,    Hanaei further provokes dialectic thought between urban cityscapes    and digital landscapes, heightening his art of the visual palimpsest    (including modernist architecture, accounts of war or attacks, video    games, etc.). In recent years, his work has been displayed in solo    exhibitions: Poush Manifesto (Paris), Yassi Foundation (Tehran),    Goethe Institute (New York), etc. He has also contributed to group    exhibitions: Paris Museum of Modern Art (Paris), Palais de Tokyo    (Paris), Potsdam Art Space (Potsdam), MAXXI (Rome), etc. His works    are displayed in several international collections: LACMA Museum    (Los Angeles), Centre national des arts plastiques (France), Paris    Museum of Modern Art (Paris), Peters-Messer (Berlin), Salsali Museum    (Dubai), etc.Morad Montazami is an art historian, editor and    exhibition curator who lives and works in Paris.

{"prompt":"MINI Italy renews its collaboration with Aktivhaus to promote the Biosphera Genesis project, a sustainable housing module focusing on human well-being and reducing the environmental impact of the building construction processes.     ->","completion":" Munich. With MINI VOICES, a platform has been created  to bring together personalities and initiatives that can contribute to  a more sustainable and socially responsible future, providing an  opportunity to promote revolutionary impulses and share them with a  wider global audience.Within this context, MINI Italy has chosen to collaborate with a  partner of excellence in the sustainability and construction sector:  Aktivhaus-Nexlogic Group. The company specialises in the development  of housing modules using the most advanced technologies in the world  focusing on human well-being and reducing the environmental impact of  the building construction processes. The collaboration between MINI  Italy and Aktivhaus began in 2018 and it is renewed today with the  presentation of the fourth generation of the Biosphera Project: Genesis.Mirko Taglietti, CEO of Aktivhaus and creator of the Biosphera  Project, said: \"Genesis is the fourth generation of the  self-sufficient regenerative biophilic housing module which has  already won the Energy Globe Award, the most coveted sustainability  prize in the world. Our main goal is to build and renew new-generation  buildings that put humans, their senses, needs, physiology, health,  and well-being at the center of the architectural and constructive  project. Buildings capable of regenerating its inhabitants’ minds and energy.”As a result of twelve years of research and scientific  experimentation in collaboration with numerous organisations,  universities, and companies, Biosphera Genesis is a 40 square meter  actual self-sufficient container of life - an itinerant living unit  that can be transported by road.  Biosphera Genesis, which was  inaugurated on 8 September 2021 in Venice on the island of San  Servolo, is the only housing module in the world to integrate  Biophilic Design, an architectural design feature aimed at creating a  favourable environment for human health. It is a \"passive\"  house that produces eight times the energy consumed and consumes 95%  less energy than a traditional home. It was built using  environmentally friendly materials and adheres to the Minimum  Environmental Criteria (MEC).Stefano Ronzoni, Director of MINI Italy, said: \"We are delighted  to support Mirko Taglietti and the Biosphera Project. MINI truly cares  for the sustainability theme: the motto ‘BIG LOVE’ represents both the  love we have for others as well as love for the environment and  planet. We believe it is important to raise awareness for initiatives  such as this that can boost everyday life in a sustainable manner”.Biosphera Genesis is the first sensory growth chamber dedicated to  the hotel industry, designed to combat stress. Inside of it, the  visual, tactile and olfactory atmospheres found in nature are  recreated through immersive experiences, demonstrating how it is  possible to create an environment that positively affects our five  senses. From the use of technologies that recreate the same conditions  of light, temperature and colours between indoors and outdoors  respecting the circadian rhythm, to the use of a virtual reality that  reproduces sounds and scenarios existing in nature thanks to special  headphones. Finally, the presence of Swiss pine wood, as an olfactory  stimulator, helps the body to relax and to slow down the heartbeat.Biosphera is an Italian project born to merge medicine and  architecture, with sustainability at its core.

{"prompt":"As of February 1st 2022, Stefanie Wurst takes over the management of the MINI brand. Her predecessor Bernd Körber will now head BMW Product Management and the Connected Company. Strategic further development of the British premium brand with a focus on new markets and target groups as well as electromobility and digitalization will be consistently continued. ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group announces a personnel change at  the top of the MINI brand. As of 1 February 1st 2022, Stefanie Wurst  will take over the management of the British premium brand. She  succeeds Bernd Körber, who has held this position since April 2019 and  now assumes responsibility for the BMW Product Management and the  Connected Company as of February 1st 2022.Stefanie Wurst returned to Munich after being CEO BMW Group Nederland  since September 2018. Under her leadership, numerous sustainability  issues were actively promoted. Among others, she successfully  initiated the \"Electric City Drive\", which became a pilot  project for approximately 100 BMW eDrive Zones in Europe, which  support drivers of plug-in hybrid models in the use of the  all-electric driving mode in inner city areas. \"Sustainability is  a holistic task and an attitude that everyone feels committed  to,\" says Stefanie Wurst.The share of electrified models in the total sales of the BMW Group  in the Netherlands increased to a new record of 37 percent in 2021. At  the same time, the fully-electric MINI Cooper SE (combined power  consumption: 17.6 – 15.2 kWh\/100 km according to WLTP, CO2 emissions  combined: 0 g\/km) accounted for 21.5 percent of all new registrations  of the MINI brand in the Netherlands in the past year. At MINI this approach is reflected in an approach that considers  sustainability along the entire value chain, from the extraction of  raw materials to the production and operation of the vehicle to  subsequent recycling. MINI is making great strides in the expansion of  electromobility. In 2021, global sales of the fully-electric MINI  Cooper SE were almost doubled. As early as the early 2030s, MINI will  be making the transition to a fully electrified brand. Stefanie Wurst will contribute her experience in the field of  holistic corporate management in the interaction of all disciplines  and together with our trading partners. From 2014 to 2018, the  graduate economist was responsible for BMW's marketing of the German  automotive market. During this period, both the brand strength in  general and the perception of innovation of the BMW brand, including  the sustainability perception, increased. Prior to joining BMW Group,  she held various senior positions internationally, including in  Singapore for the Asian market. In her new role, she succeeds Bernd Körber, under whose direction the  future strategy of the MINI brand was developed. Among other things,  it includes a realignment of the product range, which includes  electrified models as well as new offers in the crossover and premium  compact segments. The next generation of the MINI Countryman will  roll-off the production line at the BMW Group plant in Leipzig from  2023 – with both electric and internal combustion engines. In  addition, MINI is stepping up its commitment to the Chinese automotive  market, including the launch of local production. Production of a new  generation of all-electric models from the brand will also begin there  in 2023. MINI is thus taking another step towards becoming an  all-electric brand.A central element of the realignment of MINI's brand image is the  emphasis on diversity, tolerance, cosmopolitanism, optimism and  enthusiasm for new things, which is expressed by the current campaign  motto BIGLOVE. The positive emotionality divides the brand with the  MINI community, in which individuality and a sense of community are  harmoniously in sync with each other. Innovations in the field of  digitalization and networking also contribute to the brand's future viability.This not only strengthens the relationship between customer and  vehicle, but also the brand's connection to the global MINI community.  With its strategic choices in the fields of product, brand and  customer as well as technology and production, MINI has a solid basis  for sustainable profitable growth of the brand.\n"}
{"prompt":" BMW Group expands sourcing of low-carbon steel: Agreement with Salzgitter AG provides for delivery of low-carbon steel from 2026  Salzgitter AG and H2 Green Steel will meet more than 40% of steel demand for standard production at BMW Group’s EU plants, saving around 400,000 tonnes of CO2 per year  Steel remnants from plants will be reused in circular economy  Post: “Another important step in reducing CO2 emissions in the supplier network”   ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group continues to reduce  CO2 emissions in its supplier network as part of its  ambitious ongoing sustainability activities. Steel produced using  natural gas or hydrogen and green power, instead of fossil resources  like coal, makes a vital contribution to this. The BMW Group has now  signed a corresponding agreement with Salzgitter AG for delivery of  low-carbon steel. The steel will be used in standard production of  cars at the BMW Group’s European plants from 2026 onwards. With this  move, the BMW Group is expanding its sourcing of low-carbon steel to  two suppliers. The aim is to use low-carbon steel to meet over 40% of  demand at its European plants by 2030, thereby reducing CO2  emissions by up to 400,000 tonnes per year.“This is an important step in substantially reducing CO2  emissions at source in the supplier network,” said Joachim Post,  member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing  and Supplier Network. “Our aim is to reduce vehicles’ lifecycle carbon  footprint with a holistic approach. With steel, in particular, we are  leading the way by sourcing low-carbon steel for our plants in Europe  in the future.”“Salzgitter AG is putting ‘circularity’ at the centre of its new  strategy,” said Gunnar Groebler, CEO of Salzgitter AG. “We firmly  believe that closed loops of recoverable materials can only realise  their full effect with strong partners. We are delighted about the  circular economy cooperation with the BMW Group and the agreement to  supply green steel to our long-standing customer. Partnering for  Transformation – this is how we will translate our new corporate  vision into practice.” Agreements with two suppliers on low-carbon steel will meet    over 40% of steel demand at European plants The BMW Group already signed an agreement with Swedish startup H2  Green Steel in October of last year. H2 Green Steel will supply the  BMW Group’s European plants with steel produced exclusively using  hydrogen and green power from renewable energies from 2025 onwards.  This process will reduce CO2 emissions by around 95%.Together, the two agreements will supply over 40% of the steel  required by the company’s European plants and save around 400,000  tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. BMW Group press plants in  Europe process more than half a million tonnes of steel per year. Gradual transition to low-carbon steel production Due to its energy-intensive manufacturing process, steel production  generates high CO2 emissions. However, because of its  versatility, steel is one of the most important materials for car  production and will continue to account for a large proportion of the  body and many components.To lower CO2 emissions from steel production on a massive  scale, Salzgitter AG is gradually switching to virtually carbon-free  production. Electricity from renewable sources and its use in  production of hydrogen from electrolysis are key elements of the  transformation. This green hydrogen will replace the coal currently  used in the conventional blast-furnace process. This is made possible  by so-called direct reduction plants, which use hydrogen to directly  reduce iron ore to iron in the solid state. The solid iron produced in  this way is then melted down with steel scrap in an electric arc  furnace powered by renewable electricity.Salzgitter AG plans to use this method to gradually reduce  CO2 emissions from steel production to around 5% of what  they originally were. Closed loop conserves resources and reduces CO2 emissionsThe BMW Group already established a closed-loop material cycle for  sheet steel waste from BMW Group Plant Leipzig with Salzgitter AG more  than five years ago. After delivering steel coils to the plant,  Salzgitter AG takes away steel remnants of the kind produced at press  plants, for example, when doors are punched out, and uses this  material to produce new steel. This steel is then supplied to the BMW  Group plants. In this way, raw materials can be used multiple times in  a circular economy, thereby conserving natural resources.Sheet steel waste from the BMW Group’s other European plants is also  either reused through a direct material cycle or sent back to the  steel producer via steel traders and processed into new steel. Use of secondary steel from circular economy reduces    CO2 emissionsUp to a quarter of the steel in BMW Group vehicles already comes from  recycling loops. The BMW Group plans to increase its percentage of  secondary steel in stages, reaching up to 50% by 2030.Since this requires significantly less energy, CO2  emissions from production of secondary steel are an average of 50-80%  lower than from primary steel. Investment in startups accelerates development of new    technologies In addition to sourcing low-carbon steel, the BMW Group has also  invested in an innovative method for carbon-free steel production  developed by American startup Boston Metal, through its venture  capital fund, BMW i Ventures. Boston Metal uses electricity for its  new technology, which, by means of an electrolysis cell, produces  molten iron that is later processed into steel. If electricity from  renewable energies is used for this process, then steel production is  carbon-free. Over the coming years, Boston Metal plans to expand the  new method for steel production on an industrial scale.Through its investment in startups, the BMW Group aims to accelerate  development of new technologies, promote competition and provide  impetus that will make it easier for young companies to enter the  market. Innovative technologies provide better, more sustainable and  more efficient access to raw materials.Investing in new technologies is one of many steps the BMW Group is  taking to meet its ambitious targets for the steel supply chain – for  example, by making low-carbon production an important award criterion  for every contract.\n"}
{"prompt":"The first 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) proved to be a tough test for the BMW M Motorsport teams and the new BMW M4 GT3. After a race full of challenges, BMW M Team RLL’s two MOTUL BMW M4 GT3s crossed the finish line in seventh and ninth places in the GTD-PRO class.  ->","completion":" Daytona. The first 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) proved to be a    tough test for the BMW M Motorsport teams and the new BMW M4 GT3.    After a race full of challenges, BMW M Team RLL’s two MOTUL BMW M4    GT3s crossed the finish line in seventh and ninth places in the    GTD-PRO class. Both cars suffered issues with their underbodies    early in the race. Work had to be carried out on the rear diffusor    multiple times which cost a lot of time and saw both cars drop well    down the field. Turner Motorsport made an impressive fightback in    the GTD class and was running in the top five until they were forced    to retire after an incident in the night. “That was a tough race,” said Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport.  “We wanted to keep the number of mistakes to a minimum and, if  possible, to get all the BMW M4 GT3s through the race without any  incidents. Unfortunately, we did not quite manage that. The GTD car  run by Turner Motorsport was unable to finish the race after contact,  and both of BMW M Team RLL’s cars encountered problems and ended the  race in seventh and ninth place. Although we did a lot of test  kilometres during the development phase, this showed that an outing  under race conditions poses additional challenges. We must work  together to improve the reliability, operations and performance, as we  were unable to match the pace of the leaders at any point in the race.  We will now analyse all the findings to ensure that we return to the  front again at the 12 Hours of Sebring. I would like to congratulate  Team Pfaff Motorsports on its victory in the first race of the new  GTD-PRO class. Today was my last race outing with BMW M Motorsport. I  would have liked to have bid farewell with a top result. I want to  thank all my colleagues, the teams and drivers for the trustworthy  cooperation over the past few years.” Sharing the driving duties in the #25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3 were John  Edwards, Connor De Phillippi (both USA), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and  Jesse Krohn (FIN). They finished seventh in their class after 698  laps. The second car, with Philipp Eng (AUT), Sheldon van der Linde  (RSA), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) at the wheel, came  home ninth in the GTD-PRO class. In the GTD class, the #96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3 started from  the back of the field but they went on the offensive in the first few  hours and managed to fight their way back into the top five.  Alternating in the cockpit were Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley, Michael  Dinan (all USA) and BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER). The car  was damaged in a collision in the night however, and consequently had  to be parked up in the garage. BMW M Team RLL and Turner Motorsport now have roughly six weeks until  the second highlight of this season’s IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar  Championship at Sebring (USA). They will be joined there by Paul  Miller Racing with a BMW M4 GT3 in the GTD class. Focus on the BMW M anniversary and BMW M Endurance Challenge.On the support programme for the Rolex 24 At Daytona, BMW M  Motorsport and BMW of North America marked 50 years of BMW M with a  host of highlights. Immediately before the start of the race, there  was a parade of vintage and current BMW M cars, including a BMW M1  from 1980. Three race cars that made history by winning IMSA races  were on display at the Rolex 24 Heritage Exhibition in the Daytona Fan  Zone: the BMW 3.0 CSL from 1975, the 2015 BMW Z4 GTLM, and the BMW M8  GTE that triumphed at Daytona in 2019. The BMW M Endurance Challenge took place on Friday. The four-hour  race, round one of this season’s IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge, was  started by Timo Resch, Vice President Customer, Brand and Sales at BMW  M GmbH, in his role as Grand Marshal. Victory went to Team RS1. Turner  Motorsport also impressed with its two BMW M4 GT4s and made it onto  the podium, with Bill Auberlen and Dillon Machavern (both USA)  finishing third. Their team-mates Robby Foley, Michael Dinan and  Vincent Barletta (all USA) were fifth. Quotes after the 24 Hours of Daytona: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW M Team RLL): “That  was a long day for us. It was the first race with the new car for our  team. Prior to this, we had only had one short test at Daytona in  December 2021 and were a little surprised that we did not have the  problems back then that have slowed us down here in Rolex 24. A big  thank you goes to my team, the drivers, BMW M Motorsport, and all  those who never gave up during the past 36 hours and tried to get the  best possible out of the car. We now have a very long to do list which  we must work through in order to challenge at the front in Sebring.” John Edwards (#25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, 7th place    GTD-PRO class): “That was a difficult race for us from the  start. We did not have the necessary pace, and then came the issues  with the diffusor. The result is obviously not what we wanted, but I  am very proud of the guys, who never gave up. Seventh place still  earned us some decent points in the overall standings. Hopefully we  can up our game in Sebring and take a step forward in the championship.” Marco Wittmann (#24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3, 9th place    GTD-PRO class): “That was not the race we were hoping for.  Despite that, we never lost our fantastic team spirit. After the early  problems, we tried to view the race as a test, gain experience and get  the car through to the finish. It is obviously a shame that we lost an  awful lot of time, first through the damage to the diffusor and then  later through a puncture and its consequences. Nevertheless, we have a  lot to build on looking ahead to the coming races. Hopefully things  will run smoother in the future!” Jens Klingmann (#96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3, DNF GTD  class): “For the IMSA season, the 24 Hours of Daytona is  pretty much the equivalent of the Super Bowl – the highlight of the  season and a really tough test at the same time. There were four of us  in one Turner Motorsport car for the first time, and we had fought  back strongly to make it into the top five until our retirement. My  team-mates were all basically very happy with the driveability,  user-friendliness and ergonomics of the BMW M4 GT3. That gives me  reason to be positive. It is obviously a shame that we had to park the  car up after our contact, but we showed that we have the potential to  compete at the very front of the field in our class.”\n"}

The new BMW M4 GT3 is set to    make its debut at the endurance classic in Florida. BMW M Team RLL    and Turner Motorsport were in action last weekend at the test and    qualifying event, Roar Before the 24, where they secured their start    positions for the 24-hour race. The big race is the perfect stage on    which to mark the 50-year anniversary of BMW M GmbH, which will    celebrate the occasion with a top-class programme both on and off    the track. The sporting foundations for the coming weekend were laid over the  last few days, within the many test sessions and the 100-minute  qualifying race. The two MOTUL BMW M4 GT3s run by BMW M Team RLL  qualified 12th and 13th in the GTD-PRO class. At the wheel of the #24  car were BMW M works drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Nick  Yelloly (GBR), gaining as much experience as possible. Their  team-mates Marco Wittmann (GER) and Philipp Eng (AUT) were only in  action in the test sessions. In the #25 car, Augusto Farfus (BRA) and  Jesse Krohn (FIN) skipped the qualifying race, while John Edwards and  Connor De Phillippi (both USA) shared the cockpit.

There are a lot of good drivers in  GTD PRO and we’re looking forward to the competition.” Sheldon van der Linde (#24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “Not a  great qualifying race for us. Obviously, we would have liked to be  further up on the grid. Our job is to make sure that everything runs  smoothly within the team. For me personally it’s the first race with  the RLL team, so I was getting to know everybody during these days. My  first time with BMW M Motorsport at Daytona means there’s a lot left  for me to learn.” Nick Yelloly (#24 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “We could see in  the qualifying race where we are at the moment – and that’s not where  we want to be. Now we have to stick our heads together in the days to  come. In general, it’s pleasure to drive the BMW M4 GT3 and work with  BMW M Team RLL. Now we just have to find some speed.” John Edwards (#25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “The qualifying  race didn’t end up great but fortunately there are no points awarded  for it. Now we have a week ahead of us where we’ll put our heads down  and prepare for the 24-hour race to go for the result when it counts.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 MOTUL BMW M4 GT3): “Not the  result we wanted, obviously. We executed well and had a clean race. We  just didn’t have the package to challenge for top positions. Let’s  hope it will be different next weekend and we can put on a fight.” Jens Klingmann (#96 Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT3):  “For us the focus was on set-up work. It’s important to find a good  balance between racing day and night. There are still a lot of things  to learn and discover with the new car. I think we made good progress  and the car is in a good window. It is easy to drive which is  important for a 24-hour race. Now we just got to make it fast. I am  confident we’ll get there soon.”\n"}

With their independent body  concepts, the three top models each embody an individual expression of  M of typical performance in the prestigious competitive environment of  luxury sports cars.Their central common feature is the drive and chassis technology  designed for an extremely emotional driving experience. Power for  outstanding performance is provided by a V8 engine with M TwinPower  Turbo technology, which mobilizes a maximum output of 460 kW\/625 hp  and a maximum torque of 750 Nm.

Their precise coordination enables exciting sporty  driving manoeuvres, such as accelerating from a standstill to 100 km\/h  in just 3.2 seconds (BMW M8 Competition Coupé and BMW M8 Competition  Gran Coupé) or 3.3 seconds (BMW M8 Competition Cabriolet).A chassis technology developed with racing know-how and tailored to  each model guarantees the characteristic harmony of dynamics, agility  and precision in driving behaviour of BMW M Automobile in every  situation.

{"prompt":"Originating from a dedicated team at MINI Plant Oxford, sustainable driving fun is now being created in a classic car. An electric motor for the original Mini combines tradition with pioneering technology - all in the spirit of circular economy. ->","completion":" Munich. If Alec Issigonis could design the classic  Mini again today, the iconic small car would have an electric motor.  After all, the original launched in 1959 was created during an oil  crisis and based on the idea of saving fuel and transporting four  occupants and their luggage in the smallest possible footprint. To  this day, MINI remains linked to the principles of designer Issigonis  with its creative use of space and driving fun. The MINI Recharged  project is an opportunity to continue telling the story of the classic  Mini in the 21st century, in a sustainable way.The conversion of classic Minis to an electric drive combines  traditional values with future-oriented technology. The idea was born  even before the British premium manufacturer had a fully electric car  on offer with the MINI Cooper SE (electricity consumption  combined:17.6 - 15.2 kWh\/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions  combined: 0 g\/km.). As a one-off, a classic Mini Electric was built in  2018 and presented at the New York Auto Show. The reactions were so  positive that a dedicated team from MINI Plant Oxford set to work and  developed the plan to make a corresponding offer available to  customers who own a classic Mini.To experience traditional go-kart handling with an emission-free  drivetrain, the original petrol engine of the classic Mini is replaced  by a modern electric drive. Only reversible changes are made to the  substance of the vehicle during the conversion as part of MINI  Recharged. Careful handling of the historical heritage is an important  part of the concept. This makes it possible to restore the classic  Mini to its original condition at a later date. During the conversion,  the original engine of each vehicle is marked and stored so it can be  reused in the event of a future retrofit of the classic Mini.\"What the project team are developing preserves the character of  the classic Mini and enables its fans to enjoy all-electric  performance. With MINI Recharged, we are connecting the past with the  future of the brand,\" says Bernd Körber, Head of the MINI Brand.The MINI Recharged project means a vehicle's life can be extended in  a sustainable way. A classic Mini can now be given a new lease of  life, accompanying its owner into the future, whilst maintaining its  much-loved heritage. The drive is a modern electric motor that  generates a continuous output of up to 90 kW and accelerates the  electrified classic Mini from zero to 100 km\/h in approximately nine  seconds. The energy is supplied by a high-voltage battery, which can  be charged with an output of up to 6.6 kW and enables a predicted  range of around 160 kilometers. In addition, every electrified classic  Mini from MINI Recharged receives the characteristic central  instrument cluster, familiar since the early days of the classic,  which now displays the drive temperature, the selected gear, range and speed.MINI Recharged fans gain a whole new driving experience; a silent  drivetrain with instant acceleration and the ability to enter the  electric or low-emission driving zones of many large cities, otherwise  inaccessible with a combustion engine. For example, the electric  classic Mini can drive in Oxford Street or Piccadilly Circus in  London, and once again be part of the cityscape, without the driver  having to pay an environmental tax (congestion charge) beforehand. In  addition, the electric classic conversion does not need a new registration.MINI Recharged fits seamlessly into the brand's future strategy,  which also includes the aspect of circular economy. For this project,  no new vehicles are being produced, instead they are being created  from much-loved, existing cars. It allows a classic Mini to begin a  second, more sustainable life. Today, one in five new MINI models has  an electrified drive and now the MINI Recharged project will allow the  love of the brand's classic vehicles to become an experience combining  the past and the future.The bespoke upcycling of the classic Mini is carried out exclusively  in the United Kingdom. Each converted vehicle is given an individual  number, making it unique. \"Individuality also plays an important  role with MINI Recharged,\" says Sebastian Beuchel, Head of MINI  Global Brand Management. \"Unique classic Mini models have always  been created, including true works of art on wheels. That's why future  collaborations are also planned as part of the MINI Recharged  programme, allowing well-known artists to express their creativity  with specially designed classic Mini models.\"   In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product Communications MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com  The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the    BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles    and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility    services.

Sales of the  traditionally strong R Series increased significantly overall.

The new flagship from BMW M Motorsport has passed the    endurance test in the desert. Following test races last season and    successful FIA homologation, the 24H Dubai (UAE) from Friday to    Saturday marked the first race appearance for the new BMW M4 GT3 in    the hands of BMW M Motorsport teams. ST Racing and Schubert    Motorsport competed with a total of three BMW M4 GT3s at the    season-opener in the 24H Series. After 24 hours of racing featuring    numerous Code 60 periods and a sandstorm on Saturday morning, all    three cars reached the finish line on their racing debut.  ST Racing secured ninth place with the #28 BMW M4 GT3 in the top  category, the GT3 class. The car was driven by Jon Miller (USA), Nick  Wittmer (CAN), Louis-Philippe Montour (CAN) and Chandler Hull (USA).  Schubert Motorsport suffered a setback early in the race when the #30  BMW M4 GT3 was damaged after contact from another competitor. The  subsequent long repair break saw the #30 fall way back. After 24  hours, BMW M works driver Nick Yelloly (GBR), Jordan Witt (GBR),  Marcel Lenerz (GER) and Jens Liebhauser (GER) crossed the line tenth  in the GT3 class. The #1 car from ST Racing, competing in the Pro-Am class, was the  best-placed BMW M4 GT3 in the field for a large part of the race and  was on course for a podium in its class. However, a technical problem  then cost the car positions, although it was possible to carry out  repairs. The #1, driven by Samantha Tan (CAN), Bryson Morris, Anthony  Lazzaro, Harry Gottsacker and Tyler Maxson (all USA), then finished  fifth in the Pro-Am class. The next highlight for the BMW M4 GT3 is scheduled to take place in  two weeks in North America. At the season-opener in the IMSA  WeatherTech SportsCar Championship (IMSA series), the legendary 24  Hours of Daytona (USA), BMW M Team RLL and Turner Motorsport will be  competing with the new GT car. BMW M Motorsport teams were also competing in Dubai with the BMW M4  GT4 and the BMW M2 CS Racing. They secured multiple podium finishes in  their categories. The RHC Jorgensen-Strom by Century team reached  third place on the rostrum with the #450 BMW M4 GT4 in the GT4 class.  The #429 of Century Motorsport and the #451 from Team AVIA Sorg  Rennsport were right behind in fourth and fifth positions. In the TCX  category, Cogemo\/TLRT finished second with the #255 BMW M2 CS Racing,  ahead of Yeeti Racing with the #208 BMW M2 CS Racing in third  position. Schubert Motorsport claimed sixth place in the same class  with the #200 BMW M2 CS Racing. Reactions to the 24H Dubai. Achim Klein, BMW M Motorsport Project Lead BMW M4 GT3:  “Those were some exciting days for us here in Dubai. The  first official racing appearance for a new car is always something  special, and even though the turbulent events during the race meant  that the final results did not entirely meet our expectations, we can  draw some positive conclusions. Two of the three competing BMW M4 GT3s  were brought to Dubai straight from production, where they were  received by the BMW M Motorsport teams. We also gathered plenty of  valuable knowledge in Dubai, which will help us as we continue to work  on the new car in its debut season. ST Racing and Schubert Motorsport  provided crucial input for this. Now we are looking forward to the  next highlight with the new BMW M4 GT3, the 24 Hours of Daytona in two weeks.” Kenneth Tan, ST Racing Team Principal: “The BMW M4  GT3 is potentially very competitive. We saw it in the early stages of  the race; we were in the top five for quite a while and in the first  half of the race we always were up in the overall top ten, so we know  that the BMW M4 GT3 has the potential. At the moment, our car is still  not there obviously. We just got the car straight from the factory and  started working with it here at the track. We have a long list of  things we want to do to develop it further for the next race at  Mugello and I am very excited about that because I know where we can  get this car to. The other part is of course our team. It has expanded  and we needed to work together in a GT3 setting and we did that. We  worked really well. We achieved the objectives we came here for. It  would have been nice to be on the podium but we always knew that it’s  a new car and that there are so many unknowns at the beginning. We  finished the race and that’s amazing. I am very happy.” Torsten Schubert, Schubert Motorsport Team Principal:  “We knew that the first race would be a challenge. We began  testing on Tuesday here in Dubai. It was important for us to work with  the car under racing conditions. That is better than any rollout where  you are working alone out on the track. We have learned a lot.  Unfortunately, there was an accident when we were hit by a competitor.  A top ten finish in the overall standings would otherwise have been  possible, and I could hardly have wished for a better result than  that. The BMW M4 GT3 is a very balanced car. Apart from a few minor  issues, which you always get with a new car, we had no problems. I am  particularly pleased with our performance with our BMW M2 CS Racing.  This was the first time that I had driven in a 24-hour race with my  two sons as a three-driver line-up. We are happy that we made it  through to the finish with virtually no hiccups” Nick Wittmer, #28 BMW M4 GT3, ST Racing: “This was my  first time driving a GT3 and for a team that wants to buy a GT3 this  car is very user-friendly. It did not take me much time to look around  at all the buttons. It is very easy to learn and I really like the  functions on the BMW M4 GT3. A lot of functions were new to me so they  were things I had to learn. Despite not having the GT3 experience it  was very fun and easy to drive the BMW M4 GT3 on track. For sure we  need to develop the set-ups and all that by tracks and learn more  about the car. I did a lot of track-time out there, I learnt a lot  throughout the week and improved a lot. Overall, we just need to  fine-tune a little bit and we will be up there for sure. We have a  very strong car.” Samantha Tan, #1 BMW M4 GT3, ST Racing: “It was  incredible to be one of the first drivers to race this car officially  in the world. It was quite overwhelming to switch from the GT4 to the  GT3 but with the focus on us teams I feel that I adapted very quickly  to the BMW M4 GT3. The biggest difference for me was all the  technology, how much we could really fine-tune all the different  settings for the drivers. Obviously there were still a lot of things  that I needed to learn this weekend but overall it was great. I think  that I ran a very great pace throughout the night. The car has a lot  of potential. We just need to put in more work and more development on  our side and I will think we will have a great car for the next race  at Mugello.” Nick Yelloly, #30 BMW M4 GT3, Schubert Motorsport:  “We take some positives with us moving to Daytona. We know  that the car can work very well; all the development and testing that  we did over the past 18 months paid off well so I am very happy about  that. Now it is just about fine-tuning everything with the new car and  I am sure that it will be a multiple race and championship winner in  the years to come. Even if the final result was a bit frustrating  considering the pace that we could show, especially at the end, I am  pretty happy. The team did a fantastic job. Only one small roll-out  and then straight away finishing a 24-hour race is a great achievement.” \n"}

{"prompt":"Exclusive custom bikes were developed by two famous Italian customizers with support of BMW Motorrad Italia and the dealer network. ->","completion":" Munich\/Verona. The Verona Motor Bike Expo has been  the perfect stage to bring to the eyes of Italian and European  enthusiasts two exclusive motorcycle customization projects based on  the iconic BMW R 18.These are the result of the collaboration of BMW Motorrad Italy  and its dealer network with some of the historical players of this  world.The R 18 M is a project developed by Italian Magazine LowRide  and created by American Dreams. The R 18 Aurora, was created by Garage  221 that was engaged by BMW Motorrad Roma.BMW R 18 M.M is the letter that distinguished the sport versions of BMW  four-wheeled models, and today it also includes two-wheeled vehicles.  The source of inspiration for the BMW R 18 M project by the editorial  staff of LowRide is the following: the idea is to give the BMW Cruiser  a more streamlined and sportier look, avoiding exaggerations and  especially without forgetting the reference to the BMW R 18 retro lines.\"Stability, long wheelbase and readiness of the 1800 cc big  boxer instigate lightning starts and deserve, in our opinion, a sporty  and retro look. In the R 18 M design, we find suggestions from BMW  Motorrad tradition and cues from the four-wheelers: M stands for  Motorsport” as Giuseppe Roncen, director of LowRide and a great expert  of the world of specials, described the BMW R 18 M project.The work has focused on chassis, suspension set-up, bodywork,  and accessories, leaving mechanics and electronics unchanged as the  natural strengths of the R 18. Lightened and with a different riding  position, the BMW R 18 M promises to be even more fun to ride:  \"We remain curious to experience its potential. Significantly  lightened, the bike should also be easy to handle due to its riding  position, which is more compact and forward loaded, without exaggeration.\"Built by many hands, from designers to experienced craftsmen.The R 18 M project was made possible by BMW Italia and was born  in the wake of the emotions that this bike can give: a fun cruiser,  powerful and lively, with a big heart and an infinite torque. LowRide  has involved some of the best Italian craftsmanship and companies  specialized in the sector. The realization of the sketches was  entrusted to designer Oberdan Bezzi, already a partner of LowRide in  the past. He has managed to make it an exciting power cruiser without  upsetting the essence of the BMW R 18. American Dreams handled the  assembly and coordinated the work; Elaboratorio, specializing in  prototyping and modeling, created tail, tip and fiberglass windshield  from scratch. Carbon Italy handled the head covers, intake ducts, and  other carbon fiber details. The short exhaust pipe, designed to make  the line more compact and allow greater lean angles, bears the  signature of ER Exhaust Revolution. The short exhaust pipes also give  greater prominence to the splendid uncovered nickel-plated shaft, an  evocative detail that deserves to be highlighted. L.R. Leather covered  the saddle in leather, while the paintwork was entrusted to Dox Art  Factory. Rizoma provided mirrors, grips, and universal indicators for  the accessories, perfectly in line with the bike's character.BMW R 18 Aurora.The idea and desire of Garage 221 to create a custom bike based  on the BMW R 18 found its origins a while ago, at the presentation of  the bike at EICMA 2019. The lines of the new BMW cruiser, innovative  and at the same time faithfully traditional, deserved  \"complementary elements and an even more Heritage spirit,  starting from the soft lines of the tank to the characteristic shapes  of the boxer,\" in the opinion of Pier Francesco Marchio of Garage 221.The project initially focused on the study of the different  sections of the bike, keeping in mind the need to connect the new  elements in a unique harmony of lines, taking inspiration from the  cruisers of the 1970s, which have always particularly involved Pier  Francesco \"for their impressive aesthetic fluidity.\"  Distinctive elements of the BMW R 18 Aurora by Garage 221 are  the wraparound fenders and adherent to the wheel, like the  \"batwing\", to leave space and thus highlight the central  area of the bike.A Custom with the BMW tradition at its core.The modifications that led to the R 18 Aurora stem from Garage  221's experience in the BMW world and indeed all used elements come  from other models of BMW Motorrad. The saddle was borrowed in its  entirety from a BMW 1200 C of 2005, the Batwing supports were made  using the supports for indicators of a BMW R 100 of 1982 and a part of  the rear frame of a BMW K 75 of 1991. Even for the color of the body,  the code of a 1983 BMW RT 100 was taken as a reference, customizing  the graphics in its shades and intensity. The front and rear fender  supports, saddle supports, and license plate holder arms are entirely handmade.The exhaust pipes were made in collaboration with Leo Vince,  taking particular care of the sound, to make it even more full-bodied  and captivating. Their design has been specifically studied to give a  very personal and muscular line to the central part of the R 18.  The R 18 Aurora's oil cooler grille gives a classy natural touch,  inspired by the grille of BMW's cars from the 1960s. \"It was a  lot of hard work,\" said Pier Francesco, \"but the result is  truly stunning. The textured paintwork of the cylinder head covers,  the injection housings, the central crankcase and our oil cooler  grille make everything look homogeneous, creating a unique effect with  the cylinder block and the bevel gear.\"Disclaimer.The vehicles shown may be modified  and fitted with third-party accessories and\/or proprietary parts that  are not manufactured, distributed or tested by BMW.

{"prompt":"HeyCharge’s Technology Cuts Costs and Increases Scalability of Charging Options Underground ->","completion":" Munich\/ Mountain View, Calif. BMW i Ventures announced today  a lead investment in HeyCharge, the German start-up democratizing  access to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in apartment  complexes, office buildings and other infrastructure locations.  HeyCharge was in Y Combinator’s Summer 2021 batch of start-ups. “The rapid growth of the electric vehicle market in coming years will  necessitate greater infrastructure build-out of charging solutions  around the globe,” said Kasper Sage, Managing Partner, BMW i Ventures.  “HeyCharge is the first company to enable EV-charging without internet  connection, which is a key enabler to cover untapped white-spots. With  HeyCharge's technology, it becomes attractive to install chargers in  locations that before would have not been commercially viable.\" Traditionally, EV chargers require an app or RFID card and a proper  internet connection to begin activation. Yet most underground garages  currently do not have an internet access point, or the ability to  install such boxes. Chris Cardé, Founder and CEO, HeyCharge,  recognized the problem with this traditional system and the  opportunity to solve it after bringing his first EV home to a Munich  apartment building. As the amount of EVs on the road increases – by  2040, virtually every new car sold globally will be electric – there  will be a large need for a scalable charging option that fits into  consumers' everyday lives. With 56% of Germany and 46% of Europe living in apartment  buildings, and 37% of renters in the US, this is an obvious next step  for the expansion of EV charging stations, but the current reliance on  internet connectivity is holding scalability back. That’s why  HeyCharge has made its mission to help get a cheap, commercial,  scalable solution to this section of the population.  HeyCharge’s patent-pending technology, SecureCharge, eliminates the  need for an on-site internet connection, allowing the app and chargers  to communicate directly over bluetooth with the HeyCharge App or SDK.  This maximizes availability of the system while minimizing latency  between the phone and the charger. When combined with Access Point,  HeyCharge’s simple and effective hardware component, total costs can  be reduced up to 80% in buildings. “In addition to our full wallbox, the HeyCharge Access Point is a    bring your own wallbox device that places the bare minimum  for access control and consumption invoicing on the building side,  allowing for a fast and easy installation that can be made by any  electrician in minutes,” said Chris Cardé, Founder and CEO, HeyCharge.  “We are excited to use this investment to scale our product globally  and bring low-cost charging options to consumers.” HeyCharge’s  solution makes EV charging not just scalable but also more  cost-effective and accessible so that easy EV charging is made  possible wherever you live or work, said Chris Cardé, Founder and CEO,  HeyCharge. “We are thrilled to be working with BMW i Ventures in this  round and look forward to using this investment to scale our product  globally and bring low-cost charging options to consumers.”  About BMW i Ventures BMW i Ventures is BMW Group’s venture capital firm, investing money  and resources in startups in the fields of Transportation,  Manufacturing, Supply Chain and Sustainability. The firm has made many  successful investments over the years in companies such as Bright  Machines, Blackmore, Chargepoint, Graphcore, Urgent.ly, Proterra,  Solid Power, Tekion, Xometry and many more.

{"prompt":"Sales growth continued in 2021 – BMW M GmbH was the global market leader in the performance car and high-performance car segment for the third year running – Spotlight in the brand’s 50th anniversary year centres on the latest round of new products, alluring special-edition models and the next stage in the electrification offensive. ->","completion":" Munich. For the third time in a row, BMW M GmbH ended  the financial year as the global market leader in the performance and  high-performance car segment. Indeed, the company posted record sales  once again in 2021. A total of 163,542 BMW M cars were delivered to  customers worldwide last year, a 13 percent increase on 2020.This growth was spread equally between the High-Performance sports  cars and Performance cars made by BMW M GmbH, with both product  categories raising their sales figures to a new level. “This success  is the perfect start to our anniversary year,” says Franciscus van  Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “M is in a stronger position than ever as it  celebrates its 50th birthday.”New BMW M3 and new BMW M4 enjoy immediate success.The biggest drivers of growth among the High-Performance sports cars  were the new BMW M3 and BMW M4 models introduced in spring 2021.  Fuelled by a vehicle concept focused squarely on emotionally charged  dynamism and unprecedented diversity in the model range, the new BMW  M3 Sedan (fuel consumption combined: 10.2 – 10.0 l\/100 km [27.7 – 28.3  mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 231 – 227 g\/km as per  WLTP), new BMW M4 Coupé (fuel consumption combined: 10.1 – 9.9 l\/100  km [28.0 – 28.5 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined:  230 – 226 g\/km as per WLTP) and new BMW M4 Convertible (fuel  consumption combined: 10.2 l\/100 km [27.7 mpg imp]; CO2  emissions combined: 233 – 231 g\/km as per WLTP) got off to an  extremely successful start. The latest model generation is the first  to offer customers two output levels topping out at 375 kW\/510 hp, the  M xDrive all-wheel-drive system and a choice of either a six-speed  manual gearbox or the eight-speed M Steptronic transmission.“The response to the new generation of the BMW M3 and BMW M4 has been  simply overwhelming,” reports Timo Resch, Vice President Customer,  Brand and Sales at BMW M GmbH. “We can therefore expect demand for  these iconic sports cars to continue on an upward curve in 2022.”Also making a powerful contribution to the latest rise in  High-Performance model sales at BMW M GmbH were the BMW X5 M  Competition (fuel consumption combined: 13.6 – 13.3 l\/100 km [20.8  – 21,2 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 308 – 303 g\/km as  per WLTP) and BMW X6 M Competition (fuel consumption combined:  13.4 – 13.1 l\/100 km [21.1 – 21.6 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions  combined: 305 – 299 g\/km as per WLTP). Following the successful market  launch of the latest model generation the previous year, the  charismatic High-Performance sports cars in the Sports Activity  Vehicle and Sports Activity Coupé segment – both powered by a 460  kW\/625 hp V8 engine – increased their sales figures once again in 2021.Alluring and in demand: the BMW M models in the BMW 4 Series range.The dynamic excellence, agility and precision for which M is renowned  also enabled the brand’s Performance models to delight and excite a  wide range of customers over the past year. Credit for the latest  boost to sales goes above all to the M models based on the new BMW 4  Series. Particularly popular were the variants of the new BMW 4 Series  Coupé, whose line-up consists of the BMW M440i Coupé (fuel consumption  combined: 8.1 – 7.4 l\/100 km [34.8 – 38.2 mpg imp]; CO2  emissions combined: 184 – 167 g\/km as per WLTP) and BMW  M440i xDrive Coupé (fuel consumption combined: 8.2 – 7.5 l\/100 km  [34.5 – 37.7 mpg imp]; CO2 emissions combined:  186 – 170 g\/km as per WLTP) powered by a 275 kW\/374 hp six-cylinder  in-line petrol engine, and the BMW M440d xDrive Coupé (fuel  consumption combined: 6.3 – 5.7 l\/100 km [44.8 – 49.6 mpg imp];  CO2 emissions combined: 165 – 150 g\/km as per WLTP), whose  six-cylinder in-line diesel unit produces 250 kW\/340 hp.The latest BMW X models within the ranks of M’s Performance cars also  proved extremely desirable. Indeed, the BMW X3 M40i powered by a  six-cylinder in-line engine with 265 kW\/360 hp (fuel consumption  combined: 9.5 – 8.8 l\/100 km [29.7 – 32.1 mpg imp]; CO2  emissions combined: 216 – 199 g\/km as per WLTP) and the BMW X7 M50i  (fuel consumption combined: 12.8 – 12.3 l\/100 km [22.1 – 23.0 mpg  imp]; CO2 emissions combined: 292 – 280 g\/km as per WLTP)  with its 390 kW\/530 hp V8 unit both posted an increase in new registrations.Looking ahead to an anniversary year brimming with highlights.BMW M GmbH will continue its product offensive in this anniversary  year with the addition of new High-Performance and Performance models.  Highlights include the new BMW M240i xDrive Coupé (fuel consumption  combined: 8.8 – 8.1 l\/100 km [32.1 – 34.9 mpg imp]; CO2  emissions combined: 200 – 185 g\/km as per WLTP) and the arrival later  in the year of the first BMW M3 Touring and an exclusive  special-edition model based on the new BMW M4 Coupé.In addition, the BMW Group subsidiary – which was founded as BMW  Motorsport GmbH in May 1972 and enjoys the status of an independent  manufacturer – will also drive the transformation to electric  mobility. Following in the tyre tracks of the BMW i4 M50 (electric  power consumption combined: 22.5 – 18.0 kWh\/100 km as per WLTP;  CO2 emissions combined: 0 g\/km) in the first half of 2022  will be the likewise fully electric BMW iX M60 (projected electric  power consumption combined: 24.7 – 21.7 kWh\/100 km as per WLTP;  CO2 emissions combined: 0 g\/km).The most powerful BMW M model ever made points the way to the    future of the brand.The anniversary year will be crowned by the start of production of  the BMW XM. The most powerful BMW M car ever to go into series  production is also the brand’s first High-Performance model to employ  a plug-in hybrid drive system. Its newly developed M Hybrid technology  brings together a V8 engine and a high-performance electric motor to  develop maximum output of 550 kW\/750 hp and peak torque of 1,000 Nm  (737 lb-ft). The design of the BMW XM majors on presence and extrovert  appeal and in so doing sends out a clear statement in the luxury segment.“Our first standalone model since the legendary BMW M1 represents a  complete re-imagining of the high-performance car segment,” says van  Meel. “The BMW XM blends expressive design and progressive interior  luxury with an incomparable driving experience that serves up both  sublime performance and the ability to glide along in near silence in  all-electric mode. In so doing, it provides an inimitable expression  of poise and assurance, and at the same time points the way to the  future of our brand.”\n"}

On the occasion of the Consumer  Electronics Show (CES), BMW will present its Digital Art Mode and will  be the first to bring digital art into vehicles. Internationally  renowned Chinese multimedia artist Cao Fei created the Digital Art  Mode in the year of the 50th anniversary of BMW Cultural Engagement.  Held in Las Vegas from January 5‑8, 2022, CES will be the first event  to showcase the Digital Art Mode inside a BMW iX M60.The Digital Art Mode is part of the all-new My Modes: Their unique  moments enhance BMW’s driving experience by creating a synergy of the  vehicle’s functions and its interior design. Depending on the driving  situation and the overall mood, a holistic user experience featuring  both a functional and an emotional level can be created at the touch  of a button or via voice control. To that end, drive control and  steering control, mood lighting and sound as well as the color scheme  and graphics of the BMW Curved Display are precisely synchronized.A quantum leap for BMW Cultural Engagement: After 50 years and  hundreds of international cooperations, BMW will now introduce art  into its vehicles. The novel Digital Art Mode offers an additional  option for drivers to personalize their driving experience according  to their preferences and interests and enjoy culture in their mobile  day-to-day lives. The Digital Art Mode is the result of an intensive  collaborative process of BMW Group Design and the Chinese multimedia  artist Cao Fei, whose art creates fascinating and sensual, immersive  moments. In 2017, Cao Fei designed the 18th BMW Art Car using the M6  GT3, the first of its kind to be entirely digital in the history of  this unique collection of mobile artworks. With this very first  incorporation of digital art in an automobile, Cao Fei and the BMW  Group are now taking the next step together.The new BMW iX M60 home to a premiere: a digital artwork    symbolizing the deep connection of humankind and  nature.For the very first time, the Digital Art Mode  can be experienced in the new BMW iX M60 at this year’s CES. The  feature will be made available for other BMW series vehicles in 2022.  Selected models will be available with the Digital Art Mode as a  customized optional feature configurated directly ex work, while  others can be retrofitted via remote software upgrades integrated into  the user interface. “With the new Digital Art Mode, BMW Cultural  Engagement reaches new heights while creating something entirely  unique,” said Christoph Grote, Senior Vice President Digital Car,  BMW Group, “For the very first time, we are making digital art an  integral part of the modern driving experience in a car and use  innovative technology to transform mobility into an individual, highly  exclusive and emotional experience.”The artwork to be presented on the BMW Curved Display and created by  Cao Fei, speaks of the continuous change of a globalized and  interconnected world and is named “Quantum Garden”. Galaxies of visual  spaces filled with dots, light beams and nebulae constantly moving  towards and away from each other at varying speeds while growing and  shrinking again and again. They express the mostly invisible but  continuous links connecting people, groups and systems that affect  each other even over great distances and, in doing so, also modify  their surroundings. In her artwork – produced especially for the  Digital Art Mode – Cao Fei combines her reflections on these global  connections and correlations with the pursuit of a collaborative form  of what in Asian cultures is often described as the perfect harmony of  humankind and nature. The artist herself explains this eternal quest  as follows: “The desire to connect is omnipresent. It is about how we  can synergize with the world, live with nature and renew our energy.”“2017 was a spectacular year, a time when humanity embraced the  advent of artificial intelligence. During this time, I employed  augmented reality to create the 18th BMW Art Car, a car with an aura  of its own, enhanced by new technologies. 2021 was a difficult and  special year. While humanity was stuck and helpless, the world has  been moving determinedly into the metaverse, the age of virtual  immersion. This is the very moment when I was once again invited to  participate in BMW's groundbreaking Digital Art Mode,” said Cao Fei.  “My work ‘Quantum Garden’ gives the BMW driver the chance to  experience the ever-changing digital landscapes of a multifaceted  universe in a screen world, where abstract poetry and sensory pixels  intersect. Its network of open-ended spectra are connecting our hearts  to the call of goodwill from the depths of the universe.”In her own words, Cao Fei describes “Quantum Garden” as “a poetic  collection of universes, countless atoms, nebulae, and thousands of  fast-moving beams of light from the depths of the universe, and those  trailing strings of galaxies, growing larger and smaller, intersecting  and extending, combining and separating, perceiving and listening to  each other, around a myriad of constantly rotating centers. In a  multidimensional universe, the trajectory is non-linear, the journey  has no end, only the freedom to switch between the micro and macro  worlds, to wander, to explore, and to evolve.”New ways of experiencing culture: BMW Group once again  pioneeringThe Digital Art Mode was created in the  anniversary year of BMW Group Cultural Engagement. For 50 years, BMW  has been assuming its social responsibility in the world of culture  with its partnerships and initiatives. In doing so, hundreds of  long-term cooperations have become an integral part of the company’s  social sustainability. Many of its projects have begun exploring the  potential inherent in digitalization to expand the scope of BMW  Cultural Engagement, develop new forms of artistic expression and  reach new audiences.Digital art by Cao Fei: from the racetrack to the  BMW Curved DisplayWhen Cao Fei designed the BMW Art Car  in 2017, BMW Group once again pioneered the design of innovative  cultural experiences. For the very first time, a vehicle was  transformed into a rolling sculpture by using augmented reality. Cao  Fei’s BMW Art Car included three components: a film about a spiritual  time traveler, a carbon black BMW M6 GT3 and an augmented reality  installation consisting of multicolored light particles made visible  with the help of a custom-made app programmed for the occasion. Every  time the app was used near the race car, the screen of the smartphone  displayed floating, ever-changing light strips above and around the  BMW M6 GT3 – a reflection of the rapid change of the artist’s home  country as seen on the 18th BMW Art Car.Cao Fei sees her work on the new Digital Art Mode as a direct  continuation of her creative process in collaboration with the  BMW Group. Designing a race car with augmented reality will now be  followed by integrating digital art into the interior of series vehicles. If you have any questions, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsDoris FleischerBMW Group Cultural  EngagementTelephone: +49 89 328 27806Email: Doris.Fleischer@bmw.deMartin TholundBMW Group Digital Experience Communications  Telephone: +49 89 382 77126Email: martin.tholund@bmwgroup.comWebsite: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.de\n"}
{"prompt":" World premiere: Body surface with real color change thanks to electrophoretic technology  Potential for future interior and exterior applications  ->","completion":" Munich. Digitisation is delivering an integrated user  experience characterised by individuality and emotionalisation in the  interior of current BMW models. The My Modes allow the driver to  tailor the atmosphere in the interior entirely to their personal mood  and the driving experience they want. With the BMW iX Flow featuring E  Ink being presented on the occasion of CES 2022, the Munich-based  premium car manufacturer is offering the prospect of a future  technology that uses digitisation to also adapt the exterior of a  vehicle to different situations and individual wishes. The surface of  the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink can vary its shade at the driver's prompting.Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,    Development: \"Digital experiences won't just be  limited to displays in the future. There will be more and more melding  of the real and virtual. With the BMW iX Flow, we are bringing the car  body to life.\"The fluid colour changes are made possible by a specially developed  body wrap that is tailored precisely to the contours of the  all-electric Sports Activity Vehicle from BMW. When stimulated by  electrical signals, the electrophoretic technology brings different  colour pigments to the surface, causing the body skin to take on the  desired colouration. Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design:  \"The BMW iX Flow is an advanced research and design project and a  great example of the forward thinking that BMW is known for.\"The innovative E Ink technology opens completely new ways of changing  the vehicle's appearance in line with the driver's aesthetic  preferences, the environmental conditions or even functional  requirements. The technology thus offers unprecedented potential for  personalisation in the area of exterior design. The BMW iX Flow  featuring E Ink demonstrates this potential to impressive effect.  Against this background, the BMW Group is driving the development of  the technology so that a new form of personalisation can be  experienced both on the outside and in the inside of future production vehicles.Already today, the colour chosen for a car is an expression of the  driver's personality. The choice of exterior paints available for  current BMW models covers a wide colour spectrum. In this way, the  longing for a wildly expressive, extravagant, or sporty appearance on  the outside can be taken into account as well as the desire for an  understated, subtle or elegant appearance. New variants are added each  year that reflect the characteristics of the model in question and  that allow the brand to keep setting trends in the area of exterior design.New technologies will provide a whole new level of decision-making  freedom in the future. \"This gives the driver the freedom to  express different facets of their personality or even their enjoyment  of change outwardly, and to redefine this each time they sit into  their car,\" says Stella Clarke, Head of Project for the BMW iX  Flow featuring E Ink. \"Similar to fashion or the status ads on  social media channels, the vehicle then becomes an expression of  different moods and circumstances in daily life.\"How a variable exterior colour can increase  efficiency.A variable exterior colour can also  contribute to wellness in the interior and to the efficiency of the  vehicle. This is done by taking account of the different abilities of  light and dark colours when it comes to reflecting sunlight and the  associated absorption of thermal energy. A white surface reflects a  lot more sunlight than a black one. By implication, heating of the  vehicle and passenger compartment as a result of strong sunlight and  high outside temperatures can be reduced by changing the exterior to a  light colour. In cooler weather, a dark outer skin will help the  vehicle to absorb noticeably more warmth from the sun.In both cases, selective colour changes can help to cut the amount of  cooling and heating required from the vehicle's air conditioning. This  reduces the amount of energy the vehicle electrical system needs and  with it also the vehicle's fuel or electricity consumption. In an  all-electric car, changing the colour in line with the weather can  therefore also help to increase the range. In the interior, the  technology could, for example, prevent the dashboard from heating up  too much.E Ink technology itself is extremely energy efficient. Unlike  displays or projectors, the electrophoretic technology needs  absolutely no energy to keep the chosen colour state constant. Current  only flows during the short colour changing phase.Millions of paint capsules in a custom wrap.  Electrophoretic colouring is based on a technology  developed by E Ink that is most well-known from the displays used in  eReaders. The surface coating of the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink  contains many millions of microcapsules, with a diameter equivalent to  the thickness of a human hair. Each of these microcapsules contains  negatively charged white pigments and positively charged black  pigments. Depending on the chosen setting, stimulation by means of an  electrical field causes either the white or the black pigments to  collect at the surface of the microcapsule, giving the car body the  desired shade.Achieving this effect on a vehicle body involves the application of  many precisely fitted ePaper segments. Generative design processes are  implemented to ensure the segments reflect the characteristic contours  of the vehicle and the resulting variations in light and shadow. The  generative design algorithms enable the necessary formability and  flexibility required to tailor the ePaper exactly to the design lines  of the vehicle.Laser cutting technologies guarantee high precision in generating  each segment. After the segments are applied and the power supply for  stimulating the electrical field is connected, the entire body is  warmed and sealed to guarantee optimum and uniform colour reproduction  during every colour change.\n"}
{"prompt":" BMW previews in-car entertainment of the future on the occasion of CES 2022  BMW Theatre Screen with Amazon Fire TV built-in  Theatre mode turns vehicle fund into cinema lounge  31-inch ultra-wide display with resolution up to 8K  ->","completion":" Munich. The My Modes make individual mobility in a  BMW a particularly intense experience. They create an integrated user  experience in the interior that reflects and influences the mood of  the driver and their passengers in a specific situational context.  More than ever, an atmosphere is established with unique moments full  of emotion. At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2022, the BMW  Group previews another, particularly exclusive version of My Modes in  combination with a new and worldwide unique in-car entertainment  system for future BMW models. My Mode Theatre transforms the rear of  the interior into a private cinema lounge with surround sound and 5G  connectivity thanks to the BMW Theatre Screen, a panorama display in  32:9 format. In this setting, every journey becomes a breathtaking  cinema experience for the rear passengers with a personalised  programme of entertainment on a 31-inch ultra-wide display with a  resolution of up to 8K.Frank Weber, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG  Development: \"We develop immersive, digital experiences  for sheer driving pleasure. In Theatre Mode, the rear of the interior  is transformed into a private cinema lounge. With the 31 inch display,  5G connectivity, 8K resolution, surround sound and individual  streaming program, an unprecedented experience is created that sets  new standards for in-car entertainment.\"The large screen with smart TV function is extended out of the  headliner on request by a sophisticated rotary movement on two  articulated rails at the sides. The BMW Theatre Screen can be  controlled by touch operation or using touch pads integrated in the  rear doors.Setting a new benchmark for in-car 4K entertainment.  To help deliver this bold innovation, the BMW Group  selected Amazon Fire TV to bring together the content and technology  that makes seamless in-vehicle entertainment experiences possible. The  Fire TV experience lets rear-seat passengers enjoy a wide variety of  content from popular apps, so they can stream movies and TV episodes,  listen to music, and watch downloaded programs – all while on the  road. This is the first vehicle integration of Amazon Fire TV to  support content in 4K, and offers the highest resolution and biggest  display of any in-car Fire TV experience. There will be a  country-specific offering for customers in China.Raise the curtain: Atmospheric setting with sound from the    cooperation with Hans Zimmer. The new in-car entertainment experience in future  luxury class models from BMW begins with the activation of My Mode  Theatre. When the BMW Theatre Screen moves out of the headliner, this  is accompanied by a sound experience created exclusively for this  purpose in cooperation between the BMW Group and the renowned film  music composer and Academy Award winner, Hans Zimmer, which ends at  the precise moment when the screen reaches its final position. A  graphic animation also appears on the display, specially designed by  BMW User Interface Design for the My Mode Theatre. At the same time, the roller sunblinds for the  side windows and the rear window are closed and the ambient lighting  in the rear of the vehicle is dimmed.Great cinema: 32:9 panorama display with a resolution of up to    8K. The BMW Theatre Screen is an ultra-wide panorama  display with a screen diagonal of 31 inches that reaches horizontally  over almost the entire interior and in height from the headliner to  the backrests of the front seats. With a zoom function, the contents  of the entertainment programme can be played in width-to-height of  16:9, 21:9 or even in 32:9 format (content may be cropped while  zoomed). The exceptionally high display resolution of about 8000 ×  2000 pixels per screen column ensures an extremely clear and detailed  visual experience when enjoying cinema films in ultra HD quality. The  integrated Bowers & Wilkins Diamond Surround Sound System delivers  an extremely high-end and multifaceted sound experience.The tilt of the display can be adjusted by touch operation using the  control menu on the in-car entertainment system.

{"prompt":"All-wheel drive is an advantage in any traffic situation. But what four driven wheels are really capable of can only be experienced off the beaten track - and on snow. On an excursion with the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman, outstanding power and the ALL4 system provide ideal conditions for enjoying the white landscape in an extremely sporty way. ->","completion":" Munich. Snow is much more than a collection of frozen  water droplets. Its crystal lattice structure depends on the  temperature and humidity when the flakes form. At its best, snow is  loose, powdery and white. When it falls from the sky in the right  places, preferably mountainous ones, it forms the basis for attractive  leisure activities such as skiing, snowshoeing or sledding. Likewise,  the beautiful snow can provide an extra dose of skiing fun. The  prerequisite for this is some skill with the accelerator pedal,  steering wheel and brake, as well as the right vehicle. The MINI John  Cooper Works Countryman (fuel consumption combined: 8.3 - 7.6 l\/100  km; CO2 emissions combined: 188 - 173 g\/km according to WLTP)  impresses with its qualities not only on the road and on unpaved  terrain, but also on snow.The fascination that the extremely sporty all-rounder arouses in  winter road conditions is the result of an extraordinary combination  of pure temperament and precisely controlled power distribution. The  outstanding power of its 225 kW\/306 hp four-cylinder turbo engine with  a maximum torque of 450 Nm is transmitted to all four wheels via an  8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission as standard. This is ensured by  the ALL4 all-wheel drive system, also standard, which is also  supported by a differential lock for the front wheels integrated into  the transmission. This overall package and the model-specific  suspension technology guarantee extreme performance on all roads - no  matter how snowy and ungritted they may be. This is because the drive  torque is always well-dosed to those wheels that can transfer it to  the maximum extent to the road or track.This makes the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman ideal for a winter  excursion from Munich towards Lake Constance through the mountainous  landscape of the Allgäu. The Swabian part of the northern Alpine  region is known for its diverse rock formations and as a habitat for  numerous rare animal and plant species. As a holiday region, the  Allgäu attracts both recreation-seeking and sporty visitors in the  summer and winter months who appreciate intact nature, leisure  activities and impressive cultural experiences.In the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman, driving on narrow mountain  roads and through the snowy, glittering winter wonderland can be  easily enjoyed together with friends or the whole family. With its  four doors and large tailgate, five fully-fledged seats and a luggage  compartment volume that can be expanded from 450 to up to 1 390  litres, the extremely sporty all-rounder not only offers the comfort  level required for longer excursions, but also the corresponding  transport capacities. Optional extras include a roof rail for  attaching ski racks or transport boxes and a rear luggage rack  preparation for transporting bicycles.A first photo stop takes the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman near  Oberstdorf. The community on the edge of the Allgäu High Alps is  considered the winter sports capital of the area. There are 140  prepared kilometres of winter hiking trails where guests can  experience snow-covered mountain landscapes, idyllic huts and  enchanting nature. Just under 20 kilometres further north, the  traveller arrives in Sonthofen in the Bavarian district of Oberallgäu.  The climatic health resort with the coordinates 47°31' north latitude  and 10°20' east longitude is the town furthest south in Germany.On the winding country roads of the region, the MINI John Cooper  Works Countryman benefits from its precise steering and confidently  controllable handling even in highly dynamic driving situations. A  body structure and chassis connection with optimised rigidity  contribute to the agile driving characteristics of the top athlete. In  addition to model-specific modified components, the chassis also  features suspension and damping tuning refined with racing know-how,  as well as DSC (Dynamic Stability Control). The standard equipment of  the MINI John Cooper Works Countryman also includes a sports brake  system with four-piston fixed calliper disc brakes at the front and  single-piston fist calliper disc brakes at the rear wheels. It can  also be fitted with an Adaptive Suspension as an option.Driving dynamically over mountain passes and serpentines, the MINI  John Cooper Works Countryman quickly reaches its optimum operating  temperature even in wintry weather - and after about 50 kilometres in  an easterly direction, one of Bavaria's most popular sights.  Neuschwanstein Castle, not far from Füssen, was commissioned by the  Bavarian King Ludwig II, who first moved in there 15 years after  construction began in 1869, but died just two years later. Since then,  his fairytale castle has repeatedly been used as a film set. It can be  impressively photographed from a variety of perspectives, which is why  it can sometimes get a little crowded on the streets around the castle hill.Following this extremely popular stopover, it's time to get back to  solitude - for example in the Ammergau Alps, Bavaria's largest nature  reserve. The extensive region stretches between the rivers Lech and  Loisach. To the south, the Zwischentoren valley in the Außerfern  region separates the Ammergau Alps from the Lechtal Alps. To the  north, they merge smoothly into the Alpine foothills. In search of  fresh snow, the route leads from here over the border into Austria,  past the Plansee lake and on to Ettal, where the monastery of the same  name, a world-class cultural monument, can be visited. Even on  mountain roads that have not yet been cleared of snow, the MINI John  Cooper Works Countryman unfalteringly makes its way as dusk quickly  sets in. The adaptive LED headlights with variable light distribution  and matrix function for the high beam, available as an optional extra,  optimise visibility and thus safety both in the dark and in heavy snow.Those who spend the night in the Ammergau Alps can not only look  forward to a fantastically beautiful winter landscape the following  day, but also to a real programme of contrasts. A walk along the  almost 85-kilometre-long meditation trail between the Wieskirche  church in Steingaden and Linderhof Castle in Graswangtal near Ettal  promises a relaxing experience of nature. Afterwards, the MINI John  Cooper Works Countryman with its irresistible driving sound, even when  idling, is already waiting to storm up the next snowy pass road.  In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product Communications MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the    BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles    and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility    services.

She presented  the 10,000th MINI to its new owner, Andreas Hankel, at BMW Welt on 30  Dec. 2021, alongside Bernd Körber, head of MINI, Bernhard Kuhnt, head  of Market Germany and Erwin Winterholler, managing director of the  Widmann & Winterholler showroom.“We are proud of the tremendous success the fully-electric MINI has  already achieved since its market launch in March 2020,” von Mirbach  continued. “This success was only possible together with our strong  partners in the retail organisation.” Germany biggest market for MINI Electric Germany is the largest market worldwide for the fully-electric MINI  from Oxford. More than one in five MINIs (23.6%) is already fully  electric. The MINI Electric is the MINI family’s highest-volume  derivative and played a key role for the brand in 2021, delivering  growth of +132%. With the plug-in hybrid MINI Cooper SE Countryman  ALL4*, overall sales of electrified models increased by over 70%,  compared to the previous year. This means every third MINI (31%) is electrified. MINI sales in 2021 – growing market share A total of 43,004 MINI vehicles** were registered in Germany in 2021.  Von Mirbach explains: “In light of the challenging supply situation,  the fact that MINI sales were only 2.7% lower than the previous year  represents a strong operating performance by the whole team. As a  result, we were able to continue to grow MINI’s market share in the  premium segment.” MINI goes all-electricMINI has already paved the way for tomorrow’s electric future. The  fully-electric MINI Cooper SE is being built at Plant Oxford. The next  generation of the MINI Countryman will also come off the production  line in Leipzig as an electric model from 2023. In the same year,  production of fully-electric MINI models based on a new  electric-vehicle architecture will also begin in China.“In the same way that the first Mini brought a new dimension to the  mobility of the day just over 60 years ago, we are now taking the next  step, by going all-electric from the early 2030s onwards,” explains  von Mirbach. As an innovative and inspiring urban brand, MINI was made for  electromobility. MINI drivers appreciate the British brand’s  combination of signature go-kart feeling and individual design with  sustainable urban mobility. MINI has been the answer to the challenges  of individual mobility since it was born in the midst of the Suez  Crisis. Von Mirbach: “MINI is now, once again, tackling current  challenges in the fields of mobility and climate protection and  responding to them with distinctive, brand-authentic solutions for  tomorrow’s driving fun.” MINI ChargingEnthusiasm for electrified driving is sustainable, as long as  everyday charging is easy and convenient: MINI Charging provides MINI  drivers in Germany with flexible solutions for home and workplace  charging, as well as access to one of Europe’s largest public charging  networks, with more than 250,000 charging points. Transformation – also for our customersSince it is a new drive technology, customers require more extensive  consulting for electromobility.

We are very pleased and honoured by this trust. We are  now looking forward to seeing how our new car fares in the hands of  many different drivers and teams at racetracks and in racing series  all over the world.” First up, on 14th\/15th January, is the 24h  Dubai, for which Schubert Motorsport has already registered BMW M  works driver Nick Yelloly (GBR), Jordan Witt (GBR), Marcel Lenerz and  Jens Liebhauser (both GER) for the #30 BMW M4 GT3. ST Racing lines up  with two cars.

{"prompt":"BMW Group successfully positions itself as one of the most exciting employers of our time in cross-industry competition  Recognised as “World's Most Attractive Employer” (automotive) and number one in the Young Professionals Barometer Germany.  ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is shaping the mobility of  tomorrow – making it electric, digital and circular. With this  consistent focus, the company can offer exciting, future-oriented  jobs. The BMW Group was once again rewarded for this with the top spot  in relevant 2021 employer rankings and is therefore on a par with  international technology leaders. Young talents especially appreciate  that, at the BMW Group, they can contribute to society and grow as a  person. “We are especially pleased that we are able to position  ourselves as an attractive and reliable employer, at both national and  international level, in times of transformation. This also pays off in  the competition for young talents,” says Ilka Horstmeier, member of  the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Human Resources and  Labour Relations.In this year’s “World’s Most Attractive Employer” survey of around  221,000 students from the ten most important economic nations  conducted by Universum, the BMW Group was ranked as the best  automotive employer worldwide among all target groups. The company is  holding its own in a highly competitive international market for the  best talents. In the engineering category, the BMW Group took one of  the top spots – earning a sensational third place, right behind Google  and Microsoft. In the survey of IT students, the BMW Group was the  only industrial company among the tech giants and the only automotive  company to make the top ten, with a solid ninth place. The BMW Group  also finished well ahead of all other automotive manufacturers in the  business students’ ranking, coming in 13th. The BMW Group consistently  makes the top ten in the IT category in other relevant surveys of  students and professionals in Germany, like the Trendence Graduate  Barometer and the Universum Students and Professionals Study. In the  engineering and business categories, the company comfortably ranks  among the top five employers.It is particularly gratifying that the BMW Group was also named most  attractive employer by young professionals in Germany in the Trendence  Professionals Barometer for the tenth consecutive year. Trendence  Institut GmbH is an independent consulting and market research firm  that surveys more than 25,000 experienced college graduates every  year. The BMW Group is also a very popular employer among skilled  workers: In the Trendence Skilled Workers Barometer 2021, which  surveyed almost 50,000 employees in Germany, the company was ranked  second and therefore improved on its position from the previous year.  In the survey of students on their assessment of the attractivity of  employers, the BMW Group has again ranked 4th and is thus an  established entity in the Trendence Student Barometer. This shows that  talents in the marketplace also recognise what BMW Group staff confirm  in the company’s own Employee Surveys: This year, 91 percent of them  said they were proud to work for the BMW Group.Young talents seeking security and stabilityCOVID-19, but also the economic and social upheavals of 2020 and  2021, have led young talents to re-evaluate their working life. The  studies are seeing a shift in young talents towards more stability and  security – and, therefore, more towards companies like the BMW Group  that have already successfully steered their employees through times  of change in the past.Talents for a forward-looking digital and sustainable mobilityThe BMW Group offers a whole host of attractive perspectives. Above  all, this includes fascinating products that are not just developed  virtually, but implemented and visible on the roads. This is  particularly appealing to IT talents, whose innovations are crucial to  the mobility of tomorrow. “Both young talents and professionals in the  fields of IT, science and engineering can find highly attractive entry  opportunities at the BMW Group. New colleagues quickly gain an insight  into our topics, interfaces, and products, and become part of the BMW  Group’s creative and dynamic global team. We provide the best  conditions for our teams to leverage their individual skills and  passion to shape the best solutions for the sustainable mobility of  the future,” says Nicole Kurek, head of Talent and Transformation  Management. To achieve this, the BMW Group is also looking for experts  in future areas of activity like battery research, automated driving,  artificial intelligence, software development and IT security, but  also IT specialists for databases and cloud systems, as well as app  developers for infotainment and entertainment.Interested talents can discover for themselves what working at the  BMW Group is all about on the BMW Group Careers social media channels.  They can also find information on openings for direct entry and  internships, and apply directly, on the BMW Group career pages.Further information: If you have any questions, please contact:BMW Group Corporate CommunicationsAngela Konert, spokesperson Human ResourcesTelephone: +49-89-382-50591Email: angela.konert@bmw.deBernd Eckstein, head of Communications Human Resources, Working  Environment, Real Estate, Corporate CitizenshipTelephone: +49-89-382-59490Email: bernd.eckstein@bmw.deMedia website: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail: presse@bmw.de The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

A little more than one and a half years have passed    since Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) was seriously injured in a handbike    accident in June 2020 in Italy. In his long recovery process, the    BMW Group Ambassador shows his well-known fighting spirit. The    55-year old has meanwhile left hospital and continues his    rehabilitation partly at home. In an interview, his wife Daniela    Zanardi speaks about the current situation. Five months after her first interview in July 2021, Daniela Zanardi again would like    to use this opportunity to address the public and answer questions    about the status of Alex’ recovery. Daniela, the sympathy you receive from all over the world is    certainly still very high? Daniela Zanardi: “Yes, we still get a lot of messages and especially  on Alex’s 55th birthday in October it was overwhelming how  many people have sent him their best wishes, also via social media. We  are very grateful to see how many people all over the world have Alex  in their thoughts. This great sympathy shows how much Alex’s recovery  touches the people. For this reason, we have decided to offer the  public an insight into his current recovery process for the second  time with this interview. At the same time, we appreciate everybody’s  understanding that, apart from this, we cannot respond to the many  requests about this health and we also ask everybody to respect our  privacy. Because our highest priority is to accompany Alex on his way  with our full energy.” What can you say about the recovery process? How is Alex these days? Zanardi: “The recovery continues to be a long process. The  rehabilitation programme led by doctors, physiotherapists,  neuropsychologists and speech therapists has enabled steady progress.  Of course, setbacks are there and can still occur. Sometimes you also  have to make two steps back in order to make one step forward. But  Alex proves again and again that he is a real fighter.” … who has reached an important milestone! Zanardi: “Yes, indeed. An important step was that Alex was able to  leave hospital a few weeks ago and is back at home with us now. We had  to wait very long for this and are very happy that it was possible  now, even if there are still temporary stays in special clinics  planned for the future to carry out special rehabilitation measures on site.” How did Alex settle at home? Zanardi: “Very well. After the long time in hospital it is important  for him to be back with his family and in his familiar environment.  You also have to consider that, due to the Corona situation, Alex had  only people with face masks and in protective equipment around him for  one and a half years. In addition, due to the comprehensive and  important protective measures in the clinic, the visiting  possibilities are, of course, very restricted.” What does that mean exactly? Zanardi: “Alex hasn’t met friends and part of the family for one and  a half years. Only me, our son and Alex’s mother could visit him, but  always only one person per day and this only for one and a half hours.  All this did not help to make the situation easier for Alex. Therefore  it helps that he is now at home with us, even if also at home he  currently can only be with the closest family as Corona numbers are  increasing again. But we are with Alex all day, he is in his familiar  environment and thus could return a little bit to normality. This  gives him additional power. We are very grateful to the medical staff  in the clinics he has been treated in. The doctors, care personnel,  therapists and everybody being involved have done so much for Alex and  continue to accompany us in his recovery process. In the clinics, Alex  is in very good hands, but his own home still is his own home.” What can you tell us about his daily programme and routine? Zanardi: “It varies. Different programmes Alex did in hospital, are  continued at home now. During the week, a therapist works with him and  they do physical, neurological and logopedical exercises. In regards  of his physical condition, there is a lot of progress. Alex has more  and more strength in the arms, that has increased a lot. And, other  than in hospital where he was in bed a lot, Alex now spends most of  the day in the wheel chair with us. He just rests a bit in the  afternoon after lunch.” What are the further expectations for his recovery process? Zanardi: “You still can’t predict how his recovery will further  develop. It is still a long and challenging way that Alex tackles with  a lot of fighting spirit. It is a big help for him and us that we  receive so much support on this way, not only from the doctors and  therapists that intensively work with him. Our friends are always  there for us. This includes the BMW Group family which we can always  count on and that is firmly at our side also in this difficult time.  We are very grateful to everyone for that and for so much more because  these strong ties give us additional energy. This also goes for the  continued sympathy we receive from racing drivers, fans and  acquaintances from all over the world. We would like to express a big  Grazie to all who send their good thoughts and power to Alex. We wish  everybody a merry Christmas and all the best for the new year.”\n"}

They did it again. After Academy Award winner  Christoph Waltz played a central role in the world design premiere of  the BMW iX at #NEXTGen 2020, he now stars in the new BMW Christmas  film. In the film he encounters two old acquaintances: Oliver Zipse,  Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, and the BMW iX. They  are supported by Alex Hirschi, known as Supercar Blondie, star  designer Alexa Chung and Kai Langer, Head of Design BMW i who also  appear in the clip.Christoph Waltz's partnership with the BMW Group was initiated by  Oliver Zipse. The company cooperates with avant-garde pioneers from  ecology, social sciences, fashion, sports, music, film and other  cultural disciplines. The goal is to create a deeper understanding of  the needs, desires and trends of the future. Zipse invited the actor  to enter into critical dialogue with designers, technology developers  and strategy experts from the BMW Group. His openness, pragmatism and  his slight impatience have given the BMW Group important impetus. Now  this cooperation continues.The result is a clip of cinematic quality, a cat-and-mouse game  embedded in a wonderful Christmas film setting. It’s exciting and  thrilling and there’s a fine sense of irony and comedy. The BMW  Christmas film begins in Munich. It’s late afternoon at BMW  headquarters, a classic BMW 3.0 CS approaches. The driver gets out and  we see who it is: Christoph Waltz.He is on his way to a meeting with Oliver Zipse and to the BMW iX,  the BMW Group's new technology flagship that represents the future of  the company: Fully electric, sustainable, featuring pioneering design  and luxurious interior comfort. These things are important to  Christoph Waltz. The actor is intensively involved with the ecological  aspects of sustainable drive technology. He values premium quality,  technological precision and attention to detail. He doesn't make much  of Christmas.On the run from ChristmasThere is a mix-up at the reception. After Waltz has registered his  meeting with Oliver Zipse, he is told he is invited to the BMW  Christmas party. A staff member in a Christmas hat is to take him  there. Waltz freezes. It is the prelude to an amusing escape in which  Christoph Waltz is only concerned with one thing: To avoid everything  that has to do with Christmas. Which doesn’t turn out to be so easy.Christoph Waltz hopes for support from two celebrity guestsWaltz is making his way through BMW Welt, when he hears voices. Two  more celebrity guests appear in the Christmas film: Kai Langer, Head  of Design BMW i, and fashion designer Alexa Chung.

Alex Hirschi aka Supercar Blondie stands next to a concealed BMW  model. She is just about to unveil the vehicle when Waltz bursts onto  the set. Supercar Blondie complains loudly, but by then Waltz has  already disappeared from the scene.Christoph Waltz runs off, he rushes into another room thinking he is  finally safe. He spins around - and finds himself standing in the  middle of the BMW Christmas party. Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board  of Management of BMW AG, approaches him, they clink glasses. The actor relaxes.Happy ending with an Aventurine Red BMW iXThe BMW Christmas film wouldn't be a real Christmas film without a  happy ending. How the story ends is revealed at the end of the clip.

The two BMW teams – BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Bonovo action BMW Racing Team – took to the track in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, this week. ->","completion":" Jerez de la Frontera. In preparation for the 2022 season of    the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW Motorrad    Motorsport carried out its first winter test. The two BMW teams –    BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Bonovo action BMW Racing Team – took    to the track in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain, this week.  In the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Michael van der Mark (NED)  continued his work on the BMW M 1000 RR as he looks to take another  step forward next season after one win and a further two podiums in  2021. Scott Redding (GBR) used the test days to familiarise himself  with his future bike and team. The Brit had gained his first  experience on his new bike during a private test in Estoril (POR) last  week. The focus there was on getting to know the bike and recording  the ergometry. The findings from the test were implemented quickly and  the modified parts and new components were already available by the  time he arrived at the Jerez de la Frontera test. With the two riders, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team tested engine  specifications for 2022, as well as chassis modifications. The direct  competitive comparison allows the team to determine the work direction  in preparation for the next test in the new year. The Bonovo action BMW Racing Team is also at Jerez de la Frontera  with its two new riders. After Eugene Laverty (IRL) and Loris Baz  (FRA) visited the team headquarters in Germany in November, they began  the test work together at the racetrack. Laverty, who was heavily  involved in the development of the BMW M 1000 RR, will be racing with  the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in his third season as a BMW works  driver. Baz is already familiar with the BMW S 1000 RR, on which he  rode in the WorldSBK in 2018, and uses the test to learn more about  the M RR. Quotes after the Jerez de la Frontera test. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “There have been a lot of new things at this test. In general, it has  been important to test with all four riders, including the two new  additions Baz and Redding, before Christmas. It was good to have all  four riders on the same bike on the same race track. We brought a lot  of new test items that we either confirmed or evaluated with all four  of the in order to get the right direction. With two new riders you of  course first to get used to the way they give their feedback and how  to transfer their comments but we managed that very well. We then also  compared this feedback with that given by van der Mark and Laverty who  already knew the bike very well. We have ticked all boxes in our test  programme but maybe might do some further laps tomorrow. We gathered a  huge amount of information and this is now to be analysed. Overall, we  found very good directions and in general, I am very satisfied. We  take a lot of positives back home. Now we will have a well-deserved  Christmas break but then we will continue to intensively prepare for  the season. We are very optimistic looking forward.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It has been a successful test for both sides of the pit box.  We have a new rider with Scott. He had a lot of things to work through  but most importantly for him was to find that comfortable setting  feeling with the bike. I am really pleased about his work ethic in the  pit box. He has put a lot of laps in and he acclimatised very well. On  Michael’s side, we worked on similar development parts to what Scott  has and he has been working through that very well as well. Comparing  both riders’ feedback it is very similar and  I am very pleased about  that. I think it is proving that the set-up direction we are going  with the BMW M 1000 RR is aligned between both riders which is very  important. Equally important is that we got new team-members within  the group and I am really pleased to see how all these guys are  working together. There has been a lot of overlapping, a lot of  chassis changes, a lot of engine changes and everybody has been  working as a group, so I applaud all the team and all the guys working  very closely together. Overall I think we can leave the test here at  Jerez with our heads held up high, we have done a good job and we can  go into the Christmas break with a lot of confidence and get ready for  our next test in the new year.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was good to have a test even if it was so late in the year. We had a  lot of new components and items to try on the bike. At this test we  barely played around with the set-up of the bike, we mainly tried new  parts to figure out what brings improvement and what does not. We need  to get some ideas and start producing the new things. It has been a  really good test and I am really happy with a lot of new things. It  was great to gather good information and now I am looking forward to a  short Christmas break.” Michael Galinski, Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team:  “It has been the first test for the new season and the first  time for us to be at the race track with the big team. I want to take  this opportunity to say a big thank you to Jürgen Röder, who made it  possible for us to now compete as a two-rider team. He will attend  many races next year and we are looking forward to that. We have a lot  of new people with us, also the riders are partly new for us. Of  course we have known both for many years. Loris has already raced for  our team and I have also known Eugene for quite some time. Both did a  great job at the test. But not only that, it was also important for me  to gel with the new members as a team and to get used to each other.  That worked very well. With new people, for example from England and  France, our team has become more international after being a more or  less German squad in the past. Like at every other team, English is  now our team language. The collaboration in the combination with SMR  and Bonovo action also works very well. There are always a lot of  things to try and when time allows we share this between us. The test  has been very positive in all aspects, we are also happy with the lap  times. But we still have some things to find and work to do.” Eugene Laverty, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I  already met the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in November when we went  to Germany and spent a weekend together with the guys. They invited us  all there and it was so nice to meet each other away from the track  because sometimes you only meet the guys in a work environment. So to  go there, have some beers and relax away from the track and made me  feel at home straight away. The first test days with the team have  been very positive. I felt comfortable on the bike immediately after  the first couple of exits on day one. I feel good in braking which is  an area I am always working on. I am happy with the progress we are  making. There is still work to do to improve our turning in the long  corners compared to the other BMW riders but I am happy that we are  right there in the mix. There is a really good atmosphere in the box,  I get on very well with Loris. He is a fast guy and that’s important,  to have a fast team-mate to push you. We work together well and all  the guys are experienced as well. It’s great crew and I think we have  a good year ahead of us.” Loris Baz, Bonovo action BMW Racing Team: “I am happy  to be back with BMW and about the opportunity to be back in WorldSBK.  I was really looking forward to that test to have a first impression.  A December test is never the most crucial one of the season but it’s  really important for getting to know the team, to meet the people and  for the feeling you are going into the winter with. The test was a lot  of work, we did a lot of laps. Also, I was back on the bike after  nearly three months and it is never easy when you jump on a bike that  is completely different. The test was about understanding how the bike  works and also to try to give the best input based on the differences  of all the bikes I know. I have riden a lot of bikes in WorldSBK so I  was trying to adapt to the bike and at the same time give the right  input on what we can improve on that bike. The M RR has a lot of  strong points, we just need to put them together to get a bike that  works well from a riding side. When you start working with a new bike,  you have to switch from one riding style to another but we did a good  job, completing over 150 laps. Yes, I am happy. We tried some new  parts for next year and mainly a lot of things on the electronics, and  with every run we went faster and I felt a bit more confident on the  bike. I am satisfied with the job so far.” \n"}

Young was rewarded    for his success with a spectacular main prize, a new BMW M 1000 RR.    Young received his new bike at BMW Motorrad Canada in Toronto (CAN).  Since 2014, BMW Motorrad Motorsport has brought private  BMW racers from different international and national championships  around the world under one roof in a unique competition – the Race  Trophy. In 2021, a new scoring system was introduced with the ‘winning  percentage’. The Race Trophy points correspond to the percentage of  the points that the competitors have scored in their respective  championship in relation to the maximum number of points possible in  the racing series. Young emerged triumphant from a close  battle to win the 2021 Race Trophy. He finished on the podium in all  seven races of the 2021 CSBK season – one victory, five second-places  and one third – and scored a total of 84.86 Race Trophy points. In  doing so, Young narrowly defeated Roberto Tamburini (ITA) from the  Italian National Trophy 1000, who ended the year on 84.00 points.  Third place went to Alexandre Leleu (FRA) from the French European  Bikes Championship with 76.86 points. “Congratulations to  Ben Young, on behalf of the entire BMW Motorrad Motorsport family,”  said BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers. “It has been  another very exciting season, in which our private racers around the  world have again achieved countless successes. As such, the ‘winning  percentages’ they achieved in their respective racing series are very  high. All the top riders won races and claimed podiums in their  championships on the BMW M 1000 RR and the BMW S 1000 RR, so the race  for the Race Trophy was a very close one. We are also very proud to  have a number of champions in our ranks again this season. I would  like to congratulate all our motor racing customers on the success  they have achieved this season. They are the best ambassadors we at  BMW Motorrad Motorsport could wish for.” “Congratulations  to Ben Young and all the participants on their success in the 2021  season,” said Uwe Geyer, who is responsible for the Race Trophy at BMW  Motorrad Motorsport. “We are delighted that private BMW racers remain  keen to be a part of the Race Trophy family – although the pandemic  continues to affect the sport of motor racing.

We  are grateful to all the racers and teams for being part of the BMW  Motorrad Racing community.” A BMW M 1000 RR for winner Ben Young.Unfortunately, the pandemic meant it was not possible to stage a  grand finale to assemble and honour the top riders in 2021. Instead,  Young received his main prize – the BMW M 1000 RR – at BMW Motorrad  Canada. “Achieving this is very important to myself and my  team,” said winner Young. “After a Covid affected 2020 it is very  satisfying to come back racing and reach these goals I set for myself.   I feel like this is a great opportunity for myself and Canadian  racing to be recognized on a worldwide stage, and I am proud to be  able to do that. It was a great season of racing. It was nice to be  back after a year out. Working for the first time with the new  generation BMW S 1000 RR was amazing right from the get go, gaining  knowledge every lap we turned along the way. We do plan on racing the  BMW M 1000 RR next year which for me is like a dream come true. Ever  since the bike was released, it was something to drool over and now  being able to race it is going to be spectacular!” Victories and podiums aplenty.Second-placed Tamburini ended the year just 0.86 points behind  Young. Tamburini also finished on the podium in all seven races in the  Italian National Trophy 1000. With three victories, two second-places  and a third, he was crowned champion with races to spare. This was the  first title for the new BMW M 1000 RR. Third-placed Leleu was the man  to beat in the French European Bikes Championship. In 14 races, he  took eight victories on the BMW S 1000 RR, as well as one runner-up  finish and two third-places. He also won the title in his  series. Tamburini and Leleu, like all the riders who  finished from second to tenth place, receive vouchers for BMW Motorrad  parts packages, which can be redeemed at BMW Motorrad Motorsport  Official Partner, alpha Racing. The total value of the vouchers  amounts to € 40,000 (see below for an overview of the top ten). 2021 champions.In its debut season the new BMW M 1000 RR enjoyed titles and  success from the word go in various championships around the world –  and did so in a manner worthy of champions. Tamburini claimed the  first title for the new Superbike at the end of April, when he was  crowned champion in the Italian National Trophy 1000 after six of the  season’s seven races. The maiden title in an international  championship came courtesy of Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) in the  Internationalen German Motorcycle Championship (IDM). Mikhalchik had  previously been champion twice with the S 1000 RR, and repeated that  success on the M 1000 RR. The podium in the 2021 IDM was an all-BMW  affair. Champion Mikhalchik was joined on the rostrum by two fellow  BMW riders Florian Alt (GER) and Luca Grünwald (GER). In the Spanish  Superbike Championship, Ivo Lopes (POR) won the title with the BMW M  1000 RR. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese rider to be  crowned champion in the Spanish Superbike series. Other  BMW riders also won titles in their series on the BMW S 1000 RR. The  experienced Didier Grams (GER) again ended an exciting season as  champion of the International Road Racing Championship. In the French  European Bikes Championship, first and second place went to BMW  riders; runner-up behind champion Leleu was Marc Bachelier (FRA).  Michal Filla (CZE) won the Superstock class in the Alpe Adria  International Motorcycle Championship. BMW riders also finished second  and third in many more championships.  BMW Motorrad Race Trophy 2021 – Final Top Ten*.  *You can find the full standings online at: https:\/\/www.motorsport.bmw-motorrad.com\n"}

{"prompt":"The series development process for the world's only purely electrically powered luxury sedan is entering its final phase as it being tested on gruelling test tracks around the world,  Electric motors, all-wheel drive and high-voltage battery must prove how reliable and high-performing they are under maximum load. ->","completion":" Munich. The series development process of the BMW i7  (power consumption combined: 22.5 – 19.5 kWh\/100 km according to WLTP;  CO2 emissions: 0 g\/km; forecast based on the vehicle's development  status to date) in entering its final phase with the car undergoing a  demanding test programme in extreme road and weather conditions.  During so-called hot-region testing on tracks and public roads all  over the world, the development engineers primarily verify the  performance and reliability of the electric motors, the all-wheel  drive and the high-voltage battery when being exposed to maximum  stress from high temperatures, unpaved roads, dust and large  differences in altitude. The road to series production takes the  prototypes of the BMW i7 over gravel tracks into deserts, into the  mountains and on a whole series of highly dynamic routes. The BMW i7,  the world's only purely electrically powered luxury sedan, will be  presented in the course of 2022 together with other model variants of  the new BMW 7 Series.The endurance test in the hot regions of various countries and  continents serves in particular to test and safeguard all components  of the electric drive system. The components of the fifth-generation  BMW eDrive technology developed for the BMW i7 demonstrate their  unrestricted functionality even under the most adverse conditions when  being used continuously in extremely high outside temperatures,  permanent sunlight and dry conditions.Within a firmly defined test programme for the prototypes, loads are  simulated that correspond to the challenges faced by a  series-production vehicle during a complete product life cycle.  Supported by sensitive on-board measurement technology, experienced  test engineers register every reaction of the electric motors, the  high-voltage battery, drive control and the integrated cooling system  as well as the charging technology and energy management to weather  and road-related influences.The testing programme, which covers tens of thousands of kilometres,  includes long-distance and high-speed driving as well as stop-and-go  traffic in scorching heat. In addition, test sections with  particularly large differences in altitude were selected at the  hot-region test sites. In this way the temperature behaviour of the  electric motors and the torque control of the all-electric BMW xDrive  can be analysed during a particularly dynamic and long-lasting uphill  drive. To further increase the load on the drive system, the test  programme also includes mountain driving in trailer mode. At the same  time, the high-voltage battery shows how it able to continuously  deliver peak power to supply the e-motors. As an extreme scenario and  a particular challenge for energy management and power electronics,  the test also involves driving downhill with a high-voltage storage  system that is already fully charged at the start and can therefore no  longer absorb any recuperation energy.The gruelling hot-region test procedure is also used to put the  performance of the air-conditioning and other on-board electronics, as  well as the temperature resistance of the materials used in the  interior, to a particularly tough test. This is all to ensure that the  world's only purely electrically powered luxury sedan delivers a  perfectly harmonised and exclusive driving experience in any situation.\n"}

{"prompt":"Countless colourful lights, a sparkling atmosphere, imaginative decorations in the department stores and creatively decorated residential districts make a pre-Christmas visit to the \"Big Apple\" an unforgettable experience. The tour through the illuminated canyons of the city in the all-electric MINI Cooper SE is particularly festive when, with a bit of luck, its already quiet ride is also dampened by snow.  ->","completion":" Munich. Everyone who visits New York City for the  first time has one big problem: Where to start in the metropolis of  eight million? The city covers more than 1 200 square kilometres, is  one of the most important trading centres in the world and offers a  colourful selection of around 500 galleries, more than 200 museums,  about 150 theatres as well as no less than 18 000 restaurants. The  answer is easier if you choose to visit during the Christmas season:  Manhattan. Because probably nowhere else in the world is the time  before the holidays celebrated as much as there, where millions of  lights enchant the city already at the beginning of December. The more  than luxuriant sea of lights is a tradition, just like the streets  packed with street cruisers, yellow taxis, stretch limousines and  pick-ups. The sightseeing tour in the all-electric MINI Cooper SE  (power consumption combined: 17.6 - 15.2 kWh\/100 km according to WLTP,  16.9 - 14.9 kWh\/100 km according to NEDC, CO2 emissions combined: 0  g\/km) creates a relaxing contrast. Virtually silent and locally  emission-free, the MINI Electric offers a glimpse of the urban  mobility of the future all on its own in New York.Even in Manhattan, the MINI Cooper SE moves cleverly between sporty  temperament and stylish restraint. Its 135 kW\/184 hp electric motor  accelerates it to 60 km\/h in just 3.9 seconds at traffic lights.  Sustained driving pleasure is thus guaranteed. And wherever things are  a little quieter, pedestrians and cyclists are alerted to its approach  by a drive sound specially developed for the MINI Electric and  broadcast via exterior loudspeakers at low speed.An ideal starting point for the somewhat different city tour is  Central Park - and there the famous ice rink in the southern part of  the green space. Wollman Rink has been the backdrop for many Hollywood  films such as Love Story and is as popular with New Yorkers as it is  with tourists. It is an experience to be on the ice amidst the  skyscrapers with a view of the Christmas skyline of Manhattan and then  to explore the wintry park on foot.A visit to New York in December naturally includes extensive  Christmas shopping. The city is decorated everywhere, the shop windows  glitter, tell stories and make the eyes light up. The Macy's  department stores' (151 West 34th Street) is particularly splendid.  There, not only the beautifully decorated shop windows, but above all  Santa Claus himself awaits visitors young and old. In the famous Santa  Land on Macy's eighth floor, everyone can make their Christmas wishes.Via the famous 5th Avenue and West 59th Street, we then go directly  to Columbus Circle. The Christmas market there is one of the most  atmospheric in New York. The shops in the southwest corner of the park  are colourfully lit. Twelve stars more than four metres high hang from  the 30-metre-high ceiling of the Time Warner Center. The light show  \"Under the Stars\" is a real New York tradition. The  Christmas market on Union Square, on the other hand, is almost  European, where numerous New York artists and craftsmen show their  talent and creativity amidst stalls with food, drinks and sweets.On the way to more shopping hotspots, the MINI Electric rolls along  The Plaza at the intersection of 5th Avenue and East 59th Street. The  hotel with the imposing French-style façade has served as a hostel for  wealthy and famous guests for more than 100 years. Nearly 30 years  ago, it was one of the locations of the successful cinema comedy  \"Kevin - Alone in New York\". Donald Trump, then owner of The  Plaza, plays a small supporting role in it. Whether you're a parent, grandparent or godmother, if you have a wish  list written by a child in your pocket on your New York tour, you'll  inevitably be drawn to the FAO Schwarz toy shop. Once the largest toy  shop in the world, it was located on 5th Avenue until 2015 and  reopened in Rockefeller Plaza in 2018. Much of the old charm remains,  including the \"Big Piano\" on the floor, made famous by Tom  Hanks' dance in the film \"Big\". The assortment is huge, and  some people buy more than will eventually fit under the Christmas  tree. There is plenty of room for this in the luggage compartment of  the MINI Cooper SE. It can be expanded from 211 to 731 litres. Thanks  to the high-voltage battery located deep in the vehicle floor, the  MINI Electric offers exactly the same stowage volume as the  conventionally powered MINI 3-door.Close to the New York's Toy Paradise, at 1260 6th Avenue, there is  Radio City Music Hall. This is where the world-famous Radio City  Christmas Spectacular is performed, one of the most iconic Christmas  shows in New York. It includes everything that belongs to the great  celebration: from Father Christmas to the Nutcracker to the birth of  Christ. And right next door at Rockefeller Center is probably the most  famous Christmas tree in the world. This year it is a 25-metre tall  spruce from the state of Maryland. On its top sits a large star,  designed by star designer Daniel Libeskind. More than 50,000 coloured  lights illuminate the tree.At this sight, hardly anyone might think of the associated  electricity bill. But after all, not everything that is fun can be as  efficient as a MINI Electric. Its motor works very frugally, and in  addition, electricity can be fed back into the high-voltage battery  again and again during the drive in push and braking phases. The  driver can individually determine the intensity of the braking energy  recuperation via a toggle switch. The higher of the two recuperation  modes ensures a particularly strong expression of the characteristic  one-pedal feeling. When the accelerator pedal is released, electricity  is fed back into the high-voltage battery and the vehicle is braked at  the same time.What's more, the LED headlights and LED rear lights in the  characteristic Union Jack design also require very little energy. The  same applies to the MINI Cooper SE's automatic climate control. Its  interior is heated with the aid of a heat pump that absorbs waste heat  from the engine, the drive control unit and the high-voltage battery  as well as from the outside air and uses it to generate cosy  temperatures. It is characterised by particularly favourable  efficiency and uses up to 75 percent less energy than a conventional  electric heating system while providing a high level of climate  comfort in winter operation.A fitting end to the pre-Christmas sightseeing tour is a visit to the  newest observation deck in New York: The Summit One Vanderbilt (45 E  42nd Street). It is located very close to Bryant Park and Grand  Central Station and has been open to guests since October 2021. From a  height of 427 metres, there is a wonderful view of the nearby Empire  State Building, the East River and Central Park. Speaking of the  Empire State Building, the music-to-light show there is worth seeing.  The already impressive illumination of the Empire State Building is  synchronised every night to songs by stars - and at Christmas you can  expect some particularly festive music.   In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product Communications MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com  The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the    BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles    and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility    services.

{"prompt":"- BMW Group and AWS announce winners at Q2B 2021 - Follow-up projects for the winning teams - Successful crowd innovation initiative with encouraging results  ->","completion":" Munich. Today marks the end of the BMW Group Quantum  Computing Challenge with the winners being announced at Q2B 2021, the  leading conference for the application of quantum computing.The BMW Group, in collaboration with Amazon Web Services Inc. (AWS),  invoked the Crowd Innovation Initiative: in  July of this year, they called on the global quantum computing  community to develop innovative quantum algorithms for four specific  industrial challenges and to test them on real quantum computing  technologies. One winning team has now been selected for each of the  four identified areas. In all, around 70 teams from all over the world  took part. These winning teams have been selected for the four    challenges: 1. Sensor positions for automated driving functions: AccentureAccenture’s winning team tackled the problem of optimising the  positioning of sensors for highly automated driving functions. 2. Simulation of material deformations: Qu&Co The jury concluded that the quantum computing start-up Qu&Co  stood out with its approach to solving partial differential equations  in the field of numerical simulation. 3. Configuration optimisation of pre-series vehicles: 1QBit    and NTT The winning team from 1QBit and NTT came out on top with hybrid  algorithms for solving satisfiability problems in propositional logic  for optimising equipment configuration. 4. Automated quality analyses: QC Ware The QC Ware team stood out with its approach, drawn from the field of  machine learning, that can be used in image recognition in the area of  quality analysis. The BMW Group worked closely with the Amazon Quantum    Solutions Lab Professional Services team, an expert group of  professionals, throughout the challenge, right up to the moment when  the winners were determined. AWS also provided credits for the use of  Amazon Braket, enabling the development and testing of the submitted  quantum algorithms. Amazon Braket provides a development environment  to explore and create quantum algorithms, test them on quantum circuit  simulators and run them on different quantum hardware technologies. The jury that oversaw the challenge and ultimately decided on the  winning teams also included professors from the Technical University  of Munich (TUM) as well as representatives of the BMW Group and AWS.  TUM is an important partner for the BMW Group for research in the  field of quantum computing. The BMW Group announced the establishment  of the “Quantum    Algorithms and Applications” endowed chair at TUM back in June  of this year. Algorithms close to specific use cases along the  industrial value chain are being researched at the chair. The BMW  Group is providing 5.1 million euros over a period of six years to  fund the professorship, staff and equipment at TUM. Quantum computing is one of the most promising future technologies in  the automotive sector. It has enormous potential for research into  materials, for complex optimisation problems and for the future of  automated driving. The Quantum Computing Challenge once again  underlines the BMW Group’s leading-edge role in building a quantum  ecosystem. As recently as June, the company was a founding member,  along with nine other large corporations, of the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium  (QUTAC). This aims to specifically accelerate the development of  the technology in Germany and Europe. In November this year, the BMW  Group and RWTH Aachen University jointly announced the establishment  of the “Quantum    Information Systems” endowed chair, where software and  industrialisation comeptencies will be created to realise a quantum  advantage in the medium term. Dr Peter Lehnert, Vice President BMW Group Research and New    Technologies Digital Car: “We at the BMW Group are  convinced that future technologies such as quantum computing have the  potential to make our products more desirable and sustainable. We have  succeeded in reaching the global quantum computing community with our  crowd-innovation approach and enthusing them about automotive use  cases. We look forward to continuing to work with the winners.” BMW Group reaches out to quantum computing community worldwide The BMW Group received around 70 submissions from all over the world  from different areas such as international and national research  groups, the start-up scene and established companies. The  exceptionally high quality of the submissions enables new perspectives  and offers potential for innovative approaches to solutions such as  the development and further development of new algorithms. The expert  jury took into account criteria such as comprehensibility,  feasibility, scalability, innovation and benefit for the BMW Group  when evaluating the submitted solutions. All 15 finalists set themselves apart with their high innovation  potential and have therefore been shortlisted for future projects. The  journey continues straight away for the four winners: they immediately  gain the BMW Group as a customer and will be involved in the further  development of the pilot projects. The company looks forward to  working with these four winners. The BMW Group Quantum Computing Challenge is structured around the  “Supplierthon” methodology, which is the BMW Group’s future-oriented  supplier scouting method. It marks the company’s first global  crowd-innovation initiative on this scale. The crowd innovation  approach enables innovative solutions to be found within a very short  time and to validate them in cooperation with the specialist  departments. The challenge also gave the BMW Group invaluable insights  into the status quo of the global quantum ecosystem. This knowledge is  crucial in determining the future direction of research on the future  technology and the long-term establishment of the market for quantum  computing. The successful challenge along with the extremely promising  submissions encourage the company to continue to look to the crowd  innovation approach in the future. \n"}

Development of the car is already at an advanced stage. The goal is to continue the impressive success story of its predecessor.  ->","completion":" Munich. More than a year before it will be delivered to BMW M    Motorsport teams, the new BMW M4 GT4 completed its first tests last    week in Almeria (ESP). Development of the car is already at an    advanced stage. The goal is to continue the impressive success story    of its predecessor. To enable this, the new BMW M4 GT4 will not only    feature the strengths of the current car, there will be improvements    in some areas. As well as performance, BMW M Motorsport engineers    are also placing great importance on ease of maintenance and cost    efficiency. The BMW M production model provides an outstanding    basis, while the new car will also adopt certain components from its    big brother, the BMW M4 GT3. “With the new BMW M4 GT4, we are writing the next chapter in a major  success story,” said Thomas Felbermair, Vice President Sales and  Marketing BMW M GmbH. “The current model has shaken up the booming GT4  class in recent years, and has celebrated many titles and victories  all over the world. When developing the new BMW M4 GT4, we wanted to  retain the strengths of its predecessor and even improve them in some  areas. We are confident that BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers will  have a huge amount of fun with this model. The hunt for more trophies  in the GT4 segment starts in 2023.” Development of the GT4 model, which is based on the new BMW M4  production car (combined fuel consumption: 10.1 – 9.9 l\/100 km acc.  WLTP; combined CO2 emissions: 230 – 226 g\/km acc. WLTP),  began with initial computer simulations in September 2020. The BMW M4  GT4 has been developed since the start of 2021 and the first test  vehicle assembled since the summer. The chassis, including an  FIA-approved safety cage, comes from the BMW Group Plant in Dingolfing  (GER), where the production car is also built. The BMW M4 GT4  completed its first functional test in October 2021. As a car designed to be used by private BMW M Motorsport teams, the  focus is on such issues as ease of maintenance and operational costs.  Just like its predecessor, the BMW M4 GT4 is setting new benchmarks in  this regard. The complete drivetrain, including engine, transmission  and electronics, has been adopted from the production model. This  outstanding basis, which includes a multi-level traction control, has  been optimised in detail for use in motorsport. The developers placed  particular emphasis on cooling, which is always a major challenge in  the GT4 class. Some components, like the CFC roof and rear wing  concept, have been adopted from the BMW M4 GT3. The use of sustainable  materials like natural fibres, which replace carbon and plastic  components, plays an important role. BMW M Motorsport is cooperating  with the company Bcomp in this area. Further strong partners  supporting the BMW M4 GT4 project are H&R, Ravenol and RECARO. “Although we are still in a very early phase of testing, there are  already areas, in which we have achieved progress compared to the  current BMW M4 GT4,” said BMW M works driver Jens Klingmann (GER), who  took on the test work alongside Erik Johansson (SWE) in Almeria. “This  applies in particular to the seat ergonomics, ease of operation and  many additional functions that the predecessor did not have. As far as  driveability is concerned, the new BMW M4 GT4 feels very secure from  the word go. It has a large top range, in which you can push the car  to the limit. We still have a full year to optimise the car to be used  by private teams and drivers, but it is already a lot of fun to drive.” The test work continues over the coming months. A second test car  will be available for this purpose at the start of 2022.\n"}
{"prompt":"New technology flagship from the BMW Group impresses with outstanding occupant protection for adults and children.  New interactive airbag between driver and front passenger seats reduces the risk of injury in the event of a side collision.  Advanced driver assistance systems help to prevent collisions with pedestrians and cyclists ->","completion":" BMW iX achieves highest possible    five-star rating in Euro NCAP safety assessment. New technology flagship from the BMW Group impresses with  outstanding occupant protection for adults and children.  New  interactive airbag between driver and front passenger seats reduces  the risk of injury in the event of a side collision.  Advanced  driver assistance systems help to prevent collisions with pedestrians  and cyclists Munich. With its purely electric drive and  comprehensive range of digital features, the BMW iX represents a new  era in individual mobility. In addition, it operates at the highest  level of safety. This is according to the experts of the European New  Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) – the consumer protection  institute specialising in automotive safety – who awarded the BMW iX  the highest possible rating of five stars in the Euro NCAP safety  assessment. During the course of the test programme, which was further  intensified in 2020, the BMW Group’s new technology flagship impressed  with both its outstanding occupant protection and its advanced driver  assistance systems, which are particularly effective in helping to  prevent accidents.The BMW iX achieved five-star ratings in all test categories of the  Euro NCAP crash test. In the assessment of adult occupant protection,  the testers highlighted among other features the effectiveness of the  new interactive airbag between the driver and front passenger seats,  which provides additional protection against injury in the event of a  side collision. Child safety in the rear of the BMW iX was also given  the highest possible score for both frontal and side collisions.Meanwhile, the integrated safety concept of the BMW iX ensures the  highest level of passenger protection. In addition to precisely  coordinated restraint systems, this includes highly resilient support  structures and precisely designed deformation zones that absorb the  impact of a collision and keep it away from the passenger compartment.  The body structure of the BMW iX combines an aluminium spaceframe  concept with a carbon cage for the passenger compartment. Particularly  torsion-resistant components made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer  (CFRP) are used in the roof, side and rear sections of the BMW iX.“The BMW iX sets new standards in sustainability, and its top rating  of five stars in the Euro NCAP underlines the vehicle’s comprehensive  sustainability concept,” says Dominik Schuster, Head of Vehicle Safety  BMW. “The extremely stable body structure and the extended range of  restraint systems ensure an outstanding level of occupant protection.  In addition, the BMW iX scores highly both in the test programme and  in everyday driving with innovative driver assistance systems that  significantly reduce the risk of accidents in a wide array of  situations.” Among other features, the BMW iX has a front collision  warning system with brake intervention that can detect pedestrians and  cyclists as well as vehicles. In addition, the automatic emergency  braking system now also reacts in turning situations, helping to  minimise the risk to pedestrians when turning and the risk of  collision with oncoming traffic when turning left.If a collision does occur, the risk of injury to vulnerable road  users is reduced by carefully designed body elements and flexible  structures at the front of the vehicle. The BMW iX also features an  active bonnet, which is raised by means of a pyrotechnical triggering  mechanism as soon as the data collected by sensors indicate a  corresponding collision. This creates a deformation zone that prevents  direct impact between the pedestrian or cyclist and hard components in  the engine compartment.Other standard features of the BMW iX include an attention assistant,  lane departure warning and speed limit recognition, all of which  scored positively in the Euro NCAP crash test. The Driving Assistant  Professional package is offered as an option, which also includes  steering and lane guidance assistance. In a separate assessment, BMW’s  Driving Assistant Professional in the iX3 was also recently awarded  the top rating of “very good” by Euro NCAP.The figures for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, power  consumption and range are measured using the methods required  according to Regulation (EC) 2007\/715 as amended. They refer to  vehicles on the automotive market in Germany. For ranges, the WLTP  figures take into account the effects of any optional equipment. All figures have already been determined on the basis of the new WLTP  test cycle. WLTP values are used as a basis for the assessment of  taxes and other vehicle-related levies that are (also) based on  CO2 emissions and, where applicable, for the purposes of  vehicle-specific subsidies. Further information on the WLTP and NEDC  measurement procedures can be found at www.bmw.de\/wltp. More information about the official fuel consumption figures and the  official specific CO2 emissions of new passenger cars can  be obtained from the “Guideline on fuel consumption, CO2  emissions and power consumption of new passenger cars”, available free  of charge from all outlets, from Deutsche Automobil Treuhand GmbH  (DAT), Hellmuth-Hirth-Str. 1, 73760 Ostfildern-Scharnhausen, and at https:\/\/www.dat.de\/co2\/. Please address any queries to: Corporate Communications Dieter Falkensteiner, Press Officer BMW Group Innovation and DesignTelephone: +49-89-382-51813E-mail: Dieter.Falkensteiner@bmwgroup.com Paloma Brunckhorst, Press Officer Product Communications BMW iXTelephone: +49-89-382-22322E-mail: Paloma.Brunckhorst@bmwgroup.com Almut Stollberg, Head of Communications Innovation, Design,  Technology, Digital CarTelephone: +49 89 382 96543E-mail: Almut.Stollberg@bmw.de, Ingo Wirth, Head of Product and Brand Communications BMWTelephone: +49-89-382-25814E-mail: Ingo.Wirth@bmwgroup.com Internet: www.press.bmwgroup.com\/deutschlandE-mail: presse@bmwgroup.com The BMW Group With its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

Both models are being  very well received by customers worldwide – as reflected in new orders  from around the globe. Over the next year, the BMW Group will expand its electrified product  line-up to include fully-electric versions of the BMW 7 Series and BMW  X1. The high-volume BMW 5 Series will be added to the electric  portfolio in 2023. The successor to the MINI Countryman and the  all-electric Rolls-Royce Spectre will follow. By 2023, the company  will already have at least one fully-electric model on the roads in  about 90 percent of its current market segments. Over the next ten  years or so, the BMW Group plans to release a total of about ten  million fully-electric vehicles onto the roads. The Neue Klasse, which is uncompromisingly geared towards electric  drive trains, will make a significant contribution to BMW Group sales  volumes from the middle of the decade. The MINI product range will already be exclusively all-electric by  the early 2030s and Rolls-Royce will be an all-electric brand from  2030 on. All future new models from BMW Motorrad in the field of urban  mobility will also be fully electric. The successful ramp-up of electromobility will depend on swift and  comprehensive expansion of charging infrastructure. The BMW Group is  making a vital contribution to this. “Electromobility needs holistic  thinking and implementation. That is why we don’t just offer our  customers highly attractive electrified cars; we also make sure  charging is easy and convenient. Our commitment spans the entire value  chain: from compelling products and services through strategic  investments, all the way to building our own company charging  infrastructure,” says Dr Andreas Aumann, head of  Strategic Product Management at the BMW Group. BMW Charging and MINI Charging provide customers with access to one  of Europe’s largest charging networks, made up of more than 250,000  charging points. With the “Active” tariff from BMW and MINI Charging,  customers can charge at an attractive market-specific fixed rate that  ensures full transparency. The BMW Group also offers various home  charging solutions with its wallboxes. With the pan-European  high-power charging network IONITY, in which the existing shareholders  and new investor BlackRock additionally invest a total of 700 million  euros for network expansion, the roaming partner aggregator Hubject  and the strategic mobility provider Digital Charging Solutions GmbH,  the BMW Group holds a stake in three companies that will play a key  role in the continued ramp-up of electromobility. With more than 5,000  charging points, the BMW Group also operates one of Germany’s largest  company charging networks.  If you have any questions, please contact: BMW Group Corporate CommunicationsChristina Hepe, Communications SalesTelephone: +49 89 382-38770Email: christina.hepe@bmw.de Eckhard Wannieck, head of Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesTelephone: +49 89 382-24544Email: eckhard.wannieck@bmwgroup.com Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail: presse@bmw.de  The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

After the successful 2021 season, victory in Most    (CZE) and second place overall in the FIM Endurance World    Championship (FIM EWC), the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is now    concentrating fully on preparations for 2022. Team manager Werner    Daemen has taken the team to Almeria in Spain for the first    three-day winter testing session. A new face is in action on the #37    BMW M 1000 RR alongside Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik    (UKR) and Kenny Foray (FRA): Jéremy Guarnoni (FRA). He will be the    new team-mate for Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Foray for the    upcoming 2022 season. The 28-year-old Frenchman Guarnoni is a familiar face in  the Endurance World Championship. He appeared in his first FIM EWC  race at the age of 18, competing in the 2012 Bol d’Or in Magny-Cours  (FRA). He has been a fixture in the FIM EWC since 2018 and became  world champion in the 2018\/19 season. He was also the 2010 Superstock  600 European champion before competing for many years in the FIM  Superstock 1000 Championship, where he claimed third place in the  championship on two occasions and also got to know his new team-mates  Reiterberger and Mikhalchik. Guarnoni spent a season racing in the FIM  Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in 2014. The BMW  Motorrad World Endurance Team is using the test in Almeria to continue  work on optimising the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. New components and set-up  solutions are being evaluated. Together with tyre partner Dunlop, the  team is testing a range of tyre options. Guarnoni also has the option  of using the testing to familiarise himself with the motorbike and the  team. Three race dates have already been confirmed for the  2022 season in the FIM EWC. The season starts on 16th\/17th April with  the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA), the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps will  take place on 4th\/5th June and the 8 Hours of Suzuka (JPN) will return  to the FIM EWC calendar on 7th August. Further race dates are yet to  be confirmed. Quotes on the Almeria test. Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team: “It has been a fantastic year for us, our first full  year in FIM EWC. I am very proud of the whole team and everyone at  BMW, as we finished second in the championship together. I think we  really deserved that, especially the victory in the final race. We are  now here testing for 2022 already. We have a lot to do over the next  few days, but I am very happy with the set-up we have now. Markus,  Ilya and Kenny are excellent guys and top riders. Jéremy Guarnoni is  new to the team. I have been a fan of his since day one. He is a real  endurance rider and a very good addition to the group. We have already  had a lot of fun, which I feel is very important.” Jéremy Guarnoni: “I have a very good impression of  the bike. The performance is really unbelievable, and I immediately  felt good on it. I am also very happy with the team, which is very  professional. I have a really good feeling about the mechanics, the  crew chief and my team-mates. I already knew Ilya, Markus and Kenny as  opponents, and now they are my team-mates. That is really cool. I am  sure we can achieve great things next season, and I am looking forward  to it.” Markus Reiterberger: “Firstly, after a good season in  2021, we know exactly what we need to work on. I am very pleased that  we still have a test this year. That is very important for us, as it  allows us to lay important foundations for the coming year. I am  pleased to be able to welcome Jéremy – another strong rider and a  former world champion – to the team. The first day of testing was  really tiring for everyone, as it was very cold and there was a lot to  test. We got through most of the programme, but there are still a few  important things to do. The initial impressions are definitely  promising. With the improvements we can still make, I believe we will  be able to make up that one position we missed out on this season. I  am very confident and pleased to be part of the team.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “It feels really good to be able to  start preparations for 2022 this year. Firstly, I would like to  welcome our new team member, Jéremy. I hope we can achieve some good  results together. He is a very experienced endurance rider and I think  we will learn a lot from each other. I am very happy to be riding with  him in the team and on this bike. We have made a few improvements. I  think we have a good overall package, with which we can win. We showed  that in the last race. We are now testing a few things, to give  ourselves an even better chance. I believe we have the potential to  challenge at the top next year.” Kenny Foray: “Our winter test is very early, but that  is very good for us. The new bike is even better than the old one. It  is really enjoyable to ride. I am hoping for a really good year for  the whole team. If I am able to contribute to us improving, then I am  definitely ready.”\n"}

At the end of the season, BMW M Motorsport honours the    most successful drivers and teams for their performances in recent    months with the BMW M Sports Trophy awards. Victory in this year’s    Drivers Competition went to American Sean Quinlan. He enjoyed many    successes at the wheel of the BMW M4 GT4 in GT4 America and GT    America. In the Team Competition, FK Performance Motorsport took    first place, courtesy of its title wins in the DTM Trophy and the    Nürburgring Endurance Series. Furthermore, selected drivers were    given the opportunity to join BMW M Motorsport in Almeria (ESP) this    week for a test. “Even though the current pandemic situation is once again preventing  us from celebrating our traditional end-of-season event together with  the private BMW M Motorsport drivers and teams, we will obviously not  miss out on honouring the winners of this season’s BMW M Sports  Trophy,” said Jonas Krauss, Sales Head of Motorsport. “Through their  success in BMW M Motorsport cars, drivers and teams catch the eye all  over the world, making them outstanding ambassadors for the BMW brand.  Congratulations to Sean Quinlan and FK Performance Motorsport, who  have won the BMW M Sports Trophy Driver and Team Competitions for the  first time. A glance at the winners list for both competitions shows  emphatically just how international the BMW M Sports Trophy is.” Quinlan scored points towards the Drivers Competition at the wheel of  the BMW M4 GT4 mostly in the GT4 class of GT America and the Pro-Am  class of GT4 America. In GT America, he took six class victories and  was second overall. In GT4 America, he claimed one race win in the  Pro-Am class and a further four podiums, finishing third in the  Drivers’ Championship. “It is a great honour for me to win the Driver  Competition,” said Quinlan. “The BMW M Sports Trophy was a big thing  for us this year, and we kept an eye on the points to see whether we  might achieve a top result. I had more joy than expected in GT  America, in particular. Thank you to BMW M Motorsport for the  fantastic support throughout the entire season. I am already really  looking forward to next season, in which we will start in the IMSA series.” Second and third places went to the champions in ADAC GT4 Germany and  the DTM Trophy, Michael Schrey (GER) and Ben Green (GBR). Gabriele  Piana (ITA), winner of the BMW M Sports Trophy Drivers Competition for  the past two years and ADAC GT4 Germany champion alongside Schrey in a  BMW M4 GT4 in 2021, finished fourth this year. In the Team Competition, there was no beating FK Performance  Motorsport. The team can look back on an outstanding season. In the  DTM Trophy, both the Team and the Driver title, courtesy of Ben Green,  went the way of FK Performance Motorsport. The team achieved the same  feat in the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup NLS, which was held within the  Nürburgring Endurance Series. The two team principals, Martin Kaemena  and Fabian Finck, are responsible for this success. “For everyone in  our team, being recognised as the best private BMW M Motorsport team  in the world is a fantastic reward for all the hard work,” said  Kaemena. Finck added: “Our team has done an outstanding job this  season. As well as everything we do to create a good atmosphere within  the team, the sporting success is obviously the biggest motivation. As  such, it is great that there is such a strong manufacturer involvement  as the BMW M Sports Trophy. The intensity, with which BMW M Motorsport  supports its private teams within the framework of this competition,  is unique at this moment in time.” BMW M Motorsport attends test in Almeria with selected drivers.Last week, selected drivers were given the opportunity to show what  they are capable of at the wheel of the BMW M6 GT3, under the watchful  eyes of BMW M Motorsport engineers and BMW works driver Philipp Eng  (AUT).

{"prompt":" Hans-Peter Kemser named as plant director for planned site in Debrecen, Hungary  Petra Peterhänsel will take over at Plant Leipzig   ->","completion":" Hans-Peter Kemser named as plant director for planned site in  Debrecen, Hungary  Petra Peterhänsel will take over at Plant  Leipzig   Munich. The BMW Group has named Hans-Peter Kemser as  plant director for the planned site in Debrecen, Hungary. He will  oversee construction of the future plant from January onwards. The  56-year-old is currently in charge of BMW Group Plant Leipzig. Petra  Peterhänsel will take over from him as head of the site in Saxony. The  55-year-old currently manages the Painted Body, i.e. press shop, body  shop and paint shop technologies, at the BMW Group’s largest European  plant in Dingolfing. Hans-Peter Kemser will bring years of expertise in the fields of  vehicle production and electromobility to his new role from January  onwards. He has been in charge of BMW Group Plant Leipzig since 2015,  where he was responsible for production of the BMW 1 Series and 2  Series ranges, as well as the fully-electric BMW i3* and, up until  2020, the BMW i8. “Hans-Peter Kemser is an absolute production expert  and his years of experience make him the perfect choice for  successfully implementing the plant ramp-up in Debrecen,” said Milan  Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible  for production. From 2025 onwards, Debrecen will produce the Neue  Klasse, which will be uncompromisingly geared towards electric drive trains. Petra Peterhänsel will take over as the new head of Plant Leipzig.  The trained quality specialist has been with the BMW Group since 2012  and brings a wealth of international experience spanning all areas of  the automotive industry. “I am delighted to welcome an experienced  production expert like Petra Peterhänsel to strengthen our management  team,” underlined Nedeljković: “Just like Hans-Peter Kemser, she  brings extensive process know-how and outstanding leadership  qualities. Both will push forward with our focus topics, the  transformation towards electromobility, digitalisation and further  expansion of sustainability.” Exciting challenges await the designated plant directors at both locations. Construction of the first buildings for the future BMW Group plant in  Debrecen in the east of Hungary will get underway in early 2022,  starting with the central office building and a training centre, to  complement the infrastructure that has already been built, with roads  and car parks, as well as water and energy supplies. The buildings and  equipment required for car production will be put out to tender in the  near future. All technologies – from press shop to body shop, paint  shop and assembly – are planned for BMW Group Plant Debrecen. The  plant will be the first production location for the Neue Klasse. Going  forward, the site will employ up to 1,000 people, so that up to  150,000 vehicles per year can be built in Hungary. At the time of its  planned commissioning in 2025, the plant will set new benchmarks for  flexibility, digitalisation and productivity in production. Electrification also continues to progress in Leipzig. The plant  recently celebrated 20 years since the decision to build in Leipzig  and, today, it is the BMW Group’s pioneer plant for electromobility:  It has been building the BMW Group’s first fully-electric vehicle, the  BMW i3*, since 2013. The location also began producing battery modules  this year, creating around 175 new jobs in this area so far. The  company has already decided to further increase capacity: A second  production line will come on stream in 2022. The expertise and  experience gained by staff at our site in the field of electromobility  over the years will also be leveraged for production of the successor  to the MINI Countryman, which will be built in Leipzig as a  fully-electric vehicle.\n"}
{"prompt":"Prototypes of the world’s first purely electrically powered luxury sedan complete final testing of drive and suspension systems at the BMW Group winter test centre in Arjeplog, Sweden.  ->","completion":" Munich. With the consistent expansion of its range to  further vehicle segments, the BMW Group is pushing ahead with the  transformation to electric mobility. During the forthcoming year, the  Munich-based premium automobile manufacturer will already present the  world’s first all-electric luxury sedan – the BMW i7 (power  consumption combined: 22.5 – 19.5 kWh\/100 km according to WLTP; CO2  emissions: 0 g\/km; prognosis based on the vehicle’s current level of  development). Within the framework of its series development process,  the BMW i7 is currently undergoing driving dynamics testing on the  premises of the BMW Group winter test centre in Arjeplog, Sweden.  There, just a few kilometres away from the Arctic Circle, test  engineers find the frozen surfaces and snow-covered roads offering the  ideal preconditions for the integrated application of all drive and  suspension systems. With the test programme held in the biting cold,  they pave the way to a new interpretation of luxury driving pleasure.  For the first time, it will be possible to experience a maximum in  characteristic BMW dynamics, comfort and supremacy in the luxury class  with absolutely zero local emissions.The suspension components, steering and braking systems as well as  driving dynamics and vehicle stability systems developed for the  future generation of the BMW 7 Series are designed to raise the  balance between sportiness and ride comfort so typical of the brand’s  luxury sedans to the next level. This also includes  performance-oriented tuning of the wheel suspension, springs, dampers  and various regulating systems to match the various different drive  types. They all undergo intensive testing in Arjeplog under extreme  climate conditions.In Lapland’s winter landscape, the test engineers find the perfect  preconditions for this. During test drives around the snow-covered  roads around Arjeplog, they are able to test and optimise all  functions under extremely challenging conditions in order to achieve  an absolutely harmonious and BMW-typical driving experience. Moreover,  they make use of test surfaces on frozen lakes with their low road  friction coefficient in order to achieve particularly fine tuning of  suspension control systems. The steering application undergoes  meticulous tuning as do the numerous functions of the Dynamic  Stability Control system (DSC) and the accurately regulated  interaction between friction brake and deceleration by means of energy recuperation. The winter programme also focuses in particular on the components of  the all-electric drive system. The BMW i7’s electric drive,  high-voltage battery, power electronics and charging technology all  originate from the fifth generation of BMW eDrive technology, which  already provides for sustainable driving pleasure in the BMW iX. Above  all, it is the motor, the battery and the temperature control system  of the BMW i7 that prove their high level of maturity in extreme  sub-zero temperatures in the north of Sweden.With the BMW i7, the brand’s current model offensive in the luxury  segment is being continued in a particularly progressive way. For the  first time, it is possible to experience a luxury sedan that is  characterised by elegance, ride comfort and supremacy without  restriction and in conjunction with a purely electric drive system.  The BMW i7 is based on the same vehicle concept as all further model  variants of the BMW 7 Series. This integrated development also  guarantees locally emission-free driving with the characteristic  combination of both sporty and comfort-oriented handling properties  along with the exclusive spaciousness of a BMW luxury sedan. \n"}

Lighting the way after the Festive MINI  Electric’s first public appearance at The Lexicon Bracknell in  Berkshire, on the 25th November, the car is travelling to  various locations around the UK, driven by project creator Nicholas  ‘Nico’ Martin.The sen-sleigh-tional project first started over three years ago,  with Nico hand-wrapping his MINI in fairy-lights and displaying it in  his local town of Bracknell. However, in December 2020, without the  usual Christmas switch-on displays delivering much-needed festive  spirit, Nico realised he could use the Festive MINI to bring joy and  positivity to people on their own doorsteps, whilst also raising  awareness and over £5000 for the MS  Trust and Duchenne UK,  two charities very close to his heart.Nico said, “I’m so pleased to be back with the Festive MINI charity  tour. I just knew last year I had an opportunity to cheer people up  and also to raise funds for the MS Trust and Duchenne UK. Both  charities mean a lot to me - unfortunately my mother was diagnosed  with Multiple Sclerosis six years ago, and in 2019 I was asked to take  the Festive MINI to surprise an incredible young boy, Marcus Rooks,  who was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. When I saw his  face light up with so much joy and excitement, I realised that I had  created something truly special. Ever since meeting him and learning  about his condition, I’ve wanted to support him in any way I can.”This year, Nico has introduced a guest charity spot taken up by Alzheimer’s Society and he  has rallied support from MINI UK, Festive Lights and Italian smart  lighting company Twinkly, to up the voltage on his project and make it  bigger and better than ever, with an aim of raising as much money as  possible for the three special causes.Nico added: “I’m so grateful for the incredible support behind the  project and the teams involved this year.

{"prompt":" € 5.5 million for endowed chair and networking fund  An important milestone for the industrialisation of quantum computing   ->","completion":" Munich \/ Aachen. As one of the most promising future  technologies, quantum computing has an enormous innovation potential.  The BMW Group will in the future support research into the future  technology of quantum computing at the RWTH Aachen University, thus  once again emphasising its leading role in the development of a  quantum ecosystem.Prof. Dr. Ulrich Rüdiger, Rector of the RWTH Aachen University,  Alexander Buresch, CIO of BMW AG, and Dr. Stefan Floeck, Executive  Mentor of the Strategic Partnership of the BMW Group and RWTH Aachen  University and Senior Vice President Product Line MINI and BMW Compact  Class, have signed the contract for establishing the \"Quantum  Information Systems\" endowed chair.The BMW Group is providing € 4.5 million over a period of six years  for professorship, equipment, and employees at the RWTH Aachen  University. A further € 1.0 million will be paid into a networking  fund that supports industrial research projects and ensures that the  chair is integrated in the university environment and in the research  centre Jülich. In the chair the use cases from the core business of  the BMW Group with a potential quantum advantage are contemplated  comprehensively in terms of industrialisation. The common higher-order  objective of the RWTH Aachen University and the BMW Group is to close  the gap between outstanding basic research in Germany and the  applicability of quantum computing in industry.Dr. Stefan Floeck: “The BMW Group can look back on  many years of strategic partnership with the RWTH Aachen University.  The close cooperation between companies and universities is mutually  beneficial – we at the BMW Group are convinced of that. With its  excellent networked ecosystem and technological focus, the RWTH Aachen  University is the perfect home for the endowed chair, which will offer  valuable insight into the industrialisation of quantum solutions.”Prof. Dr. Ulrich Rüdiger: “Quantum technology is one of the major topics of  the future, with enormous innovation potential for our social  progress. With this endowed professorship, we can intensify our  research in this area. As RWTH Aachen University, we like working in  networks. We are convinced that we achieve the best solutions for  future topics through a continuous exchange of knowledge and  technology with partners from science, industry and society.”Alexander Buresch: “The endowed chair at the RWTH  Aachen University is an important step towards the potential use of  quantum computing at the BMW Group. It creates software and  integration competencies that are necessary for the industrialisation  of the quantum computing ecosystem. Together with the Quantum  Algorithms and Applications endowed chair at the Technical University  of Munich, which we announced in June this year, we hope to unlock  potential within the automotive value chain based on an end-to-end approach.”Another endowed chair for outstanding basic research in  GermanyQuantum computing utilises quantum mechanical  effects to accelerate computing capacity. As one of the most promising  technologies of the future, it has the potential to push the limits of  what is possible to date and revolutionise fields of application from  material research to automated driving. The technology environment in  the field of quantum computing is still only in its beginnings.  University collaborations thus offer great potential.On 16 June of this year, the BMW Group, together with the Technical  University of Munich (TUM), already announced the establishment of the  \"Quantum Algorithms and Applications\" endowed chair. The BMW  Group will provide € 5.1 million over a period of six years for  professorship, equipment, and employees at TUM. The chair addresses  the development of algorithms related to use cases along the  industrial value chain.For the BMW Group, the \"Quantum Information Systems\"  endowed chair at RWTH Aachen University is an important addition to  the existing chair in Munich. It contemplates use cases from the BMW  Group's core business comprehensively in terms of industrialisation.  Software integration and industrialisation skills are being created to  implement a quantum advantage in the medium term.The strategic partnership between the RWTH Aachen University    and the BMW GroupAs one of the leading technical  universities in Europe, the RWTH Aachen University has been a  strategic partner of the BMW Group since 2017. The RWTH Innovation is  responsible for the key account management of the cooperation as the  university's central, cross-university research and technology  transfer unit. It supports the BMW Group in networking, initiating,  and coordinating projects at the RWTH Aachen University. Dr. Stefan  Floeck, Senior Vice President Product Line MINI and BMW Compact Class,  was appointed Executive Mentor of the partnership and is thus the link  between the BMW Group and the RWTH Aachen University. His role  includes continuously developing the partnership and pressing ahead  with the cooperation.The scientists and also the young academics at the technical  university are already cooperating closely with the development  departments of the BMW Group. The BMW Group itself provides students  with practical information on requirements from industry. This can  also be seen in the research promotion project KIZAM (Artificial  Intelligence in requirements management). Four institutes of RWTH  Aachen University, four departments of the BMW Group and four other  industrial partners are involved in research on how Artificial  Intelligence can accelerate and improve product development. The first  joint Technology Day was a highlight of the strategic partnership,  which provided a platform for dialogue between science and business in  June of this year.\n"}

{"prompt":" With its two innovative technology flagships, the BMW i4 and BMW iX, the BMW Group line-up now features five fully-electric vehicles  Bernhard Kuhnt, Senior Vice President BMW Group Market Germany: “One in four BMWs in Germany already electrified”    ->","completion":" Munich. From the heart of the BMW brand –  fully-electric on the road: The first BMW i4 vehicles were delivered  at the BMW Welt last weekend. Bernhard Kuhnt, Senior Vice    President BMW Group Market Germany, is delighted: \"It  is a very special moment for us when we hand over brand new models to  customers for the first time. The BMW i4 shows in an emotional way how  well fully-electric mobility and sporty driving dynamics fit together.  For us, it is therefore clear: the BMW i4 will offer our customers a  whole new dimension of driving pleasure.\" On this special occasion, the BMW Group did not miss the opportunity  to invite the customers of the first BMW i4s to an accompanying  programme around the fully-electric Gran Coupé in Munich. Customers are excitedStefan Ballin, owner of an electrical contracting company and one of  the first customers, was delighted to take delivery of his BMW i4: “It  wasn’t possible, at the time I placed the order, to take a test drive,  but I knew the BMW i4 was exactly the right car for me! I was  impressed by the concept – the symbiosis of range, elegant design and  unmistakeable BMW sportiness. I also wanted a car that would show how  we, as an innovative company, can comfortably integrate  electromobility into both our private and working environments. I’m  also looking forward to sporty driving pleasure with zero emissions in  the i4 – because the electricity I need to run it will come from our  own photovoltaic system.” Bernhardt Kuhnt confirmed: “With the BMW i4, we have  absolutely struck a chord. You can see this from the very high demand  for this car. We are delighted to be expanding our electrified product  line-up with this sporty, fully-electric Gran Coupé at exactly the  right time and to present the first vehicles to our customers today –  three months earlier than originally planned. The first delivery of a  BMW i4 today, and the first BMW iX in about a week, are further  milestones for the BMW Group on the road to electromobility.” One in four BMW Group vehicles in Germany electrifiedKuhnt goes on to explain: “One in four BMWs delivered in Germany  today already comes with a fully-electric drive train or is a plug-in  hybrid. By the end of the third quarter, around 41,900 electrified  BMWs and 8,820 electrified MINIs had been delivered to customers this  year. The fully-electric MINI Cooper SE alone already accounts for  about 20 percent of MINI brand sales. The BMW Group has almost doubled  its sales of electrified models in Germany compared with the previous  year, at around 25 percent.” Impressive driving dynamics thanks to model-specific chassis    technology and electric drive trainThe BMW i4 combines characteristic sportiness with elegant design –  and brings electromobility to the traditional core of the BMW brand.  The four-door Gran Coupé is the first fully-electric BMW consistently  geared towards driving dynamics. Impressive driving dynamics and high  range are combined by harnessing the power of efficient drive  technology and intelligent lightweight construction. Range and innovative technology were also purchasing considerations  for Ronny Scharschmidt, whose firm implements regional construction  projects with renewable energies: “I decided on the i4 because of the  range and the many new driving functions and on-board sensors that  make driving safer and more comfortable. My first long drive in the  BMW i4 will be from Munich directly home to Saxony-Anhalt: In the  meantime, there are enough fast chargers that you don’t have to worry  about charging anymore.” Convenient chargingWhen BMW Group customers buy an electrified vehicle, it comes with a  BMW or MINI Charging Card that gives them access to one of the world’s  largest charging networks. BMW also offers two options for convenient  charging at home: the BMW Wallbox and the Smart Wallbox from BMW Group  partner NewMotion. For example, this wallbox also enables company car  drivers to precisely record charging processes for accounting purposes.  BMW Group electro-offensive continuesIn addition to the two main innovation flagships, the BMW iX and BMW  i4, the BMW i3, MINI SE* and BMW iX3* are already on the market. These  will be followed in the coming years by fully-electric versions of the  BMW 7 Series, BMW X1 and the high-volume BMW 5 Series. Every plant in  Germany will produce fully-electric cars from 2022 onwards. A  fully-electric successor to the MINI Countryman and the all-electric  Rolls-Royce Spectre will also be released onto the market. By 2023,  the BMW Group will have at least one fully-electric model on the roads  in about 90 percent of its current market segments. The BMW Group  expects fully-electric vehicles to account for at least 50 percent of  its global sales in 2030. *Consumption\/emissions data:BMW iX3: Power consumption in kWh\/100 km combined:  18.9-18.5 WLTPMINI Cooper SE: Power consumption in kWh\/100 km  combined: 16.9-14.9 NEDC, 17.6-15.2 WLTPIf you have any questions, please contact:   BMW Group Corporate Communications Micaela Sandstede, press spokesperson, Market GermanyTelephone: +49 89 382-61611E-mail: Micaela.sandstede@bmwgroup.com Eckhard Wannieck, Head of Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesTelephone: +49 89 382-24544E-mail: eckhard.wannieck@bmwgroup.com Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comE-mail: presse@bmw.de  The BMW Group With its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

{"prompt":" Innovative eDrive Zones for local emission-free driving available in 20 new  cities  Around three million kilometers driven electrically instead of “fossil” in three months  Plug-in hybrids make sense for many real-world customer driving profiles  ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is introducing its innovative  eDrive Zones in another 20 European cities, including Copenhagen,  Verona and Toulouse. This means that a total of 138 cities in Europe  are now benefiting from this trailblazing technology. The service is  expected to be rolled out in at least another 30 cities worldwide in  the coming year.In an eDrive Zone, BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles automatically switch  to all-electric driving mode upon entering inner city areas. Then, the  plug-in hybrid models drive locally emission-free – just like purely  electric vehicles – and with low fuel costs, as electric motors are  much more efficient than combustion engines for driving in city  traffic. The vehicle recognises the designated areas using geofencing  technology and GPS. The automated eDrive feature is available as  standard in many existing and all future BMW plug-in hybrids. Drivers  are rewarded with bonus points for each all-electric kilometre driven  – and with double points in an eDrive Zone – which they can redeem for  charging credit. In turn, drivers also collect bonus points while  charging their vehicle.The 20 latest cities to be added are: Aberdeen, Bregenz, Brescia,  Bristol, Cambridge, Cardiff, Copenhagen, Cork, Coventry, Florence,  Klagenfurt, Lille, Matosinhos, Naples, Oeiras, Oxford, Sheffield, St.  Pölten, Toulouse and Verona.More quality of life in inner cities thanks to eDrive Zones. BMW eDrive Zones and the loyalty program for charging credit are a  success story – for inner city emissions levels and for drivers. An  overview of the usage data shows: Plug-in hybrids as important technology to meet the BMW Group    fleet target of 50% less CO2 emissions per kilometre by 2030.As electric mobility gathers pace, the BMW Group has consciously  opted for fully electric models and plug-in hybrid technology. The  company offers a total of 17 plug-in hybrid models in 95 markets  worldwide. eDrive Zones will now enable the potential of this  technology to be leveraged even further: if the plug-in hybrid vehicle  is charged regularly, daily distances in particular can be covered  locally emission-free. This includes millions of daily commutes in  Europe, for example. In urban centres with high volumes of traffic,  plug-in hybrids make an important contribution towards reducing  CO2. Using this technology also cuts pollution and noise  and thus improves the quality of life in cities. Over their entire  life cycle, BMW plug-in hybrids have a demonstrably lower  CO2 impact than conventionally powered models, even when  charged with EU normal electricity instead of green electricity. BMW plug-in hybrid vehicles have long offered considerable    benefits as compared to those with traditional drives: Consistent advancement of BMW plug-in hybrid technology.The market launch of the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer next year  marks the start of a broad roll-out of fifth-generation BMW plug-in  hybrids. It uses state-of-the-art components of the latest BMW Gen5  technology, such as the highly integrated e-drive unit, in which the  e-machine, transmission and power electronics are compactly combined  in a single body. This brings additional significant increases in  terms of efficiency and dynamics. Positive overall CO2 balance for BMW plug-in hybrids.Sometimes the \"real\" life cycle assessment of plug-in  hybrid vehicles is questioned, especially in markets with a low share  of green electricity in the public grid. For BMW plug-in-hybrid  models, the BMW Group has had CO2 certificates drawn up for  the entire cycle from raw material procurement, supply chain,  production and use phase to recycling.When charging with European average electricity during the use  phase, the BMW  plug-in-hybrid models show substantial CO2  savings compared to their conventionally driven counterparts. The BMW  Group does not launch an electrified vehicle without proof of this kind. List of cities with BMW eDrive Zones as of November 2021.The benefits of the digital BMW eDrive Zone service can be  experienced in a large number of major European cities. The list will  be expanded in the future to include additional countries and cities,  so that the electric driving shares of plug-in hybrid models can be  increased further in a steadily growing number of city areas. In  Germany, many of the eDrive Zones are identical to the so-called  “Umweltzonen”.

{"prompt":"On the occasion of its 50th anniversary, the classic \"BMW Motorsport\" emblem returns – on request for BMW M automobiles and BMW models with M Sport package. Kick-off to a year full of product highlights and major appearances by the performance brand. ->","completion":" Munich. May 24, 2022 marks the 50th  anniversary of the foundation of BMW M GmbH. Almost a quarter of a  year earlier, the BMW Group subsidiary is already demonstrating a  sense of tradition and anniversary spirit on its current products.  Customers who opt for a BMW M automobile or a BMW model equipped with  an M Sport package with a production date from March 2022 can have  their vehicle’s front, rear and wheel hubs decorated with emblems  inspired by the classic \"BMW Motorsport\" logo. As an  alternative to the conventional BMW emblem, it signals passion for  racing and for the roots of the BMW M brand. This unique offer in the  history of BMW M will be available for order from the end of January 2022.In addition to the emblems, 50 iconic and historically significant  BMW M paint finishes will be offered for selected models in the  anniversary year 2022. Style-defining colors such as Dakar Yellow,  Fire Orange, Daytona Violet, Macao Blue, Imola Red or Frozen Marina  Bay Blue refer to the various eras of BMW M's 50-year history.The BMW logo with the shifted semicircles in blue, violet and red was  first used in 1973 on the racing car of BMW Motorsport GmbH, which had  been established a year before. In 1978 and with the debut of the BMW  M1 the three color stripes slanted to the right and leaning on the  letter M followed. Even beyond the motorsport scene it became a  trademark with particularly high recognition value and identification  power. The legendary BMW M1 was the only BMW M high-performance  production vehicle to bear the historic motorsport emblem in addition  to the logo with the three color stripes. In both logos, the blue  stands for BMW, while the red symbolizes racing and the violet  expresses the connection between the two. In the meantime, the violet  has given way to a dark blue, and BMW Motorsport GmbH has been  operating under the name BMW M GmbH since 1993. Nothing has changed  the high symbolic power of the brand and logo. In its 50th  year of existence, the company is more successful than ever as the  world market leader in the performance and high-performance automotive segment.\"With the classic 'BMW Motorsport' emblem, we would like to  share our joy about the anniversary of BMW M GmbH with the fans of the  brand,\" says Franciscus van Meel, Chairman of the Board of  Management of BMW M GmbH. \"We have a great year ahead of us,  which will be celebrated with unique product highlights and exciting  performances. The M has long been considered the strongest letter in  the world, and in our company's anniversary year it is stronger than ever.\"BMW M GmbH is also aiming for another sales record in 2021. Its  performance and high-performance automobiles are enjoying steadily  growing popularity worldwide, which will be fueled once again with new  product highlights in the anniversary year. For the first time, the  company is launching a BMW M3 Touring in the course of 2022. In  addition, particularly performance-oriented fans of the brand can look  forward to a spectacular special model of the BMW M4 Coupé series. The  successor model to the successful BMW M2 is also already at an  advanced stage of its series development process. In parallel, the  electrification of the BMW M brand is also being driven forward. In  the anniversary year, the first electrified high-performance model in  the history of BMW M GmbH will be launched.BMW M GmbH will not only celebrate its anniversary with attractive  new products, but also with numerous events. Anniversary performances  are planned in May 2022 at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este on  Lake Como in Northern Italy, followed by the Goodwood Festival of  Speed in Great Britain and the Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach,  California. The 24-hour race at the Nürburgring is also a welcome  occasion for BMW M GmbH to review its own successful history together  with fans and to thrill them for the future of BMW M GmbH.\n"}

The ST Racing team’s first year in  endurance racing proved to be an extremely successful one. The trio of  Samantha Tan (CAN), Chandler Hull and Jon Miller (both USA) won three  of the eight races in the GT4 class at the wheel of the BMW M4 GT4.  Tan, Hull and Chandler competed alongside Nick Wittmer (CAN) and  Bryson Morris (USA) at the 24 Hours of Sebring. They finished second  in the class, which was enough to earn ST Racing no fewer than six  titles in the 24H Series. The team won the Overall GT Teams and the  GT4 class Teams classifications. Tan, Hull and Miller were crowned  Overall GT Drivers and GT4 class Drivers champions, while Tan picked  up the titles in the GT4 Drivers GT Junior Cup and the GT Ladies Cup. “We owe each and every member of our team a massive thank you for  consistently working hard and putting in their best effort throughout  the season to make it all happen,” Tan said. “It definitely wasn’t  easy and we had our fair share of disappointments, but we never gave  up and thankfully it all paid off in the end. Thank you also to BMW M  Motorsport and our partners.” Next season, ST Racing will compete in  the GT3 class, in which it will run the new BMW M4 GT3. Another BMW M Motorsport team raced in the 24 Hours of Sebring with  the BMW M4 GT4, in the form of Team ACP – Tanger Associates.

BMW M Motorsport and the BMW Junior Team ended two    eventful weeks in North America with the 24 Hours of Sebring (USA).    Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA) started    with a visit to BMW Team RLL at Petit Le Mans, Road Atlanta (USA).    This was followed by a tour of the BMW Group plant in Spartanburg    (USA), a trip to see Verhagen’s family at their home, and then the    test race with the new BMW M4 GT3 at Sebring International Raceway,    where Hesse and Verhagen competed alongside US drivers Bill    Auberlen, Robby Foley and James Clay. The race in the Creventic 24H    Series served as the final test for the new car at one of the    toughest circuits in the world. BMW M Motorsport also used the    weekend to hand over the new BMW M4 GT3 from the test crew at BMW    Team RMG to the North American teams. BMW Junior Team on tour.For Harper, Hesse and Verhagen, the USA trip began at the season  finale of the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, where they  accompanied the BMW works drivers and BMW Team RLL all weekend,  attended important meetings, and experienced the processes in a BMW M  Motorsports works programme at first hand. “We learned an awful lot in  the collaboration with BMW Team RLL and the BMW works drivers,” said  Hesse. “Plus, it was nice to be involved in the farewell race for the  BMW M8 GTE and sample the atmosphere at Road Atlanta.” This was followed by a trip to the largest BMW Group plant in the  world, in Spartanburg, where the BMW Junior Team gained first-hand  insights into the production of BMW X models. “As we are representing  BMW as drivers, it was cool for us to see how production works in the  largest plant in the world in Spartanburg,” said Verhagen. “It is  huge, and we only saw a small part of it. Hopefully, we will return  sometime and check out some other areas. It was really fascinating.” Harper, Hesse and Verhagen, together with their mentor Jochen  Neerpasch, who accompanied the BMW Junior Team throughout the entire  trip, then visited the BMW Car Club of America Foundation, which  possesses a fascinating exhibition of vintage BMW vehicles and other  BMW collectibles. A special wall drawing was dedicated to the  motorsport history of Jochen Neerpasch. The group saw out the evening  with a barbecue with Verhagen’s family, who live in Mooresville (USA)  near Spartanburg. For Neerpasch and the Juniors, the trip to the USA marked the end of  two years together. “So far, the guys have exceeded the expectations  we had of them at the start, which were pretty high anyway,” said  Neerpasch. “All that they are missing is experience. They are already  setting lap times like those of the top drivers. They need more race  outings, and they are sure to get them next season.” Harper was also positive in his appraisal of his time as a BMW Junior  so far: “We have come a long way since the first NLS race almost two  years ago. It is incredible how much we have learned in that time –  both as racing drivers and as people. Our training is hard, but it is  paying dividends. I think our results in the BMW M6 GT3 this season  have proved that.” BMW M4 GT3 test outing under race conditions at Sebring.Last weekend was all about the BMW M4 GT3 – not only for the BMW  Junior Team, but also for BMW M Motorsport. The 24 Hours of Sebring  was the final endurance test for the car, before it goes in search of  victories and titles from January 2022. When it does so, it will be in  the hands of private BMW M Motorsport teams, some of which are based  in North America. For this reason, BMW M Motorsport took the opportunity at Sebring to  hand over the BMW M4 GT3 from the test crew, BMW Team RMG, to the US  teams, who will run the car in the coming season. Engineers and  mechanics from BMW Teams RMG and RLL worked together for the outing at  Sebring. The Turner Motorsport and BimmerWorld Racing teams were also  involved with drivers Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley and James Clay and  gained valuable experience with the new car. The joint learning began with tests during the week and peaked with  the 24-hour race at one of the toughest circuits in the world, with  countless bumps that really put the car through its paces. After two  repairs, following collisions, and some minor issues during the race,  the BMW M4 GT3 crossed the finish line after 457 laps. Hesse and  Verhagen were the two Juniors who took part in the race. Harper was  only involved in the tests, as he is classed as a Gold driver, of  which only one may be registered per team. The Gold driver for this  race was Auberlen. “The circuit is different to the ones we are  familiar with in Europe,” said Hesse, summing up the test under race  conditions. “Unfortunately, there were two incidents in the race,  which resulted in long repairs. Apart from that, the BMW M4 GT3 did  very well. Racing here was a valuable experience.” The American drivers drew a very positive conclusion. “The first  impression of the BMW M4 GT3 is that it looks fantastic,” said  Auberlen. “Then I drove it, and I can say that it is far better in  every area than the BMW M6 GT3. With a 24-hour race in Sebring, we put  the BMW M4 GT3 to the toughest test imaginable.” Foley said: “A fantastic car. You can immediately feel the two years  of development that have been invested in the BMW M4 GT3. The systems  in the interior, with which the driver works, are a big step forward  compared to the BMW M6 GT3. The car is very user-friendly.” This was backed up by Clay, who was driving a GT3 race car for the  first time in Sebring: “Given that the BMW M4 GT3 is far faster than  the GT4 cars I have driven previously, I found it very easy to adapt  to the car, as the car is very well thought out and easy to operate. I  was able to focus fully on the driving.” The BMW M4 GT3 will contest its first race in the hands of BMW M  Motorsport teams in January 2022, at the 24 Hours of Dubai (UAE). This  will be followed by the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) at the end of the  month. The detailed race programme for the BMW Junior Team will be  announced at a later date. \n"}

Total  investment in the new building is approximately $100 million. When  completed, the new logistics center will be nearly one million square  feet in size with an opportunity for future expansion. “For nearly three decades, BMW has called South Carolina its second  home. This expansion in our logistics operation represents our  continued commitment to this state, and it will prepare Plant  Spartanburg for the future,” said Dr. Robert Engelhorn, president and  CEO of BMW Manufacturing. “The new warehouse will allow us to  consolidate our logistics processes as well as implement efficiency  measures for a more sustainable logistics operation.”  When the new logistics center opens in the middle of 2022, it will  allow BMW to consolidate two offsite warehouse operations – one for  returnable containers and another for body shop parts – into one  efficient onsite location. Inside the warehouse, shipments from  suppliers will be sorted, then delivered to their respective Plant  Spartanburg technologies. The result is a faster, leaner, more  efficient supply chain. To minimize the impact of truck traffic in the area and allow for  easy access to BMW, two private bridges will be constructed to connect  the logistics center to the BMW campus. Update on New BMW Training CenterConstruction is well underway on the new $20 million, 67,000 square  foot training center on the BMW campus, which was announced in  February. When completed in the summer of 2022, the building will  feature multiple classrooms for both professional development and  technical training, an outdoor amphitheater, and a unique concept of  outdoor meeting and workspace that includes wireless capabilities. The  training center will also be home to BMW’s well-known apprenticeship  program – BMW Scholars.  Since 1992, the BMW Group has invested more than $11.4 billion in its  South Carolina factory. BMW Group Plant Spartanburg is the largest BMW  Group plant in the world, producing more than 1,500 vehicles each day.  The plant exports more than two-thirds of its models to 125 global  markets.

It  is brand new for everybody, obviously. Also, we welcome Tom back to  the team. It’s a pretty long time since he got injured in Catalunya so  we are delighted that Tom can come back and finish the season with the  team. The weather forecast, typically in this part of the world, is  very changeable. It’s very hot and humid but with a very high chance  of rain every day. So we will prepare for every eventuality. Overall,  we are looking forward to the season finale and hope we can make it  great final races of the season.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I’m very much  looking forward to getting back on my BMW M 1000 RR. It has been a  long time since I last raced and obviously we have a little bit of  work to do to catch up. But having said that, I have to say that the  excitement of going to a totally new venue is quite something, not  only because Indonesia is a great part of the world. Everybody looks  to be doing an incredible job on the new circuit of Mandalika. What a  unique venue – to say the least. On top of that, it is located on a  beautiful island so I am really looking forward to it. It is new for  everybody and I have to say that it is going to be a little bit of a  way to finish the season, but that’s another story. In general, it’s a  great place to finish the season, and hopefully we can finish it with  some strong results to end 2021.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It’s fantastic to go to Indonesia. It’s nice to have a new  circuit on the calendar, especially in Asia. I love to go there. It’s  also incredible that it’s the last round of the season already. I  cannot wait to try the Mandalika circuit because it looks really nice  from what I have seen. Getting to know a new track is not too  difficult; it comes with doing the laps. I think that it will be a  great season finale. We had some strong weekends this year and  obviously that’s the same way we want to finish the season.” \n"}

After two Rolex 24 victories in Daytona (USA)    and five IMSA series class wins, the farewell race of the MOTUL BMW    M8 GTE added the 26th podium finish and a pole position    to the history books. At Petit Le Mans, the final race of the season    in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Road Atlanta    (USA), Jesse Krohn (FIN) put the #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE on pole    position in class and led the field into the last race of the GTLM    era. The race proved to be tougher than qualifying but shortly    before the end of the ten hours, Krohn and his BMW Team RLL    colleagues John Edwards (USA) and Augusto Farfus (BRA) took over P3    and could step on the GTLM podium one final time. The #25 sister car    and the Turner Motorsport BMW M6 GT3 had to retire due to race incidents. On a special weekend for BMW M Motorsport, BMW of North America and  the IMSA series, the MOTUL BMW M8 GTE took its final bow from racing  as a pole-sitter and podium finisher. After a dominant performance by  Krohn in qualifying on Friday that was awarded with pole position in  GTLM class, both cars struggled to match their oppenents’ pace in the  last ever GTLM contest. BMW Team RLL kept fighting until the end and  was awarded with a late promotion to P3 in the race. Farfus had the  honour of finishing the last stint of the last race for the BMW M8 GTE. The #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE made good progress from the P6 starting  position on the GTLM grid. Unfortunately, the car had to be retired  following an incident involving Connor De Phillippi (USA), leaving him  and his fellow drivers Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT)  disappointed. After the farewell of the BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL now  sets sights towards its future in GTD Pro with the BMW M4 GT3 in 2022  and in the LMDh class with the BMW M LMDh in 2023. Turner Motorsport had a disappointing final weekend of the IMSA  season with DNFs with the BMW M6 GT3 in GTD class as well as with both  BMW M4 GT4s in Friday’s IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge season finale. Special guests of BMW of North America at Petit Le Mans were Jochen  Neerpasch, founder of BMW Motorsport GmbH in 1972, and the current BMW  Junior Team drivers Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil  Verhagen (USA). Quotes after the MOTUL Petit Le Mans: Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “What a day!  Bidding farewell to the GTLM class, the BMW M8 GTE, the BMW M6 GT3,  added by a showrun with the BMW M4 GT3. Before that we confirmed BMW  Team RLL as our partner for the coming years in North America and  published first pictures as well as a name for our future BMW M LMDh  project. Thanks to everybody who put a lot of effort in the BMW M8  GTE. Podium and pole position in the final race are a nice conclusion.  Now we open a new chapter and look forward to the BMW M4 GT3, that  will do a test race next week in Sebring.” John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd  place): “It was a bit of a surprising podium at the end but  it is really nice to sign off the BMW M8 GTE with a successful weekend  – qualifying on pole and finishing on the podium. We desparately  wanted to win that one after last year’s heart break when we were  leading in the last hour before being pushed off the track. But it is  a positive end to the era of the M8. Now we are looking forward to the  BMW M4 GT3 and hopefully we can celebrate of the same success with  that car.” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE,    3rd place): “Obviously, we wanted to finish the  season and the BMW M8 GTE programme with a win but today it just  wasn’t in the cards. We did all that we could but the Porsches were  just too fast and the Corvettes as well so this was basically the  maximum result that we could achieve. I am super happy for the team  that we got this. Obviously we wanted to win but that didn’t happen today.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, 3rd  place): “I was pleased to do the final stint in the M8 GTE. I  think we have to be proud of ourselves, we did what we could. It was  the maximum we could achieve. We brought to the end the result that  was possible today. We close a chapter but it is a long book. The BMW  M4 GT3 is just around the corner and we can’t wait to be back.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE,  DNF): “A tough race today. We were a bit out of strategy  trying to make up for some of the deficit we had in the pits. We were  pushing as hard as we could. Before the incident there were a few  prototypes behind me. I thought, one of them would be right behind me,  but he went into the pits. I left a bit too much space in the last  corner, got on the marbles and went off. I was just a passenger at  that point. Of course it’s very disappointing to end the M8 program  for our car on that note. I feel bad for the guys.”\n"}

The fastest qualifier of the 2021 MotoGP™ season is once  again Fabio Quartararo. The Frenchman, who wrapped up the world  championship title with races to spare in October, won this year’s  coveted BMW M Award, for the second season in a row. The award is an  integral component of BMW M’s activities as ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’  and was presented for the 19th time in 2021. The prize for the winner  is traditionally a high-performance car from BMW M – this year the new  BMW M5 (fuel consumption, combined: 11.3 – 11.1 l\/100 km [25.0 – 25.5  mpg imp] correspond to NEDC; 11.3 – 10.9 l\/100 km correspond to WLTP,  CO2 emissions, combined: 258 – 253 g\/km correspond to NEDC,  257 – 248 g\/km correspond to WLTP)* in Brands Hatch Grey Metallic. The  prize car was presented at the final race weekend of the season at  Valencia by Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH, and Carmelo  Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP™ rights holder Dorna Sports. Having won the BMW M Award for the first time in 2020, Quartararo was  unbeatable again in this special competition. The Frenchman secured  pole position five times this season on his way to winning his first  MotoGP™ World Championship title. In total, he amassed 318 points for  the BMW M Award standings and ended the season 15 points clear of his  closest rival. Quartararo received his new BMW M5 CS after the final qualifying of  the season on Saturday. The formal handover by Franciscus van Meel and  Carmelo Ezpeleta took place in the MotoGP™ VIP Village at Valencia’s  ‘Circuit Ricardo Tormo’. “The BMW M Award is of great significance to us. MotoGP is the  pinnacle of motorcycle racing and it is very important for us to  recognise the outstanding performances of the MotoGP riders over the  course of the season,” said van Meel. “Every race weekend, they thrill  us with breath-taking performances on the track. MotoGP brings  together the best motorcycle racers in the world – and the BMW M Award  is the fitting reward for the fastest of them all. For the second time  in a row, that person is Fabio Quartararo. He has once again shown his  skill and speed this season, deservedly winning the world  championship, and has also been in a class of his own again in the BMW  M Award. We are delighted to present him with the BMW M5 CS in  recognition of his qualifying performances. Congratulations, Fabio –  on the world championship title and winning the BMW M Award again. Our  23rd season as ‘Official Car of MotoGP’ draws to a close here at  Valencia, and we are now looking forward to 2022. It will be a special  year for us at BMW M, as we will be celebrating our 50th birthday –  and plans are already being made for an anniversary highlight in MotoGP.” “The BMW M Award has been an important part of MotoGP since 2003, and  the presentation ceremony on the Saturday afternoon of the season  finale is a nice tradition,” said Ezpeleta. “BMW M GmbH comes up with  something special every year when selecting the prize car. This shows  how much they value the performances of our riders, and how important  the partnership is with MotoGP. This was already the 23rd season  together in this long-term and close collaboration. In the BMW M5 CS,  BMW M GmbH has again provided a fantastic prize car. Congratulations  to our new world champion Fabio Quartararo on his second BMW M Award  in a row. He has once again thrilled us with his outstanding  performances this year. I am sure he will have a lot of fun with the  BMW M5 CS.” “It has been a fantastic season for me, winning my first MotoGP World  Championship, and my second BMW M Award is the icing on the cake at  the end of this special year,” said winner Quartararo. “I am delighted  to have won the BMW M Award again in 2021, having claimed my ‘maiden  victory’ last year. I really enjoy driving the BMW M2 CS from the 2020  BMW M Award, and I have to say that the new BMW M5 CS obviously caught  my eye as soon as it was presented as this year’s prize car. Even from  the outside, you can see how much power and performance it has. It is  fantastic that I have actually won it and can take it home with me.  Thank you very much to BMW M GmbH, who have been involved in MotoGP  for so many years, and who highlight and recognise our performances as  riders with the BMW M Award.” The BMW M5 CS is the new top-of-the-range, high-performance model  from BMW M and, with its 4.4-litre V8 engine generating 467 kW\/635 hp,  is the most powerful car in the company’s history. The new BMW M5 CS  sprints from 0 to 100 km\/h in just 3.0 seconds, and from 0 to 200 km\/h  in 10.3 seconds. The top speed is an electrically governed 305 km\/h.  The high-performance engine teams up with an eight-speed M Steptronic  transmission with Drivelogic and uses the M xDrive all-wheel-drive  system, which also offers a 2WD mode for pure rear-wheel drive, to  channel its power to the road. With the BMW M5 CS, BMW M GmbH has  focussed on consistently lightweight design, with many components made  from carbon-reinforced plastic (CFRP). Examples of this include the  bonnet, front splitter, exterior mirror caps, rear spoiler, rear  diffuser, M Power engine compartment cover and intake silencer. The  chassis has also been adapted to the weight of the car, which is  lighter than other M5 models, with retuned bearing springs at the  front and rear axle, and further refined damper control. Many details  of the new BMW M5 CS are a tribute to the close association between  BMW M GmbH and motorsport. The BMW M Award is an important pillar in BMW M GmbH’s involvement as  ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’. Since 2013, the fastest qualifier in  MotoGP™ has been recognised at the end of each season with an  exclusive high-performance car. The riders score points at each Grand  Prix weekend, based on their results in qualifying and using the same  points system as in the races themselves. The record winner of the BMW  M Award is Marc Márquez, who won the award seven times in a row.  Valentino Rossi and Casey Stoner both have three victories in the BMW  M Award to their name. Fabio Quartararo and Jorge Lorenzo have both  been honoured as the top qualifier on two occasions, while Sete  Gibernau and Nicky Hayden have received the award once. For more information about BMW M GmbH and the involvement as the  ‘Official Car of MotoGP™’, see: www.bmw-m.com\n"}

BMW    Team RLL, who have been celebrating successes with BMW M Motorsport    since 2009, will compete in the two LMDh prototypes as of 2023.    Initial sketches give a foretaste of the car, which will be called    BMW M LMDh. Alongside the LMDh test programme, BMW Team RLL will    field two BMW M4 GT3s in the new GTD Pro category in the 2022 IMSA season. “I’m delighted that our LMDh project has reached its next milestone  with the announcement of BMW Team RLL as the team to race in the two  prototypes,” said Franciscus van Meel, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “As with  chassis partner Dallara, in team principal Bobby Rahal and his crew we  have outstanding expertise and decades of experience at the highest  level on our side. The LMDh project continues to gain momentum and I  am confident that next year we will once again take all necessary  steps as planned to be as well prepared as possible for entering our  first IMSA season with the LMDh prototypes in 2023. We are taking on  this new challenge together at full speed.” Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport, added: “BMW Team RLL is the  ideal partner for our LMDh project. BMW M Motorsport has been working  very successfully with Bobby Rahal and his crew since 2009. During  this time, we have all come to know the IMSA series very well and have  celebrated major success together. From our perspective, racing in the  top class and challenging for overall victories from 2023 is the  logical next step. When you compete with a new race car, it is a great  advantage to already know what awaits you in the race series, at the  circuits, and in terms of organisation. This is 100 percent the case  in the constellation we have opted for. That also goes for BMW of  North America. Thank you very much for your fantastic support. Plus,  BMW Team RLL is not only one of the best teams in North America on the  GT scene, but also in Formula racing so we have all the right  ingredients for success.” BMW Team RLL has been contesting the GT category of the IMSA and its  predecessor series in BMW racing cars since 2009. This partnership’s  biggest successes have been the GTLM wins with the BMW M8 GTE at the  24 Hours of Daytona in 2019 and 2020, the GTLM title wins in the  driver, team and manufacturer standings of the 2020 Michelin Endurance  Cup, and a total of five GT titles with the BMW M3 GT in the 2010 and  2011 seasons of the American Le Mans Series. Bobby Rahal’s team also  enjoys success in the North American IndyCar Series. The team has won  the legendary Indy 500 twice – most recently in 2020. Alongside the  intensive testing with the BMW M LMDh, BMW Team RLL will contest the  2022 IMSA season starting with two BMW M4 GT3s in the newly  established GTD Pro category in the first races. “For me personally and professionally this is a dream come true”,  said Rahal. “Now to first run a brand-new car like the BMW M4 GT3 and  after that make the next step with BMW Team RLL to race for overall  wins in the LMDh class is a direction we definitely wanted to go. I’m  so pleased, so proud, so thankful that we’ll be able to do it together  with BMW M Motorsport.” The design sketches of the BMW M LMDh were produced in close  collaboration between BMW M Motorsport and BMW Group Designworks.  Michael Scully, BMW Group Designworks Global Automotive Director,  said: “Uniting the iconic elements of BMW M Motorsport design DNA with  the performant architecture of an ultra-modern prototype is what this  project is all about. The shape of the BMW M LMDh exemplifies the  visceral efficiency which is so synonymous with BMW M Motorsport, yet  the design process has been highly collaborative between BMW M  Motorsport, Dallara, and BMW Group Designworks. Iterating the exterior  surfaces with this team is particularly rewarding because each project  partner has distinguished expertise in their discipline, yet there’s a  mutual respect and drive to find a transcendent, cohesive result  together.  I’m confident this car will be something we can all be  proud of, and that the on-track results will reflect the development  team’s great dynamic. For me personally this project represents the  synthesis of my professional design experience and a life-long  immersion in prototype racing at lower echelons as a driver. It’s  indeed a dream realized.”  Note to editors:A new episode of the video series “MBEDDED” will be released on the  BMW Motorsport YouTube channel, which will be all about the renewal of  the partnership with BMW Team RLL in the context of MOTUL Petit Le  Mans.

{"prompt":"A visit to the Spree metropolis always has a very special charm. Sightseeing doesn't necessarily require the irrepressible power of the MINI John Cooper Works GP. But with its compact dimensions, agile handling and unmistakable appearance, the fastest MINI ever is ideally suited for city traffic between Glienicke Bridge and the Brandenburger Tor. ->","completion":" Munich. The atmosphere crackles - something is in the  air of Berlin. On the Glienicke Bridge, passers-by are amazed. Agent  exchange? No, there was something like that before, actually, only  three times between 1962 and 1986. Now it is the MINI John Cooper  Works GP (fuel consumption combined: 7.3 l\/100 km; CO2 emissions  combined: 167 g\/km according to WLTP) that catches the eye. The  fastest MINI ever built is also rarely seen. The 225 kW\/306 hp model  was built in a small series of only 3000 units.The MINI John Cooper Works GP is actually too spirited for city  traffic. But its agile handling characteristics and compact dimensions  are extremely helpful in the hustle of the metropolis with its almost  four million inhabitants. And the impressive charisma, which is  provided by wheel arch trims made of carbon, a roof spoiler with  double-wing contour, 18-inch lightweight forged wheels and a  model-specific suspension with vehicle lowering, fits perfectly into  the image of a city where big appearances play a big role.The most modern top sports car in the model range of the traditional  British brand approaches the capital from the south-west, where  history and modernity merge in a unique way. And this already begins  on the Glienicke Bridge, which has been still a simple wooden bridge  350 years ago. But due to the growing volume of traffic it became part  of one of the most important connecting routes between the residential  cities of Berlin and Potsdam. Today, the route leads via Königsstraße  to the city motorway 115 through Grunewald. This is where the  \"Automobile Traffic and Practice Road\" was opened 100 years  ago. In its original layout of around 19 kilometres, the AVUS  connected today's exhibition grounds near the Charlottenburg district  and Nikolassee near Zehlendorf with two straights and a north and a  south curve.Race track operations were discontinued in 1998, and the striking  administration building on Messedamm and the 200-metre-long spectator  grandstand are listed buildings now. Today the MINI John Cooper Works  GP brings back a little racing feeling. Its four-cylinder turbo engine  accelerates it from a standstill to 100 km\/h in 5.2 seconds. The  precisely controllable sports brake system with four-piston fixed  calliper disc brakes on the front wheels guarantees equally dynamic  deceleration maneuvers. In fast bends, the aerodynamically optimised  design features ensure reduced lift, while a top speed of 265 km\/h is  possible on long straights. In theory, anyway, because today the speed  limit on the AVUS is 100 km\/h.On the Teufelsberg, which is very close to the former Nordkurve,  visitors have a great view over the Grunewald and Berlin - no wonder,  at 120.1 metres, the Teufelsberg is the second highest elevation in  the city. Contemporary spray art can also be admired there. Hundreds  of small and large murals have been created on the walls of a former  radar station over the past decades.After a brief stop at the Olympic Stadium, the MINI John Cooper Works  GP heads for the Mitte district. On Bundesstraße 2, the 67-metre-high  Victory Column soon comes into view. The MINI circles the \"Großer  Stern\" (Great Star) once (or twice or three times?), as the  partially five-lane roundabout is called, and then along the “Straße  des 17. Juni” right in front of the Brandenburger Tor. Turn right  once, and after just a few hundred metres the two-seater becomes an  eye-catcher at Potsdamer Platz. Europe's first traffic lights were  located there in 1924. At that time, this intersection was one of the  busiest places in the old world. The contrast was all the greatest  when Potsdamer Platz became a no-man's land after the Second World War  as a place between the American and Soviet occupation zones. After the  fall of the Berlin Wall, however, the historic square quickly became a  vibrant hotspot again.From modern Potsdamer Platz, the path leads to the Kreuzberg district  and there to a historic shopping opportunity. Market Hall 9 on  Eisenbahnstraße was opened 130 years ago. There was space for 300  stalls, each four square metres in size, to supply the people with  fresh goods. It is one of 14 Berlin market halls that were built in  the second half of the 19th century. Today, \"shopping  differently\" and \"eating differently\" are now taking  part. Traders and customers value seasonal products and regional sources.From Kreuzberg, all it takes is a short hop across the Spree or a  brisk ride over the Oberbaum Bridge to reach one of Berlin's most  visited tourist spots, the East Side Gallery. It was opened in  September 1990 and comprises the longest remaining section of the  Berlin Wall. 118 artists from 21 countries created the world's longest  open-air gallery on 1.3 kilometres of the former border after the fall  of the Wall.If you now follow the Spree, you will arrive at Alexanderplatz and  from there via the magnificent boulevard “Unter den Linden”, past the  TV Tower, the Berlin Cathedral, the Gendarmenmarkt and the Humboldt  Forum in the rebuilt City Palace directly into the government  district. History and the present are very close together here between  the Reichstag building, the main railway station, the Chancellery and  Bellevue Palace, the seat of the Federal President.On the way through Charlottenburg and to the International Congress  Centre (ICC), the driver of the MINI John Cooper Works GP has to  decide. Either he takes another trip over the AVUS into the Grunewald  and over the Glienicke Bridge to Potsdam, or he heads north into the  green countryside surrounding Berlin. The choice falls on the  excursion to the Mecklenburg Seenland. Because in the middle of the  Schorfheide, the MINI John Cooper Works GP can once again demonstrate  what it's made of. Europe's largest driving safety centre has existed  in Groß Dölln since 2002. The area includes not only a unique handling  course, but also a 4.25-kilometre race track.On this terrain, you can experience just how much the developers of  the MINI John Cooper Works GP have used their racing know-how to  create extreme driving pleasure. A particularly tight engine mount,  the rigid body structure, the differential lock integrated into the  8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission and the model-specific  high-performance tyres enable a fascinatingly spontaneous development  of power when sprinting from a standstill and accelerating out of  bends. The no less impressive lateral acceleration results, among  other things, from a wide track and model-specific increased camber  values for the front and rear wheels. In GP Mode, the intervention  thresholds of the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) system are also  raised. This gives the driver a little more leeway when approaching  the limits. GP Mode can be activated quite simply with a toggle  switch. And once again there is a certain crackle in the air. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product Communications MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communications MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the    BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles    and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility    services.

{"prompt":"This Saturday marks the end of an era. After four successful years, the BMW M8 GTE will contest its final race at the MOTUL Petit Le Mans endurance classic at Road Atlanta (USA).  ->","completion":" Munich. This Saturday marks the end of an era. After four    successful years, the BMW M8 GTE will contest its final race at the    MOTUL Petit Le Mans endurance classic at Road Atlanta (USA). BMW    Team RLL has competed with the BMW M8 GTE in the North American IMSA    WeatherTech SportsCar Championship since 2018. During these four    years, the team has claimed five wins and a total of 25 podium    finishes with the car. The undisputed highlights were the two    back-to-back GTLM victories at the 24 Hours of Daytona (USA) in 2019    and 2020. They also won the Driver, Team and Manufacturer titles in    the GTLM class in last year’s IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup. And so it is time for the farewell performance. BMW Team RLL will  once again run two MOTUL BMW M8 GTEs in the ten-hour MOTUL Petit Le  Mans race on Saturday 13th November. The #24 car will be co-driven by  John Edwards (USA), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). Their  team-mates Connor De Phillippi (USA), Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp  Eng (AUT) will alternate at the wheel of the #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE. The  MOTUL Petit Le Mans is the fourth and final endurance race of the 2021  IMSA season. The title defence in the IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup is  still possible in the Driver, Team and Manufacturer competitions. In  preparation for the race, BMW Team RLL attended two successful tests  at Road Atlanta. Turner Motorsport runs the BMW M6 GT3 in the GTD class again. The  team celebrated the Petit Le Mans GTD victory in 2019. This coming  weekend, the the #96 BMW M6 GT3 will be co-driven by racing legend,  BMW institution and IMSA record winner Bill Auberlen (USA), Robby  Foley (USA) and Aidan Read (AUS). Turner Motorsport competes in the final race of this season’s IMSA  Michelin Pilot Challenge on Friday 12th November. Auberlen  and his team-mate Dillon Machavern (USA) lead the GS class in the #95  BMW M4 GT4 going into the season finale. Foley shares the cockpit of  the #96 BMW M4 GT4 with Vincent Barletta (USA). They currently lie  third in the GS class. Farewell, and welcome to the future.The farewell appearance of the BMW M8 GTE also marks the start of the  future. The new BMW M4 GT3, which will take to the track all over the  world as BMW M Motorsport’s new GT flagship from 2022, will be on  display in the Fan Zone at the racetrack during the weekend. Quotes ahead of the MOTUL Petit Le Mans: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “Our  racing programme with the BMW M8 GTE certainly was a great project for  us. Winning the 24 Hours of Daytona not once, but twice has to be the  highlight. And to be able to win it two years in a row is a tremendous  comment about the BMW M8 GTE. We’ve had a lot of really good races  with it. The M8 has been a fabulous car for us to race and it was  really well done in terms of the design of it to begin with which I  think is why it has been successful. All in all we have to look back  fondly at our program history with the BMW M8 GTE and would like to  end on a high note with victory at Petit Le Mans.”   John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “It’s been a long break for us since Watkins Glen, so  I’m itching to get back to racing! Last year’s Petit Le Mans proved  the BMW M8 GTE was quick at Road Atlanta, but we sadly watched the win  slip through our fingers in the last half hour after a prototype  shoved Augusto off. This year we have a little extra motivation to  take what was ours last year and end the final race for the BMW M8 GTE  with a win! The M8 has given us some great performances over the  years, but by far my most memorable race with the car will always be  the 2020 Rolex 24 at Daytona, specifically my triple stint Sunday  morning. The Porsches had proved to be quick in the night, but as the  track temp started rising with the sun shining on it, our M8 came  alive. I had a great battle with one of the Porsches, almost touching  at 180mph as we fought for the lead. It was the most mentally  exhausting stint I’ve driven in a race and the stakes were as high as  they could get! We pulled off the win that day to give the BMW M8 GTE  its second Daytona win in a row and proved that 2019 was no fluke. We  will miss the M8!” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “Road Atlanta has been a good place for us in the last  couple of years. We were really close to winning the race last year so  we know the car can do it as long as we execute a clean race. It will  be the last race for the BMW M8 GTE so I will try to enjoy every  moment of it, and it would be awesome to send the car to retirement  with one last win. It has been a privilege to have been a part of the  GTLM project with the BMW M8 GTE for the past four years with BMW Team  RLL and I have a lot of memories which I will cherish forever. The  most important being the win at the 2020 Daytona 24h and being the  driver bringing it home and passing the checkered flag after 24h of  close racing. The car is a beast, and I will for sure miss driving it.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “This will be a very emotional race for all of us as it  is the end of the BMW M8 GTE era. Of course, we would all like to  finish with the car as high on the podium as we can. Last year, we led  until the last few minutes, finishing third after getting pushed off  the circuit. Most importantly, I want to thank BMW for the opportunity  to race such a wonderful car in a great series.” Bruno Spengler (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE):  “Road Atlanta has suited the BMW M8 GTE in past races so hopefully we  will be in a position to fight for a good finish for the car’s final  race. In fact, my best memory of the car is winning the six-hour race  at the track with Connor in 2020. GTE has been a special category. The  cars are great to drive with super tyres and no ABS. It reminded me a  bit of a DTM car – with less downforce.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “Petit will be the final send off for our BMW M8 GTE  and I know she is ready to go out in style. We had two great test days  and the team came very close to winning the race last year. Road  Atlanta suits the car well and I know if we run a mistake free race,  we should have a shot to fight for a win one last time. The M8 program  will forever have a special place in my heart since it was my first  factory effort with BMW. The most memorable win together was  definitely the Rolex 24 at Daytona in 2019. It was a very emotional  win for not only BMW as a brand but also for myself with my family in  attendance to see such a pinnacle moment in my career. It has been  four fantastic years with highs and lows, but it has been some of the  most fun I’ve had in motorsport. I will miss the GTLM era greatly, but  I believe the future of our motorsport programmes is very bright.” Philipp Eng (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE):  “Petit Le Mans is one of my season highlights; the track is one of the  best worldwide. We have been testing at Road Atlanta and were pushing  the car forward. I would really wish that we can have a double victory  at Petit Le Mans and focus on winning the Michelin Endurance Cup. BMW  Team RLL and everyone involved would really deserve this success.”\n"}
{"prompt":"Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you a regular overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. ->","completion":" ADAC GT4 Germany: Schrey\/Piana win the title in the BMW M4 GT4.Michael Schrey (GER) and Gabriele Piana (ITA) did it. The Team Hofor  Racing by Bonk Motorsport duo won the drivers’ title in ADAC GT4  Germany. Schrey and Piana took a total of five season wins overall in  their BMW M4 GT4, with four of those coming in the first four races,  paving the way for the later title win. The two experienced drivers  ended the season with a lead of eleven points, despite suffering  setbacks at the final weekend, held at the Nürburgring (GER). After  retiring on Saturday after a pit stop error, they finished in P20 on  Sunday. On a drying track, the team followed the same tyre strategy as  their rivals in the overall standings and opted for wet-weather tyres.  This ultimately wrong decision saw both contenders for the title drop  right down the field. “The tyre choice was the best wrong decision I have ever made,” said  Schrey. “I still can’t believe it. After it being so close last year,  lots of people in the paddock are pleased for us that we won this  title. Gabriele is a very fast racing driver and uses his head. We  work together flawlessly as a team and trust each other 100 percent.  And Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport delivered another incredible  performance in 2021. It’s these factors that tipped the scales in  favour of us winning the championship. Now we are over the moon.” Piana added: “We knew that slicks would have been the right decision  but we wanted to be in the same position as the Zakspeed Mercedes-AMG  and play it safe. Now it is hard to put just how happy we are into  words. To finally win the title in the ADAC GT4 Germany after  finishing in second place two years in a row in 2019 and 2020 is fantastic.” Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport finished in second place in the team standings. ADAC GT Masters: Schubert Motorsport ends the season with two    top-ten results.Nick Yelloly (GBR) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) ended the ADAC GT Masters  season with two top-ten results in the BMW M6 GT3 fielded by Schubert  Motorsport. The duo moved up the field well in both races at the  Nürburgring (GER). On Saturday, they started from twelfth on the grid  and worked their way up into P9, and Yelloly and Krohn made up even  more ground on Sunday, starting from 18th on the grid and  crossing the finish line in P8. They finish the season in eighth place  in the overall standings, after three podium finishes. The highlight  being the second place at Schubert Motorsport’s home event in Oschersleben. Italian GT Championship: Endurance final at Monza.The racetrack in the royal park of Monza (ITA) hosted the finale of  the 2021 Italian GT Championship on the last weekend in October.  Another three-hour endurance race brought the season to a close. The  #7 BMW M6 GT3 of BMW Team Italia was shared by Stefano Comandini  (ITA), Marius Zug (GER) and Bruno Spengler (CAN) once again. The trio  finished the final endurance race of the year in fifth place. Their  team-mates Nicola Neri, Giuseppe Fascicolo (both ITA) and Alfred  Nilsson (SWE) secured another class win with the #215 BMW M4 GT4 in  the GT4 category, and also won the season’s standings in this class. Super GT Championship: BMW Team Studie in action at Motegi.The penultimate race weekend of the Japanese Super GT Championship  season was held at the Twin Ring Motegi (JPN). BMW Team Studie with  Seiji Ara and Tomohide Yamaguchi (both JPN) at the wheel of the BMW M6  GT3 finished in P15 in the GT300 category. The season finale will be  held at Fuji (JPN) on the last weekend in November, when BMW Team  Studie will have the honour of contesting the BMW M6 GT3’s final race  before it is replaced by the new BMW M4 GT3 next year. BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux: Stienes Longin crowned champion.The first BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux champion is Stienes Longin  (NED). The PK Carsport driver clinched the title at the season finale  at Assen (NED) at the end of October. Longin had already secured the  crown on the final Saturday after winning the first of the weekend’s  three races. His team-mate Peter Guelinckx (BEL) won the title in the  AM class. The duo shared the car in the third, longer race and ended  the season with another podium finish. The title in the Pro-Am  classification went to Steven Brams (BEL). 2021 marked the inaugural season of the BMW M2 CS Racing Cup Benelux.

{"prompt":"Unique, different and yet completely BMW R 18 - that’s \"The Wal\", the latest creation by Japanese customizer Shinya Kimura.  ->","completion":" Munich. Unique, different and yet completely BMW R 18  - that’s\"The Wal\", the latest creation by Japanese  customizer Shinya Kimura. After Roland Sands and Dirk Oehlerking,  Kimura is the third customizer to transform the R 18 into an  extraordinary unique specimen for the \"SoulFuel\" series.  \"SoulFuel\" is a collaboration between BMW Motorrad and  selected customizers.Until recently, Shinya Kimura worked mainly on older  motorcycles, but the Japanese customizer is increasingly also devoting  himself to projects involving modern bikes.\"The Wal\" is one of them. “The basis is the R 18,  powered by the latest and greatest engine I have ever worked on. It  all started with a visit to the BMW Motorrad R 18 development team in  Germany. I got to know the unbounded passion and innovative power that  prevails at BMW Motorrad. Finally, in February 2021 in California, I  rode the standard R 18 for a few hundred kilometres to get to know the  character of the bike. Following a whole series of conversations, this  eventually led to my personal interpretation of the R 18, in which I  applied the entire range of my activities as a customizer,\" says  Shinya Kimura, recounting the initial phase of \"The Wal\"  project.Kimura then began work in mid-February and \"The  Wal\" was already built up by the end of June. \"But there  were still some mechanical problems that kept me busy for another two  weeks,\" Kimura continues.Kimura’s motorcycles are created exclusively “hands-on”Shinya Kimura's craftsmanship can be aptly described by the term  \"hands-on\", as there are no sketches, drawings, blueprints  or mock-ups during the building process. But there is a precise idea  of what the customer, or in this case the customizer, wants.\"I built the R 18 entirely for myself. When I rode the  production R 18, I thought it might suit my build and riding  preferences better if I designed it to be a little more front-facing  with a fairing. I decided to adopt the frame, wheels and tyres as well  as suspension elements and brakes because I didn't feel the need to  change them after I had ridden the bike. I also wanted to be able to  ride for long distances with my R 18 while feeling and enjoying the  legendary boxer engine. It was very important to me to preserve the  two characters of the R 18 as I experienced them when riding. Thanks  to its mighty engine, the bike is wild and has almost inexhaustible  power on the one hand, yet it is completely good-natured on the other.  Just like a whale, hence the German animal name for this R 18, which  for me is something like a \"Sports Endurancer\",\" Kimura explains.The \"Sports Endurancer\" is unmistakably evident in  Kimura's R 18 \"The Wal\". This is ensured by a larger and,  completely differently designed fuel tank compared to the original, an  elongated, harmoniously rounded seat hump and a half-shell fairing.\"I also moved the foot rests back about two inches to have  more flexibility for positioning the legs. At the same time, I lowered  the handlebars and changed the seat to my liking. The seat cushion was  also designed by me and then handmade by BACKDROP Leathers in Japan.  It all added up to the very natural posture that I like,\" Kimura continues.The semi-shell fairing houses two asymmetrically arranged  headlights that almost look like eyes and, with a little imagination,  actually give Kimura's R 18 the appearance of a whale together with a  \"set of teeth\" incorporated underneath. The colour scheme  and the coarsely textured paintwork also match the theme of \"The  Wal\". In short: \"The Wal\" R 18 is an “animal” of a  bike. Powerful, mighty, but always good-natured.\"What I like best about my version of the R 18 is that I  was able to change the style and seating position to my liking without  destroying the excellent original functionality of the R 18. But  drastically changing the seating position and adding my own style and  taste was a big challenge in my interpretation of the BMW Heritage.  Besides, all these computerised systems and wiring were quite new to  me and I learned a lot,\" says Kimura, pleased with the result of  his work.Hard facts about the R 18 customising project \"The Wal\":The King of Customizing: Shinya Kimura.Born and raised in a family that ran a small rivet factory in  downtown Tokyo, Shinya Kimura was always surrounded by the smell of  steel and oil and the sound of machinery and metals. Perhaps that's  why, after studying entomology, Kimura decided to return to what felt  most natural to him: tinkering in his workshop and building things  from different metals.Kimura, the father of the so-called \"Zero Style\"  motorbike, began his career as a customizer in Japan at Zero  Engineering, a company he founded in 1992. He rose to international  fame as early as the 1990s, when his custom Harley-Davidson  \"Samurai Chopper\" was created. It followed his  characteristic wabi-sabi influenced style.In search of new inspiration, Kimura later moved to Azusa,  California, where he founded his own independent company, Chabott  Engineering, in 2006. Today, the sought-after customizer only makes a  handful of motorcycles a year - exclusively for customers with whom he  feels a mutual understanding and no time pressure. The great passion  that drives him: \"Passion for all the motorbikes that were born  into this world\", as he says himself. While working on \"The  Wal\" project, he discovered new things every day that stimulated  and motivated him. Looking back, he says: \"I greatly appreciate  BMW Motorrad and all the people who supported me in this project. It  was such a valuable and impactful experience for me.\"Disclaimer.The vehicles shown may be modified  and fitted with third-party accessories and\/or proprietary parts that  are not manufactured, distributed or tested by BMW.

{"prompt":" Oliver Zipse gives keynote speech at Sustainable Innovation Forum  Holistic and effective approach to reducing CO2 emissions  Circular economy will be key  ->","completion":" Munich\/Glasgow. It is a commitment born of tradition  and responsibility: The BMW Group has attended every UN climate summit  since 2008. At this year's COP 26 in Glasgow, the company once again  sees itself as a provider of innovative mobility solutions in the  fight against climate change. The BMW Group brought along the BMW i  Vision Circular, produced from 100% secondary materials, as a clear  statement of its ambitions. The company is also actively engaging in  dialogue with stakeholders and partners in Glasgow, discussing both  unresolved issues and a range of possible solutions. BMW Group as a partner of the Sustainable Innovation ForumThe BMW Group has been a partner of the Sustainable Innovation Forum  (SIF) since the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015. The SIF  is one of the most important economic forums within the COP framework,  bringing together representatives from the political sector, cities,  NGOs, the financial world and industry. For the first time, Chairman  of the Board of Management of BMW AG Oliver Zipse will give the  keynote speech for the three-day event in Glasgow this year, setting  clear priorities: “The key to sustainability lies in innovation: in  innovative technologies, but also in innovative thinking that accepts  no boundaries. Most importantly, together we must choose and follow a  binding path with clear goals. Always according to the motto: No more  waiting. No more clever tactics. It’s time to act. Now.” BMW Group commits to goal of total climate neutrality by 2050Every gram of CO2 counts – no matter where it is emitted. All  available technologies for reduction must be utilised. The BMW Group  has set itself a firm and verifiable interim goal for 2030 throughout  its entire value chain: to reduce CO2 emissions from its vehicles by  at least 40% – starting with the raw material, through the supply  chain, production and the use phase, all the way to recycling. Public  verifiability of this reduction takes place through the Integrated BMW  Group Report, which documents sustainable development indicators with  equal weighting as key business figures. The BMW Group is also a  member of the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) and signed the    “Business Ambition for 1.5°C” pledge ahead of COP 26. This  is an important step, in line with the most ambitious objective of the  Paris Climate Agreement and commits the company to the goal of total  climate neutrality by 2050. By 2030, over 50% of sales fully electric – MINI and    Rolls-Royce all-electric in ten yearsThe BMW Group released the first electric car produced in Germany on  a large scale, the BMW i3, back in 2013. By 2030, more than 50% of its  annual vehicle sales will be fully electric. Furthermore, its two  British brands, Rolls-Royce and MINI, will be exclusively all-electric  from the early 2030s onwards. In this connection, Oliver Zipse  underlined the importance of building infrastructure at the same time:  “Ramping up electromobility is the single most important factor on the  road to climate-neutral mobility. But even in industrialised  countries, there is still one major obstacle: the lack of infrastructure.” Circular economy: The purest form of Sheer Driving PleasureAnother focal point for the BMW Group is the circular economy: Humans  consume more than 100 billion tonnes of raw materials every year – and  that number is rising. In addition, processing of many primary raw  materials is extremely energy-intensive and therefore also  carbon-intensive. That is why the BMW Group is pursuing the vision of  a circular economy, with the aim of keeping raw materials in the cycle  for as long as possible. The BMW i Vision Circular is in Glasgow as  both an exhibit and to spark debate. It demonstrates in very tangible  form, how a vehicle can be produced using 100% secondary materials –  and where the challenges lie. BMW Group Dialogue 2021 – realising change together with partnersThe BMW Group already held a stakeholder dialogue on the subject of  the circular economy in Glasgow on 7 November. BMW Group vehicles  currently average around 30% secondary materials. Going forward, the  company aims to increase this amount to 50%. The BMW Group discussed  how this can be achieved and what hurdles need to be overcome with  around 25 high-level international stakeholders at its dialogue event.  Alongside the BMW Group’s Vice President Sustainability and Mobility,  Dr Thomas Becker, renowned Cradle-to-Cradle pioneer Prof. Michael  Braungart also served as a catalyst for discussion.  If you have any questions, please contact: Corporate Communications Andreas Klugescheid, Head Governmental Affairs Europe, Middle East  and AfricaEmail: andreas.klugescheid@bmw.de, Telephone: +49-89-382-23661 Marc Sauber, Spokesperson Sustainability CommunicationsEmail: marc.sauber@bmw.de,  Telephone: +49 89 382-52322 Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.com\/deutschlandEmail: presse@bmwgroup.com  The BMW Group With its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

{"prompt":"Statement Dr Peter Conference Call Q3 2021.  ->","completion":" Good Morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. The BMW Group’s positive business development in the first nine  months of the year confirms our strategic course. Throughout the semiconductor crisis, our employees have delivered  outstanding performance, month after month. That is how we were able  to raise our expected targets for the year again in September. All segments are on track to meet our guidance for the year. We  continue to focus on gearing the BMW Group towards emission-free  mobility – funding the investments needed from our ongoing business. We will keep our Performance Programme going, with a main focus on  the consistent exploitation of market potential. Moreover, we are picking up the pace in the digitalisation of  processes across the entire company. And we will continue to work  consistently on the optimisation of our working capital, in particular  on our logistics. Let's start with the financial figures for the Group.Group revenues for the first three quarters of 2021 climbed by 19.2%  to 82.83 billion euros. Third-quarter revenues increased to 27.47  billion euros. As expected, Group earnings before tax for the year to the end of  September were significantly higher than the previous year, at 13.15  billion euros. The figure for the third quarter was 3.42 billion  euros. The Group EBT margin for the year to the end of September was  15.9%; in the third quarter, it was 12.4%. We therefore can be confident that we will not only achieve  significantly higher Group earnings for the year, as previously  announced, but also surpass our long-term target of at least 10% for  Group EBT margin. After a strong first half-year, third-quarter vehicle sales were, as  expected, lower than the prior-year quarter – due in part to the  ongoing semiconductor supply bottlenecks. Strong customer demand is reflected in continuing positive pricing  effects, while the model mix has also continued to improve. Sustained high prices on international preowned car markets also  resulted in very favourable income levels from the resale of  end-of-lease vehicles in the third quarter. This has enabled us to  more than offset the decrease in volumes. Ladies and Gentlemen,With the market launch of the two all-electric iX and i4 models in  November, we reached another major milestone. New orders for both  vehicles are very strong. We continue to push forward with the electrification of our entire  model range, as planned. As previously announced, we are also making  further investments in digitisation.This will be a particular focus for us this year and in 2022, with  respect to both our vehicles and our processes. By the end of the year, the BMW Group will have the largest fleet  capable of over-the-air upgrades among the competition with around 2.5  million vehicles. Also as previously announced, research and development spending for  the third quarter was up almost 200 million euros on the previous  year, at 1.6 billion euros. This was also higher than the preceding quarters. The R&D ratio increased to 6.5% for the quarter and 5.3% for the  first nine months of the year. We continue to expect the R&D ratio  for the full year to be on a par with the previous year, at about 6%. At around 950 million euros, capital expenditure is also higher than  the previous year’s quarter, as planned. This represents a capex ratio  of 3.5% for the third quarter and 3.2% for the year to the end of  September. We still expect the ratio for the full year to be well  below our target figure of 5%. Through the overall positive market development, the BBA result in  the financial result continued to improve in the third quarter. Ladies and Gentlemen,Let's move on to the individual segments, starting with the  Automotive Segment. As expected, semiconductor supply bottlenecks slowed down sales in  the third quarter. However, thanks to our ability to respond quickly  and the high level of flexibility in our global production system, we  were able to limit the impact on vehicle manufacturing. In line with strong customer demand, revenues increased to more than  70 billion euros in the year to the end of September. Third-quarter  revenues totalled 22.63 billion euros, around 3% more than the  previous year. The segment also achieved a new all-time high, with an EBIT of 7.95  billion euros at the end of September. Despite the decrease in volumes  due to the supply bottlenecks, EBIT for the third quarter rose by  nearly 19% to 1.76 billion euros. This represents an EBIT margin of 11.3% for the year to the end of  September and 7.8% for the quarter. As expected, the earnings momentum weakened at the start of the  second half of the year, compared with the first half-year. In addition to the semiconductor issues, increased raw material  prices and higher fixed costs due to the growth in research and  development spending also had an impact on earnings. However, this was  offset by positive pricing effects resulting from supply shortages and  the positive trend in residual values. This development is also reflected in the contribution of our Chinese  joint venture, BBA, to the financial result. The total third-quarter  at-equity result was 35 million euros higher than the previous year. The strong earnings momentum and consistent ongoing management of  inventory levels are also evident in the segment’s free cash flow. At the end of September, free cash flow totalled almost 6.3 billion  euros – despite higher capital expenditure, scheduled cash outflows  for personnel restructuring measures and payment of the fine imposed  by the European Commission in connection with its antitrust proceedings. This means we are on course to meet our upwardly adjusted target for  2021 of around 6.5 billion euros. We anticipate a further increase in capital expenditure in the fourth  quarter, as well as significantly higher advance tax payments. Due to  the supply bottlenecks I mentioned, earnings development will also  weaken slightly compared to the first nine months of the year. The Financial Services Segment once again delivered a strong  performance. More than 1.5 million new financing and leasing contracts  were concluded with retail customers in the year to the end of  September. This means the number of new contracts is also higher than  in 2019, before the pandemic. Between January and September, segment earnings before tax climbed by  nearly 1.9 billion euros to more than 2.9 billion euros.The figure for the third quarter increased to 988 million euros. A key factor in this development remains the exceptionally positive  trend in preowned vehicle markets worldwide – leading to higher income  from the resale of end-of-lease vehicles. Expenses for credit risks  also remain low. In the prior year, we adjusted risk provisioning for  the pandemic – which had a dampening effect on segment earnings. The Motorcycles Segment also performed well in the first nine months  of the year. More than 156,000 motorcycles were delivered to customers  in the year to the end of September – a fifth more than in the same  period of 2020. The segment’s operating earnings almost tripled to 323 million euros.  The figure for the third quarter was 39 million euros. This represents  an EBIT margin of 14.3% for the first nine months and 6.1% for the quarter. Ladies and Gentlemen,Let's move on now to the outlook for our key financial and  non-financial performance indicators. We expect to see a significant increase in Group pre-tax earnings for  the full year. The number of employees is projected to be slightly lower than last year. In the Automotive Segment, we are forecasting a solid increase in the  number of vehicles delivered to customers, compared to the previous year. Electrified vehicles will account for a significantly higher  percentage of total volumes. By the end of September, we had already  sold more than twice as many battery-electric vehicles than in the  previous year. We will once again significantly reduce the CO₂ emissions of our new  vehicle fleet. However, the current uncertainty over semiconductor supplies will  continue to disrupt production in the fourth quarter. As previously  announced, high raw material prices and the increase in fixed costs  towards the end of the year will also impact earnings. We expect the EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment to be within the  range of 9.5 to 10.5%, as previously communicated. The main reason for the positive adjustment of our guidance in  September was continued positive pricing – for both new and preowned vehicles. In the Financial Services Segment, we expect a return on equity of  between 20 and 23%, in line with strong business development and the  positive residual value and credit risk situation. In the Motorcycles Segment, we anticipate a significant increase in  deliveries. The EBIT margin will remain within our target range of 8  to 10%. Our guidance assumes that political and economic conditions will not  deteriorate significantly. Ladies and Gentlemen,As previously announced, we expect a stable earnings development in  the fourth quarter. Customer demand will remain strong. However, the semiconductor supply bottlenecks will still be the main  influencing factor. Our strong performance in the first nine months of the year once  again proves our operating strength. At the same time, we continue to  focus on the further technological development of our products.  That is why we will enter the new year with full confidence. Thank you.\n"}

{"prompt":" Seamless integration into the production process  BMW Group draws on front-wheel-drive expertise of Plant Leipzig  Dynamic styling, re-designed interior, state-of-the-art connectivity   ->","completion":" Leipzig. BMW Group Plant Leipzig is launching series  production of the second generation of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer.  Having first reached dealerships almost seven years ago, in the autumn  of 2014, the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer was quick to establish itself  in the market. More than 400,000 customers have since opted to buy the  premium compact, which combines functional spaciousness with a dynamic  drive concept. More than 368,000 of the vehicles concerned were  manufactured in Leipzig. The successor of the sporty all-rounder will  be made in Leipzig only.“After the successful debut of the first-generation BMW 2 Series  Active Tourer, BMW Group Plant Leipzig is proud to produce its  completely redesigned successor,” emphasised Plant Director Hans-Peter  Kemser. “This vehicle is another opportunity for us to prove our  wealth of experience and expertise in the manufacture of front-wheel  drives in the BMW production network. The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer  will also keep our plant running at capacity over the longer term.”The key characteristics of the latest model generation are its  extremely dynamic styling, clear design language and redesigned  interior. In addition, the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer takes mild  hybrid technology into the compact class for the very first time,  along with the latest connectivity features and extended equipment packages.BMW 2 Series Active Tourer sets new standardsMaking its debut back in 2014, the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer caused  a revolution in the BMW product portfolio. Not only did it establish  the Sports Activity Tourer segment, it was also the first front-wheel  drive BMW. With its functional space concept, three-cylinder engines –  a first for BMW at the time – and cutting-edge front-wheel drive, the  newcomer offered all the dynamism of a BMW and heralded a new era for  the brand.The second-generation BMW 2 Series Active Tourer sets standards once  again. A pioneer, it paves the way for the forthcoming BMW and MINI  models joining the compact segment over the coming years. Aspects such  as the enhancements to the drivetrain and cockpit, and the new onboard  network – now found in petrol and diesel-powered BMW 2 Series Active  Tourer – all set new standards.Seamless integration into production processesRenowned for its extreme flexibility, Plant Leipzig had previously  been entrusted with the manufacture of the BMW Group’s first  electrified models – the BMW i3 and BMW i8. It is now the plant of  choice once again, for the launch of this new vehicle concept. Despite  the new requirements, only minor adjustments had to be made to the  paintshop and assembly systems, and the only new production area was  introduced into the bodyshop.The second generation of the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer has now been  integrated into production just as seamlessly and will roll off  Leipzig’s production lines along with the BMW 1 Series and BMW 2  Series Gran Coupe.Dynamic design and updated interiorIn terms of exterior design, the new BMW 2 Series Active Tourer now  exudes even more sportiness and self-assurance, thanks to its  dynamically elongated proportions and the clear, reduced treatment of  its surfaces.Inside, it offers a completely new sense of space. The interior has  been fully redesigned, taking its cues from the fully electric  technology flagship, the BMW iX. Particularly striking are the BMW  Curved Display, the ‘floating’ armrest with its integrated control  panel, and the slim instrument panel. Thanks to these features, the  BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is the first non-electric BMW to have the  cockpit layout of an electric one.Another first in the latest BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is the new BMW  iDrive, which makes its debut appearance in the premium compact  segment. The latest generation of the iDrive control system is based  on BMW Operating System 8.The second-generation BMW 2 Series Active Tourer designed to  accommodate combustion engines as well as electrified drive systems,  and just a few months after market launch in summer 2022, two plug-in  hybrids will be added to the range.The BMW 2 Series Active Tourer is due for market launch in Germany on  26 February 2022.\n"}
{"prompt":"The new K 1600 models: Six-cylinder fascination for dynamic and luxurious riding, touring and cruising.  ->","completion":" The new K 1600 models: Six-cylinder fascination for dynamic    and luxurious riding, touring and cruising.Six-cylinder in-line engines have always belonged to the  showcase drives at BMW. Since 2010, BMW Motorrad offers fascinating  high-performance and luxurious six-cylinder equipment at the highest  level with the K 1600 models. The K 1600 GT  represents the particularly agile, dynamic variant of the six-cylinder  design, while the K 1600 GTL with its more  comfortable ergonomics and standard topcase is more for pleasurable  riding. The K 1600 B is of a completely different  breed. It provides characteristic “streamlining” with a low rear  section in bagger style. Its motto is “The Spirit of the Open Road”.  It represents elegance, power and luxury on two wheels and allows the  rider to experience every road, every tour and every moment  particularly intensively. Derived from the K 1600 B, the    K 1600 Grand America finally combines the superior  performance of the six-cylinder in-line engine with exclusive  equipment features that make long-distance rides in American highway  cruising style an experience that is as comfortable as it is  fascinating, both alone or with a partner.Revised six-cylinder in-line engine according to EU-5    regulations with new engine control, knock sensor system and revised    emission concept as well as engine drag torque  control.For use in the new K 1600 GT, GTL, B and Grand  America, the inspiring six-cylinder engine has been adapted to the  current EU-5 regulations. From a technical point of view, the use of  the BMS-O engine control, two knock sensors and two additional  broadband lambda probes form the centrepiece. In addition to  drastically improved emission values, there are also noticeable  benefits relating to the power and torque of the six-cylinder engine.  The nominal capacity is still 118 kW (160 hp). However, it is now  already achieved at a rotational speed of 6 750 rpm and thus 1 000 rpm  sooner than was formerly the case. In addition, the technical new  features provide an increase of the maximum torque from previously 175  Nm to now 180 Nm at a rotational speed of still 5 250 rpm. Even more  superior pulling power and even more powerful acceleration are the  noticeable positive effects for the rider.The engine drag torque control (MSR) is another new component.  With it, unstable riding conditions, which can develop in coasting  mode or when shifting down gears due to excessive slip at the rear  wheel, can be reliably avoided.Dynamic ESA “Next Generation” electronic suspension with fully    automatic load compensation.The BMW Motorrad Dynamic ESA “Next Generation” (Electronic  Suspension Adjustment) on the new K 1600 GT, GTL, B and Grand America  enables even higher dimensions in terms of riding safety, performance  and comfort, because damping is automatically adapted to the riding  conditions and manoeuvres, and there is also automatic riding position  compensation in all load states.Highly modern LED light units and new full LED adaptive headlight.BMW Motorrad has been a pioneer for decades in terms of safety  when biking. Accordingly, the new K 1600 GT, GTL, B and Grand America  already provide highly modern LED light units as standard. The new  full LED headlight with LED lens technology and iconic daytime riding  light (depending on the market) illuminates the road with an  unrivalled bright, clear light and underlines the prestige claim of  the new six-cylinder models. Another standard component of the  headlight is the swivelling “adaptive headlight” function. With it,  the low-beam LED headlight is turned into the curve according to the  heel angle. Curves are thus almost fully illuminated because the light  is where the motorbike is moving.In addition, by swivelling the entire headlight unit (±2°), the  vehicle dynamic states (braking, accelerating) are automatically  controlled and optimum illumination is ensured at all times. In  addition, there are a number of new light functions such as the  “welcome light”.New, 10.25 inch TFT colour display with integrated map    navigation, easy-to-use route planning and comprehensive    connectivity as standard.The new K 1600 GT, GTL, B and Grand America are  standard-equipped with a new 10.25 inch TFT colour display with  integrated map navigation and connectivity. Due to excellent  readability, clear menu navigation and a highly integrated operating  concept, they are at the top of their motorbike segment. The new 10.25  inch colour display allows a navigation map to be displayed on the  instrument cluster, meaning an additional display is not required.Audio system 2.0 – a new digital sound dimension as standard    or as optional equipment ex works.With audio system 2.0, the new K 1600 GTL and Grand America  already provide an even more intensive sound experience as standard.  The audio system is available as optional equipment ex works for the  K 1600 GT and K 1600 B.Superior riding capability and six-cylinder dynamics in    attractive basic colours, exclusive style and noble Option 719    variants. Option 719 “Midnight” with water transfer printing method    for K 1600 B and K 1600 Grand America.The new K 1600  GT, GTL, B and Grand America are available in three attractive colour  options each: a basic variant, a style variant and Option 719. Option  719 “Midnight” is particularly noteworthy, which is only available for  K 1600 B and K 1600 Grand America. The highlight of this equipment  variant is the paintwork in Meteoric Dust II metallic with the  “Galaxy” theme depicted using the water transfer printing method.Highlights of BMW K 1600 GT, GTL, B and Grand America:New audio system 2.0 as optional equipment.\n"}

Now they will become true works of art. This special  collaboration is part of the MINI brand campaign BIG LOVE – two short  words with the power to inspire a world of positive action. The motto  is: “We’re all different, but pretty good together.” As part of this  project, MINI USA will be making a donation to the American  Immigration Council to support its mission.The works of art were created by three artists specially selected by  MINI and they reflect these individuals’ diverse cultural backgrounds  and experiences growing up in the United States of America:Rich Tu is an artist and designer based in Brooklyn.  He is a first-generation Filipino American who is particularly  interested in culture and the future. Rich hosts First Generation  Burden, a podcast focusing on the integration of immigrants in the  creative community.Striking colours, inherent movement and images full of detail are the  prevailing features of his highly personal works. Rich Tu’s powerful  visual style is inspired by his three passions: community, social  justice, and reflection on the first-generation immigrant experience  through self-expression. His work is entitled “Hiraya”, which is  derived from an old Filipino word meaning “fruit of hopes, dreams and aspirations”.Shane Griffin, also known as ‘Grif’, is an  award-winning, multi-disciplinary visual artist and director who is  originally from Dublin and now based in New York. Grif has worked with  many pop culture icons, including Kanye West, Kid Cudi and Wiz  Khalifa. Mainly drawing on surrealism and abstraction, Grif’s work  spans the entire spectrum of print, sculpture, animation and  live-action film. Shane’s work is entitled “ChromaFlow”.Shawna X is an independent artist and visual director  with roots in Portland who lives in New York. She is known for her  vivid, impassioned and graphic style of visual design in digital,  spatial and motion spaces. X is a reference to her Chinese name Xiayun  (Sia-yoon, the word for the shrub Ruta montana). Shawna’s  work is entitled “Roads we travel” and is a visual expression of the  paths that bring us together.“Rich Tu, Shane Griffin, Shawna X and MINI BIG LOVE exemplify how  beauty and strength can come from talented people from diverse  backgrounds working together,” said Wendy Feliz, Director of the  American Immigration Council’s Center for Inclusion and Belonging.  “We’re proud and happy to be able to benefit from these outstanding  works of art and we look forward to celebrating them and the artists  who created them.”Now sold in 109 countries all over the world, the MINI was designed  in 1959 by Alec Issigonis, a British engineer with Greek roots.

{"prompt":"The project encourages the production of natural rubber to protect biodiversity and local communities in the forest of Hutan Harapan ->","completion":" Munich, Milan, Cambridge. The BMW Group and Pirelli  are joining with Birdlife International in a three year project that  aims to favor the long-term production of sustainable and  deforestation-free natural rubber in Indonesia. Birdlife  International - an NGO that conserves global biodiversity, habitats  and birds – will be supported by its two new partners in actions to  benefit local communities, the conservation of the natural ecosystem  and protection of endangered animal species in the forests of  Indonesia. In Indonesia, the project is implemented by a number of  non-governmental organisations coordinated by the local consortium PT  Restorasi Ekosistem Indonesia (PT Reki). In Indonesia, the cultivation  of natural rubber is one of the traditional sources of income for the  local population.The project is located in part of the Hutan Harapan rainforest  (island of Sumatra), which is home to around 1,350 different animal  species. It will take the form of a series of initiatives aimed at    improving the quality of life of the indigenous communityby protecting farmers’ land rights and promoting women’s    rights, conserving a deforestation-free area of 2,700    hectares and protecting several endangered species. The  different activities will be implemented in line with the goals of the  Global Platform of Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR), the  multi-stakeholder platform for the sustainable development of the  natural rubber business, of which the BMW Group, Pirelli and Birdlife  International are founder members.The partnership between the BMW Group and Pirelli in support of  Indonesia’s Hutan Harapan forest is part of a joint pathway to  sustainable natural rubber. In this context, Pirelli developed and  produced the first tyre in the world, a Pirelli P ZERO, certified by  the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), fitted on the new BMW X5  Plug-in-Hybrid, in turn the first car in the world equipped with tyres  with this certification.  THE MAIN ACTIVITIES OF THE PROJECTThe project presented by Pirelli, the BMW Group and Birdlife  International foresees the involvement of a number of stakeholders:  local communities, government agencies and the entire natural rubber  value chain.The three year program entails multiple activities, including: Birdlife International will coordinate with Pirelli and the BMW Group  on the project’s progress and results achieved through a plan of  periodic reporting. “As a premium manufacturer, our goal is to lead the way on    sustainability and actively take responsibility within our supply    chains. In the fight against climate change, we are rolling out targeted    measures to support bio-diversity and tropical rainforest    conservation,” said Dr Andreas Wendt, BMW AG Board Member for Purchasing and    Supplier Network.“Our project in Indonesia will help people and the local economy    to work in greater harmony with nature. At the same time, it will    also support local communities by professionalising their    traditional cultivation methods for natural rubber.” Giovanni Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli’s Senior Vice President    for Sustainability and Future Mobility, said: “The    development of this project is based on the principles of    transparency and tangibility which have always guided Pirelli’s    actions. Together with BMW Group, in support of the goals of    Birdlife we intend to be an active part of a project that aims to    have a sustainable impact all round on natural rubber, in the belief    that community, biodiversity and business must grow by supporting    each other, creating a shared socio-environmental value.” Patricia Zurita, CEO, BirdLife International,  commented: “BirdLife works beyond species and sites to address    systemic drivers of the biodiversity and climate crisis, and promote    a nature positive and carbon neutral world. This is why we joined    the GPSNR and welcome this collaboration with Pirelli and BMW to    embed practices to safeguard nature within the rubber value chain”.    BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONALBirdLife International is the world’s largest nature conservation    partnership, with 117 Partners. Our purpose is to conserve global    biodiversity, habitats and birds, working with people and business    in the sustainable use of natures’ resources.  To inform and advance    evidence-based business policy and practice, we offer a wealth of    proprietary data and tools, provide science-based consultation and    have boots on the ground in 115 countries. Globally, our science and    biodiversity data inform international policy dialogue, and in the    field of ‘environment & ecology’, BirdLife is ranked #1 in the    UK for high impact research. Locally, our Partners provide acute    insight at both a landscape and community level of issues and    solutions and have the legitimacy to engage and advocate at all    levels of government. PIRELLI AND SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RUBBER Pirelli places sustainable development at the heart of its own    growth, along the entire value chain. The sustainable management of the natural rubber supply chain has    seen Pirelli committed to a roadmap of activities based on training    and the sharing of good practices in the countries where the    material originates. This is in line with the principles and values    collected in the Policy      for the Sustainable Management of Natural Rubber that the    company launched in 2017 and updated in 2021. The Policy is the    result of consultations with key stakeholders in the natural rubber    value chain including international NGOs, Pirelli’s main suppliers    of natural rubber, intermediaries and growers of the supply chain,    automotive clients and multi-lateral international organizations. In    addition, Pirelli is one of the founder members of the Global    Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR), a multi-stakeholder    platform born in 2018 with the goal of supporting the sustainable    development of the natural rubber business at the global level, to    the benefit of the whole value chain. Uniting sustainability and    innovation, Pirelli is the first company in the world to have    produced a line of tyres with natural rubber and rayon both    certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). THE BMW GROUPWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the    BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles    and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility    services.

The first confirmed  highlights will be the 24-hour races in Dubai (UAE) and Daytona (USA)  in January 2022. To give the teams and drivers the best possible  chance to prepare with the new GT car, BMW M Motorsport organised a  week of testing at Valencia (ESP) in October, which was attended by  many buyers and interested parties. BMW works drivers Augusto Farfus  (BRA) and Jens Klingmann (GER), who have both been heavily involved in  the development of the BMW M4 GT3 so are very familiar with the car,  taught the guests all about the strengths and special features of the  successor to the BMW M6 GT3. After plenty of test laps, the feedback  from the BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers was extremely positive.  Robert Ravaglia (ITA), DTM Champion and World Touring Car Champion in  the BMW M3 E30 and current team manager of the Italian team Ceccato  Racing, was impressed after his test drive, and said: “Congratulations  to BMW M Motorsport on the development of this car. It was a fantastic  experience being allowed to take it for a spin for a couple of laps.  After my first few laps in the BMW M3 E30 – the most successful  touring car of all time – back in the 1980s, I could tell it was going  to be a winning car. And I had the same feeling today. The BMW M4 GT3  is a winning car.” ADAC GT Masters: Schubert Motorsport leave Hockenheim empty-handed.The penultimate race weekend of the ADAC GT Masters at Hockenheim  (GER) was disappointing for Schubert Motorsport. Despite their good  pace, Nick Yelloly (GBR) and Jesse Krohn (FIN) came away empty-handed  in the BMW M6 GT3 after incidents in both races. After qualifying in  eleventh place, the duo initially moved their way up the field well on  Saturday, but a tyre puncture late on in the race saw them cross the  finish line in P22. Yelloly was outstanding in qualifying on Sunday  and finished second to secure a place on the front row of the grid.  Unfortunately, a collision early in the race forced him to retire. ADAC GT4 Germany: Fight for the title coming to a head.Gabriele Piana (ITA) and Michael Schrey (GER) of Team Hofor Racing by  Bonk Motorsport showed real fighting spirit at a difficult penultimate  race weekend in the ADAC GT4 Germany at the Hockenheimring (GER) and  defended their lead in the drivers’ standings. It was in qualifying  that their BMW M4 GT4 really struggled, not allowing for any better  than eleventh and 22nd on the grid for the two races. From  that position the duo made up two places on Saturday and eleven on  Sunday, which saw them pick up important points for finishing in P9  and P11. In the overall standings, Piana and Schrey have a 21-point  advantage over their closest rivals going into the season finale on  the first weekend in November at the Nürburgring (GER). The best race  result for a BMW M Motorsport team at the Hockenheim weekend was  claimed by Nicolaj Möller-Madsen (DEN) and Philipp Miemois (FIN) on  Saturday.

{"prompt":" Plant Munich launches production of the fully electric BMW i4  At least half of all cars from Munich plant will be electrified by 2023  Project for emission-free transport logistics in home plant gets under way  Nedeljković: “BMW i4 is a milestone on the road to electric mobility.” ->","completion":" Plant Munich launches production of the fully electric BMW i4   At least half of all cars from Munich plant will be electrified by  2023  Project for emission-free transport logistics in home plant  gets under way  Nedeljković: “BMW i4 is a milestone on the road to  electric mobility.” Munich. The first series-produced BMW i4 has today  rolled off the production lines at BMW Group Plant Munich. The  company’s home plant now manufactures all drive variants on a single  assembly line. “For the plant and team, the launch of the BMW i4 is a  milestone on the road to electric mobility,” said Milan Nedeljković,  BMW AG Board Member for Production. “By 2023 more than half of all  vehicles from our Munich facility will have an electrified drive. The  majority will be fully electric. So Munich goes fully electric.” Setting up production of the fully electric BMW i4 in the confines of  the almost 100-year-old plant, the conversion and installation of  systems proved particularly challenging. “We succeeded in integrating  the new vehicle into our existing systems without halting production.  The team and our partners did an amazing job,” added Peter Weber,  Director of BMW Group Plant Munich. Space constraints notwithstanding,  existing systems were removed, and new ones installed and ramped up.  “Our bodyshop is a shining example of intelligent, efficient  integration. Most of the new production processes for the BMW i4 can  be carried out on the existing bodyshop systems,” Weber explained. Integrating electromobility into series productionThe main difference between the BMW i4 and conventional architectures  is the electric drive and high-voltage battery. About 90 percent of  the existing systems in the Munich bodyshop can still be used for the  new model. Additional ones were required only for the floor assembly  and rear end. Another highly complex topic was the integration into assembly of the  high-voltage battery. The battery pack is now bolted onto the body by  a new, fully automated battery assembly system that works from below.  Fully automated, high-resolution camera systems scan it thoroughly  beforehand to ensure the surface is absolutely clean and there are no  impurities that could cause damage. The BMW Group’s home plant now manufactures an extensive portfolio of  products, comprising not only the BMW i4 but also the  combustion-powered and hybrid BMW 3 Series Sedan and Touring, the BMW  M3 and the BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe. The scope of production is a  testament not only to the plant’s flexibility but also to the  outstanding skills of its associates. Digitalisation is progressing Increasing digitalisation plays an important part in BMW Group  production. The whole of Plant Munich is currently being 3D-scanned in  minute detail to obtain a full set of basic digital data of both the  building and its systems. The scans are then processed and saved on  the cloud so the data can be accessed from anywhere using an  intuitive, browser-based tool. Several plants have already been fully  3D-scanned – Spartanburg and Regensburg among them – and Plant  Dingolfing is undergoing the process at the moment. By the end of  2022, the structure of all the major car plants in the BMW Group  production network will have been scanned, and digital data will be  available for everyone. The BMW Group already utilises virtual planning tools to plan  buildings and systems today. Axle pre-assembly for the BMW i4, for  example, was planned with the Omniverse Nucleus platform, by NVIDIA.  This converges data from the design and planning tools of various  producers to create photorealistic real-time simulations in a single  collaborative environment. The data from the 3D scans is also fed into  the Omniverse platform.Other digital applications are used directly in production. Radio  frequency identification (RFID), for example, allows parts to be  identified and assigned contactlessly and automatically along the  value chain, eliminating the need for manual scanning and ensuring the  right one is fitted to the right car. RFID technology is already in  use in seat production but has also made its way into various areas of  vehicle assembly at Plant Munich. The smart labels required for it are  attached to parts while they are still with suppliers or in BMW Group  component production, ready for use in assembly. They are then picked  up by line-side antennae that track every labelled component in every  car. Digitalisation of this kind makes processes faster and more  secure, and enhances efficiency and quality as a result. Reverse osmosis system cuts water consumption by six million litresWithin the production system, the issue of sustainability is of  fundamental importance, and the BMW Group has adopted a holistic  approach to reducing CO2 emissions and minimising the use  of resources. Between 2006 and 2020, resource consumption per car  produced fell more than half, and CO2 emissions have  dropped even further, by 78 percent. The aim is to reduce  CO2 emissions per vehicle produced by another 80 percent by  2030. At Plant Munich some changes have been made and a series of new  measures implemented. That’s why the plant now uses reverse osmosis to  cut freshwater consumption. The system was integrated into production  in the spring of this year and now treats water from the cathodic dip  – where the base coat is applied to vehicles – so it can be re-used  for the same stage of the process. The new system is expected to  reduce total annual freshwater consumption by more than six million  litres. Since 1997, BMW Group Plant Munich has been using groundwater  from its own source on the plant campus. This provides enough to cover  about half of the plant’s annual needs and makes a significant  contribution towards saving valuable drinking water. New sustainability target: zero local emissions from transport    logistics With a particular focus on reducing CO2 emissions, the BMW  Group has also announced another goal to coincide with the production  launch of the BMW i4: over the next few years, local emissions from  transport logistics at Plant Munich will gradually fall to zero. This  will be achieved mainly by making greater use of rail transport and  battery-electric trucks. At the moment more than 750 truck deliveries  are required daily for the delivery of parts. In the future the  inner-city stretches of these journeys will be made by electric  trucks. In addition, the share of vehicles leaving plant Munich by  train will gradually increase from the current 50 percent. The  ultimate aim is to eliminate emissions completely from transport  logistics in the Munich area, but also to bring about significant cuts  within a broader radius and from intercontinental transportation. Peter Weber, Director of BMW Group Plant Munich: “We are well aware  that, owing to the city location of our production facility, we have a  special responsibility. Our project to reduce CO2 emissions  at our home plant will have a major impact that’s positive both for  the environment and for our immediate neighbourhood.” Since last year, all the energy sourced worldwide by the BMW Group  has been green. For production of the BMW i4, for example, the  environmental credentials of green energy were further enhanced by  sourcing it directly from regional hydro-electric power stations.  Furthermore, starting this year, the BMW Group is offsetting its  remaining (Scope 1 + 2) CO2 emissions from production.  These are caused by combined heat and power generation and are fully  offset worldwide with relevant carbon credits. The transformation and future focus of the home plant continueThe integration of the BMW i4 into existing production structures  came at an investment of €200 million. The i4 is an important  trailblazer for the Neue Klasse, due for rollout in Munich and other  plants around the middle of this decade, and designed purely for  electric powertrains. The BMW Group first announced its plans to upgrade Plant Munich for  electromobility less than a year ago: new vehicle assembly and  bodyshop facilities were to be constructed, and engine production was  to relocate to other parts of the production network. Since then,  hundreds of associates have started working at other technologies or  other facilities. By the end of this year, four-cylinder engine  production will have relocated to Hams Hall, UK, and Steyr, Austria.  The relocation of engine production as a whole from Munich will reach  completion by 2024 at the latest.\n"}

In    the saddle will be two well-known WorldSBK riders: Eugene Laverty    (IRL) and Loris Baz (FRA). 35-year-old BMW works rider Laverty has been racing in WorldSBK since  2011 and enters his third season with BMW Motorrad Motorsport in 2022.  Baz also comes with plenty of WorldSBK experience: The 28-year-old  Frenchman rode a BMW S 1000 RR in WorldSBK in 2018. Baz made his  Superbike World Championship debut in 2012 and started in the series  for three years, before switching to MotoGP from 2015 to 2017. He then  returned to WorldSBK. In the 2021 season, Baz has been riding in  MotoAmerica but has also impressed on a number of outings in WorldSBK.  His WorldSBK record to date: two wins and 20 podiums. Baz will now be  a BMW works rider in the 2022 season. Jonas Folger (GER), who lined up in WorldSBK with the Bonovo MGM  Racing team in 2021, will be looking for a new challenge after what  has been a difficult season for him. The cooperation in the WorldSBK  has been terminated by mutual consent. Quotes. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: “The Bonovo  action BMW Racing Team is an important part of our WorldSBK project  and we are really looking forward to intensifying the cooperation.  Jürgen Röder’s and Michael Galinski’s team brings a lot of commitment  and passion for motor racing to the FIM Superbike World Championship.  The fact that this BMW team is now expanding and will line up with two  BMW M 1000 RR is an important step for the team and BMW Motorrad  Motorsport’s entire WorldSBK project. The team is well-positioned  coming into the new season, with two factory bikes and BMW works  riders Eugene Laverty and Loris Baz. We are looking forward to tasting  success together in the 2022 WorldSBK!” Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  course is set for a successful second season together for BMW Motorrad  Motorsport and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team in the WorldSBK. The  team and we have gained a lot of experience in the first year of our  cooperation, and that now forms the basis as we continue to move  forward together. The two riders starting for the Bonovo action BMW  Racing Team also underline our ambition. We are very pleased that  Eugene Laverty remains a part of the BMW works rider family and lines  up with us in his third season. Although the 2021 season was not  always easy for him, he showed a lot of fight and was very committed  to our project. At the same time, we are pleased to have Loris Baz on  board. Having spent a season on the BMW S 1000 RR in 2018, he is now  part of the BMW works rider family. Loris has more than impressed on  his WorldSBK outings this season. We are confident that, with their  skill and experience, Eugene and Loris will help move the Bonovo  action BMW Racing Team forward. We would like to thank Jonas Folger.  It is a shame that his debut season in WorldSBK did not play out as we  were all hoping. However, he and the team never gave up and always  worked hard. We are very grateful to him for that tireless commitment.” Jürgen Röder, Team Owner Bonovo action BMW Racing Team:  “I am overjoyed that we are heading into the next year as a  strong BMW Team and that two top riders like Eugene Laverty and Loris  Baz will be in the saddle of the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team bikes.  The goal is for the two BMW teams to cooperate even more closely. It  is great for us to have two strong riders on board. Particularly  Eugene, who has been on the BMW for a few years, is an extremely  analytical rider, and provides feedback that can be excellently  incorporated in the further development of the bike. He knows all the  structures at BMW, and who he needs to contact and when, and is  obviously a great addition to the team. I think 28-year-old Loris is a  great young rider. We have seen what he is capable of. He has done  well in MotoAmerica, has returned to World Superbike and has achieved  some very impressive results. It is a real godsend for me to have  someone like him in our team. I think we have a real chance of  consistently finishing in the top ten with both riders next season.  That is obviously a real asset for the whole BMW family. At this  point, I would like to thank Dr. Markus Schramm and Marc Bongers again  for integrating us so closely in the BMW structure. We will do  everything we can to live up to this privilege that has been bestowed  upon us. At the same time, I would like to thank Jonas Folger for his  commitment. He showed great character when came to me and said that he  would not be able to add anything to the team in 2022, and that he  would not be taking up my option of continuing together in WorldSBK. I  find that incredibly impressive. We still have a very good  relationship, and that will remain the case.” Michael Galinski, Team Manager Bonovo action BMW Racing Team:  “We are pleased to be able to take this step together with  Jürgen Röder, and are very proud of our two riders. In Eugene Laverty  and Loris Baz we have two excellent riders. Loris has started in many  classes, such as MotoGP and Superbikes, on many different  manufacturers’ bikes, including BMW and Yamaha. He recently showed  what he is capable of at the race in Portugal: two third places as a  reserve rider is no mean feat. We are very pleased to have him on  board. Eugene has been slightly below par this year, as he was unable  to ride for a long time. He is a great development rider and will help  us to develop the bike together with BMW. All in all, we are now on  equal footing with the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. They also have two  tall riders on the bike, in Michael van der Mark and Scott Redding.  Loris, as the third tall guy, will be able to contribute to the  development in this regard. Eugene is not quite as tall, but  nevertheless we are all moving in the same direction together. We are  looking forward to the coming season!” Eugene Laverty: “I’m very happy to continue with BMW  Motorrad and join the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team for the 2022 World  Superbike season. It is fantastic to remain in the BMW WorldSBK  family. The past six months have been tough for me as a rider and so  I’m very grateful for the continued support and belief from everyone  involved in this project. I’m very motivated to repay that faith in my  abilities and I feel confident that following a solid winter testing  campaign we can arrive ready and competitive at round one.” Loris Baz: “I am really happy to be back in WorldSBK  so I want to thank BMW and the Bonovo action BMW Racing Team for  giving me this opportunity. I think that I have shown during these two  rounds in Spain and Portugal that I have the pace to fight at the  front in this championship. BMW is the brand that grew the most in the  second part of the season. I have closely watched how the bike was  improving. I have been racing with BMW before so I know a lot of  people there and also, I have been competing with MGM Racing for one  race back in 2012. I am really happy and really excited about this  opportunity and am looking forward to trying the bike and to starting  to work together with the team and BMW. Thanks again to all the people  involved in this project.” \n"}

At the start of October, BMW Junior Team completed its    first season with a GT3 car on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER) –    and although a DNF in the final race prevented them from taking the    title, it was still an extremely successful year for Dan Harper    (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA). Two wins and four    podiums in the BMW M6 GT3 earned them second place overall in the    GT3 class and the NLS Speed Trophy. In November, BMW Junior Team    heads to the USA, where they will attend both Petit Le Mans at Road    Atlanta and the 24 Hours of Sebring. Hesse and Verhagen will even    have the opportunity to take part in the Creventic 24H Series race    in a BMW M4 GT3. The rapid development of BMW Junior Team, which started in 2020 in  the BMW M240i Racing and BMW M4 GT4 in the Nürburgring Endurance  Series (NLS), continued seamlessly in 2021 with the BMW M6 GT3, run by  BMW Team RMG. Victories in races four and five of the season on the  Nordschleife, backed up by one second place and a third place in the  second half of the season, are definitive proof that Harper, Hesse and  Verhagen have established themselves among the top GT drivers. Within  a short time, they have gone from promising, talented youngsters to  proven winners. The next step for the BMW Junior Team in 2022 is the  BMW M4 GT3. They will set their sights on overall victory at the  Nürburgring 24 Hours with BMW Motorsport’s new GT3 flagship. The team was given its first taste of the BMW M4 GT3 during tests.  Hesse and Verhagen will now have the opportunity to contest their  first race in this car in November. The whole BMW Junior Team first  travels to Petit Le Mans, the final round of this season’s IMSA  WeatherTech SportsCar Championship at Road Atlanta, from where they  head straight to the Creventic 24 Hours of Sebring. Bill Auberlen,  Robby Foley and James Clay (all USA) will be at the wheel of a BMW M4  GT3 there. Alongside this trio, there are still two places available  for drivers with a Silver racing licence. Hesse and Verhagen fall into  this category. As Harper already possesses a Gold licence, he must  wait for his first race outing. However, he will be involved in all  the workflows at the circuit and will also complete a number of test  laps, in order to familiarise himself with both the car and the track. The BMW M8 GTE and BMW M6 GT3 bid farewell at Road Atlanta.BMW Junior Team will witness the farewell appearances of the BMW M8  GTE and BMW M6 GT3 at the IMSA season finale at Road Atlanta. At the  wheel of BMW Team RLL’s two BMW M8 GTEs will be John Edwards (USA),  Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Augusto Farfus (BRA), and Connor De Phillippi  (USA), Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT). Turner Motorsport  will also run a BMW M6 GT3 in the GTD class. Quotes from the BMW Junior Team on the 2021 season: Jochen Neerpasch, mentor to the BMW Junior Team:“BMW Junior Team has developed rapidly. From the BMW M240i Racing and  the BMW M4 GT4 to the BMW M6 GT3, they have only ever needed a few  races to achieve success. In my opinion, that can be traced back to  our team building. As a team, they learn a huge amount from each other  and thus develop faster than other racing drivers who are on their  own. I am sure that the three of them are now capable of winning the  24-hour race at the Nürburgring.” Stefan Reinhold, team principal BMW Team RMG:“For us as a team from the Eifel region, it was obviously fantastic  to finally go racing and taste success on the Nordschleife. In this  regard, the season has been great. We saw at the 24-hour race that our  young drivers can mix it with the best. After that, they have  consistently been among the front-runners, and we have claimed our  first victories. That makes us both happy and proud.” Dan Harper on the NLS season:“Fortunately, we have had more highs than lows this season. We could  never have dreamed that we would still be in contention to win a title  in the final race so we can take a lot of positives from the year. Our  learning curve has been very steep and we have gained valuable  experience, as drivers and a team. That will definitely make us  stronger in the future.” Max Hesse on the NLS season:“We gained an awful lot of experience in the NLS season and have  developed massively as racing drivers and a team. Second place in the  Speed Trophy is a good result, even if it is obviously a shame that we  lost the title due to a crash in the final race.” Max Hesse on his start in Sebring:“The start at Sebring is a superb opportunity for us. Personally, I  have never raced in the USA, so to do that in the new BMW M4 GT3 and  at such an iconic circuit is mega. Hopefully the weather will play  ball and we will have our first full 24-hour race, after the race at  the Nürburgring was cut short.” Neil Verhagen on the NLS season:“I think we can be very proud of what we achieved this season,  despite the unfortunate way it ended. A huge thank you goes to BMW  Team RMG for the fantastic work and support. We have all proved that  we are not only young trainees driving anywhere, but that we belong  among the best. It was not easy to learn everything in our first year  in a GT3 race car, but Dan, Max and I helped each other a lot. We  worked perfectly as the BMW Junior Team.” Neil Verhagen on his start in Sebring:“I cannot describe how excited I am about racing in my home country  in the BMW M4 GT3. I have dreamed of racing in the USA again for  years. My parents will be at Sebring to watch me drive the new BMW M4  GT3. That is going to be a very special experience for me.” \n"}
{"prompt":" Agreement with Swedish startup H2 Green Steel: first deliveries for Neue Klasse from 2025  Up to 95% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to conventional methods  Delivery to BMW Group plants in Europe  Circular economy: Sheet metal remnants from BMW Group plants will be recycled and reused  Wendt: “Vital contribution to our goal of reducing CO2 emissions in our steel supply chain by about two million tonnes by 2030”   ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group continues to push forward with  climate protection and is systematically pursuing its goal of  significantly reducing CO2 emissions at their source in the  supply chain. From 2025 on, the company plans to source steel produced  with up to 95% less CO2 emissions and without requiring  fossil resources such as coal. The BMW Group has now reached an  agreement to this effect with the Swedish startup H2 Green Steel,  which uses hydrogen and only green power from renewable energies for  steel production. Owing to its particularly energy-intensive  manufacturing process, steel production is considered one of the main  sources of global CO2 emissions.“Our goal is to reduce CO2 emissions in our steel supply  chain by about two million tonnes by 2030. Sourcing steel produced  using hydrogen and green power can make a vital contribution to this,”  says Dr Andreas Wendt, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG  responsible for Purchasing and Supplier Network. “Steel is essential  for producing cars and will be no less important for future vehicle  generations. Innovative technologies that enable virtually carbon-free  production of steel have a significant impact on our ability to reduce  CO2 emissions in our steel supply chain.” Closed-loop material cycleIn addition to the  delivery of steel produced using green power, the BMW Group and H2  Green Steel have also agreed to create a closed-loop material cycle.  H2 Green Steel will take back sheet metal remnants, such as those  produced at press plants when doors are punched out, and will process  them in such a way that they can be shipped back to the plants as new  steel rolls, also known as steel coils. In this way, raw materials can  be used multiple times in a circular economy and natural resources  protected. Since it requires less energy to produce, secondary steel  lowers CO2 emissions by an average of 50-80%, compared to  primary material.The BMW Group is already using between 20% and 100% secondary steel  in its vehicles and will continue to increase this percentage in the  future. BMW Group press plants in Europe process more than half a  million tonnes of steel per year. Ideal location in northern Sweden H2 Green Steel is building its steel production site in the province  of Norrbotten in northern Sweden, close to the Arctic Circle. The  region is best known for its reindeer and spectacular northern lights,  but also provides access to high-quality iron ore, plentiful energy  from renewable sources such as hydroelectric and wind power, a major  seaport and generations of steel production know-how.Unlike conventional processes that rely on coke for making steel, the  company employs hydrogen produced using green power to remove the  oxygen from the iron oxide. This so-called direct reduction of iron  ore produces almost no CO2 at all, only water – thereby  avoiding 95% of the CO2 emissions normally produced. The  specially built hydrogen power plant, which uses water and green power  from across the region, will be directly integrated into the steel  production plant. The company also uses local green power for the  remainder of the manufacturing process. BMW Group to source Northvolt battery cells from the same    region from 2024 on Swedish company Northvolt, which develops and produces battery cells  for electric cars, is also exploiting the potential for green power in  the north of Sweden.Last year, the BMW Group signed a long-term battery-cell supply  contract with Northvolt. The battery cells will be produced in Europe  at the Northvolt gigafactory currently under construction in  Skellefteå in northern Sweden from 2024. The company will use only  green electricity from local wind and hydroelectric power to produce  the battery cells. Neue Klasse poised to set new standards From 2025 onwards, the BMW Group will be realigning its product range  – which has grown successfully over decades –on the basis of the Neue  Klasse. The Neue Klasse will be characterised by three key aspects: a  completely redefined IT and software architecture, a new generation of  high-performance electric drive trains and batteries and a radically  new level of sustainability across the entire vehicle lifecycle. These  strands are interwoven within an overall vehicle architecture that has  been uncompromisingly optimised for electric drive trains, setting a  new benchmark in terms of digitisation and electrification, while at  the same time ensuring that the characteristic flair of a typical  BMW is transferred to future vehicle generations. Active commitment to environmental and social standards in the    steel supply chain As part of its involvement with the not-for-profit organisation  ResponsibleSteel, the BMW Group actively participated in establishing  environmental and social standards throughout the entire steel value  chain, starting at the mine. This sustainability standard for  production sites in the steel industry was published in 2019 as part  of a multi-stakeholder process and now forms the basis for  certification. ResponsibleSteel is the steel industry’s first global  multi-stakeholder standard and certification initiative.\n"}
{"prompt":"Retuned springs and dampers, precise tweaks to the chassis and an optimised soundtrack turn the BMW M premium compact model’s performance up another notch. ->","completion":" Munich. BMW has honed the track-inspired  characteristics of its four-cylinder high-performance model for the  premium compact segment. Detail upgrades to its chassis components  endow the BMW M135i xDrive (fuel  consumption combined: 7.8 – 7.3 l\/100 km [36.2 – 38.7 mpg imp] as per  WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 177 – 167 g\/km as per WLTP) with  noticeably enhanced performance qualities. And the retuned drive  soundtrack in the cabin makes the driving experience even more  emotionally engaging.The standout power of the 225 kW\/306 hp four-cylinder unit with BMW  TwinPower Turbo technology under the bonnet of the BMW M135i xDrive is  harnessed more effectively than ever to produce the captivating  dynamics and driving experience for which BMW is renowned. Detailed  set-up modifications for the bespoke chassis technology result in even  better mounting, ensuring precisely controllable driving  characteristics even when pushing hard on the track. The optimised  traction enables drivers to explore the car’s performance limits with  confidence, especially when cornering at extremely high speeds.Sharper cornering dynamics thanks    to optimised camber values, new mounts, and precision tuning of    spring and damping systems.The camber values for the front wheels of the BMW M135i xDrive have  been increased to optimise absorption of lateral forces when powering  through corners. A new hydromount has additionally been used to attach  the front suspension wishbones, while the mounts for the trailing and  control arms at the rear axle have also been redesigned. At the same  time, the spring and damping systems have undergone recalibration. The  result is a significant improvement in roll behaviour in corners,  which has a further beneficial effect on steering feel when the car’s  sporting abilities are put to the test.This latest raft of modifications reinforces the commitment of the  BMW M135i xDrive to delivering BMW’s hallmark driving pleasure. Its  chassis technology combines with the engine’s extremely sporty  performance characteristics and BMW xDrive intelligent all-wheel drive  to create a flawlessly composed overall package for a richly engaging  drive. The compact BMW M model comes as standard with near-actuator  wheel slip limitation integrated into the engine control unit. The  resultant shortening of the signal paths allows traction to be  controlled up to ten times faster than with conventional systems when  pulling away, on slippery surfaces and during dynamic cornering. The  BMW M135i xDrive additionally benefits from a mechanical limited-slip  differential at the front axle. Built into the car’s standard  eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission, it enhances traction and  directional stability along with agility and cornering dynamics. With  locking factors of 36 per cent when accelerating and 26 per cent on  the overrun, the differential is capable of transferring extra torque  to the front wheel with better grip as and when required. The  customary Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) functions are complemented  in the BMW M135i xDrive by Performance Control, which optimises the  car’s steering behaviour with judicious applications of the brakes.Specially tuned M Sport steering and exceptionally powerful M Sport  brakes can also be found on the standard equipment list for the BMW  M135i xDrive. The compact sports car leaves the factory on 18-inch M  light-alloy wheels as standard, with the option of 19-inch light-alloy  items available in a variety of designs.Dramatic acoustic experience in the cabin.The twin-tailpipe exhaust system facilitates power delivery from the  engine with its reduced backpressure, while also producing a  characterful acoustic accompaniment. The distinctive, emotion-stirring  sound is also transmitted into the interior, where it is carefully  amplified through the audio system’s speakers.The revised soundtrack conveys the signature four-cylinder engine  note of a BMW M model to those on board more authentically than ever.  The instant response to every movement of the accelerator is  translated into corresponding acoustic signals. From the powerful  building of torque under acceleration through to the drop-off in load  on the overrun, the power unit’s operating state is clearly  discernible at all times. Starting the engine prompts a sound  composition specially created for this model, adding another facet to  the rich acoustic experience inside the car.New paint finishes for a high-impact look.A new selection of particularly striking paint finishes has been  introduced to accompany the performance enhancements and underscore  the individual character of the BMW M135i xDrive. BMW Individual paint  finishes and special customer requests can also now be incorporated  into the manufacturing process at BMW Group Plant Leipzig, where the  compact model is built. The special colours require additional  servicing and technical support work, with an increased number of  manual processes. To cater for this, an existing paint shop was  modified and the number of employees working there increased by ten.The BMW Individual paint finishes bring even greater visual impact to  the high-performance model’s modern design language and bespoke  styling features. New additions to the range of exterior colours for  the BMW M135i xDrive include the M paint shade Sao Paulo Yellow  non-metallic, as well as the Frozen Orange metallic and Frozen Pure  Grey finishes.\n"}

Eugene Laverty (IRL) completed Sunday’s races in 15th and 16th    positions. San Juan was hosting the penultimate round of the 2021    season in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Van der Mark began Sunday morning’s Superpole race from sixth place.  He fell back a little during the opening laps and was eighth on lap  three, wedged into a tight group. Van der Mark prevailed over his  rivals in the second half of the race, working his way up to fifth and  that was the position in which he crossed the line after ten laps.  Laverty began the Superpole race from twelfth place. He moved up to  tenth after a good start before losing two positions again as the  first lap progressed. He remained in twelfth until the penultimate lap  before slipping back down to fifteenth. In the second main race, van der Mark made a good start and  battled  away in fifth place in the leading group. He was applying pressure on  the riders ahead as he aimed for fourth place. however he lost a place  towards the halfway point of the race and fell back to sixth.  Nonetheless, van der Mark remained in touch but the gap to the top  five stretched out a little on the closing laps. He was never in  danger of losing sixth position before crossing the line after  completing 21 laps. Laverty endured a difficult second main race.

Laverty did gain one position on the penultimate lap, crossing  the line in 16th place. The season finale for the WorldSBK 2021 will take place from 19th to  21st November at the new Mandalika circuit in Indonesia. Quotes after race two at San Juan. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “A great result today from Michael on the BMW M 1000 RR. From  where we started on Friday to where we finished today has been  fantastic hard work from him and his crew and a testament to the steps  that we have taken. We never quite got the chance for the podium today  but a fifth and two sixth-places in the three races is a great reward  for the hard work. To finish eight seconds behind the winner and just  a couple of seconds off the podium in today’s main race just shows how  much improvement we have made with the bike so it was great work by  Mickey and his team. Eugene unfortunately struggled today. In  practice, he and Michael rode together and they swapped places to see  where Eugene had issues but it seems that we could not transfer that  into comfortable settings so Eugene was struggling both in the  Superpole race and in the main race. It is a shame for him as he had  deserved much better results than these. Thanks to Eugene for stepping  in for Tom at the last three rounds. Now we are looking forward to  Tom’s return in Indonesia.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  has been a good Sunday. This morning in warm-up, we tried something  different with the bike but in the end we weren’t really sure so we  went back to yesterday’s set-up. In the Superpole race, I had a good  race, I had fun and enjoyed it a lot. I had some good battles and was  pretty fast, faster than yesterday. It was nice to start from fifth on  the grid for race two. I had an okay start and was in the group  fighting for the podium. To be honest, in the beginning I was  struggling a bit with the full fuel tank. Towards the end of the race  I was alone but I was riding a good pace and it was nice to see what  we can do. I think that it has been an overall good weekend. We take  some good points home and it was nice to be able to fight with the  guys for the podium today in race two but for sure we need to be a  little bit faster.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Altogether, from my side, it has been a very tough weekend.  I struggled to make progress. We changed the bike to improve my  feeling and we never made any major breakthrough. Also in the last  race to finish outside the points after giving my everything over the  entire race was a bitter pill to swallow so I am disappointed with my  performance. All the guys in the team deserved a better result but  unfortunately I wasn’t able to deliver it. Thanks for this great  opportunity to be in the team for these three rounds. I am just  disappointed with myself that I could not do more.” \n"}

Both Michael and Eugene have made big steps forward as we expected  from yesterday’s performance. In Superpole, Michael only narrowly  missed out the second row and Eugene did great job to get on the  fourth row in twelfth position from where he had started the weekend  so going into race one, both guys were in a much happier situation. I  think the bikes are very alike in set-up which is something that we  strive towards. Going into the race, both guys felt very comfortable.  Mostly the entire grid selected the same rear tyre, the SCX which  proved to be the only tyre suiting for these conditions. Mickey had a  solid race. From seventh position he battled to sixth. From there he  could not improve position despite the fact that his fastest lap of  the race came at the very end. This showed that we have a good basis  to work on overnight. In the last five or six laps, Mickey was first  or second quickest on track but it just was not possible for him to  further improve from sixth position. It was a great effort from him  today and clearly fourth to sixth is the target for tomorrow. Eugene  just fell back a little bit towards the end of the race. Before, he  was in a good position in a good group of riders but as the fuel load  went down, the balance of his bike changed and he was not that  comfortable anymore. We will work on that for tomorrow. Overall, it  was a not too-bad day. Obviously, we are striving for more but  generally we can say that race one was successful for both riders and  we are looking forward to the Superpole race and race two tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We  have made a big step forward this morning in FP3 compared to  yesterday. I was happier with the bike. We made a small change during  the session and it was alright. Superpole was quite good; starting  seventh on the grid was okay. I did not have a great start, but got  into a rhythm and passed some guys. It was a long and a bit of a  boring race. I had some small battles but had some limitations trying  to pass people but in the end I think sixth isn’t that bad. Now we  have to find some small improvements on the bike and we will be fine tomorrow.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Superpole went quite well for me. I managed to qualify  twelfth and was happy with the lap time that I did with the qualifying  tyre. Also the beginning of the race went well. I made a good start  and overtook some guys. After a few laps I was up in eighth position.  With a full tank of fuel, the bike was feeling very good but  unfortunately once the fuel load went down the bike became very  difficult for me and I was struggling towards the end so we need to  re-balance the bike to make it better for whenever the fuel tank goes  empty. That’s the plan for tomorrow and I am confident that it won’t  be such a big job and that we will be a little bit stronger towards  the end of the races tomorrow.” \n"}

The collaboration between BMW and Coldplay  will witness a new highlight. Following the successful hit “Higher  Power” synced in the BMW i4\/ix purpose film and the British band’s  performance in the virtual world of BMW JOYTOPIA at the IAA Mobility  in Munich, BMW will now provide the world’s first ever mobile,  rechargeable show battery for the bands upcoming Music Of The Spheres  World Tour. In the summer of 2022, the four musicians are also  scheduled to perform in Frankfurt and Berlin.The show battery will provide the necessary electric power during the  live performances with more than 40 recyclable car batteries, making  the series of concerts more sustainable and one of the greenest tours  in music history. The collaboration between BMW and Coldplay sets new  benchmarks and could become the blueprint for the entire live industry.The storage technology for the power supply during the live  performances will be provided by partly recycled BMW i3 batteries. The  show battery will provide the necessary super low emission, electric  power and replace the usual diesel and petrol generators, which will  in turn result in a significant reduction of the carbon footprint of  all the band’s live performances. It will be recharged using a range  of renewable sources including solar installations, a kinetic stadium  floor, power bikes and generators powered by Hydrotreated Vegetable  Oil. The kinetic stadium floor and the power bikes will harness the  collective power of the fans themselves.BMW i3 batteries were the first in the worldwide automotive industry  suitable for second-life use without additional processing. The  technology is an essential part of the BMW Group’s vision of  sustainability and circular economy.“We’re proud to partner with BMW to create the world’s first  tourable, rechargeable show battery – which will allow us to power our  concerts almost entirely from clean, renewable energy”, says  Coldplay’s Chris Martin. ““A common awareness of sustainability has led during recent years to  an intensive, creative co-creation process between BMW and Coldplay,”  emphasises Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President Customer and Brand BMW.  “The campaign song, “Higher Power“, marking the launch of our  all-electric models BMW iX and BMW i4, as well as Coldplay’s  performance at BMWs virtual world of JOYTOPIA during the IAA Mobility,  were the first major highlights of our successful cooperation.

Then, the band featuring Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland,  Will Champion and Guy Berryman played in front of 1,500 enthusiastic  fans, marking the end of their “Ghost Stories Tour” at BMW Welt in  Munich. These initial contacts and the mutual awareness of  sustainability finally resulted in a collaboration between BMW and Coldplay.The campaign for the electric vehicles BMW iX and BMW i4 in June 2021  was the first major success of this collaboration between a brand and  a band. BMW and Coldplay jointly developed the campaign in a unique  co-creation process. The campaign song “Higher Power“ became a massive  hit and the line “This joy is electric” the perfect brand message for  the two new BMW premium models.Sustainable world tour as the blueprint for the entire live    industry  At the IAA Mobility in Munich in September 2021, which was held under  the motto “RE:IMAGINE TODAY” and very much in the spirit of the BMW  Groups vision of sustainability and circular economy, a further major  success of this co-creation was then achieved. BMW’s newly created  Metaverse JOYTOPIA presented an entirely virtual performance by  Coldplay. The musicians’ show could be viewed online for 24 hours and  was seen by more than 150,000 people worldwide. For the digital world,  JOYTOPIA was a quantum leap in terms of marketing and corporate communication This successful collaboration between BMW and Coldplay has now been  further extended, leading to a new climax during next year’s world  tour. As a partner and supplier of recyclable car batteries, BMW will  support the British band not only with achieving the goal of becoming  even more sustainable. The cooperation is a game changer and could  become a blueprint for the entire live industry.https:\/\/www.bmw.com\/en\/automotive-life\/coldplay-sustainable-live-music-experience.htmlhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=loYO_aNqYOI\n"}

The clubs  represented in the BMW Clubs International Council form an  exceptionally large and proactive international association. The  diverse club life of the members of around 700 clubs includes joint  activities, road trips and events. These activities are an expression  of their huge commitment and their strong emotional link with the BMW brand.Communication with the BMW Clubs on an equal footing is extremely  important for the BMW Group. In his congratulations on the  anniversary, Pieter Nota, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG  responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales, highlighted the importance  of the clubs for the living brand experience:“It is my honour to congratulate the BMW Clubs International Council  on its 40th anniversary. Our most valuable customers gather under this  umbrella: loyal enthusiasts of the BMW brand. In the past decades, an  internationally active community has been built with great passion. It  is characterized not only by the exchange of expertise, but also by  friendships developed beyond national borders. On behalf of BMW AG and  my fellow board members, I therefore wish you special congratulations  on the anniversary!”The foundation stone for the umbrella organisation of the BMW Clubs –  the BMW Clubs International Council – was laid at a meeting in Vienna  held in 1981. The Head of the Press Office at that time, Dr Horst  Avenarius, initiated this first step on behalf of BMW. The first  leadership duo comprised Dr Reiner Jodjohn from Germany as Chairman  and Keith Dempster from the USA as his Deputy. Since 2014, David de  Bruyn from South Africa has been President of the Council. Trevor Dean  from Australia, Dr Bernhard Knöchlein from Germany and Julio Reyes  from Guatemala currently provide him with support as Vice-Presidents.The international alignment expanded over the decades and this was  very evident at meetings right from the start with representatives  taking part from many countries including the USA, Canada, the United  Kingdom, Japan, Australia and of course Germany as well. Meanwhile,  international representatives from 16 umbrella organisations attend  the annual Council Meetings.Communication between the Clubs and the BMW Group has continued to  intensify as a result of global networking and the organisational  support provided by the BMW Club & Community Management (BCCM),  based at BMW Group Classic in Munich. The BCCM is a global interface  supporting the regional Clubs in arranging club life and organising  meetings and events.The BMW Clubs International Council is now the biggest network of  Clubs worldwide representing the brand of an automobile and motorcycle  manufacturer. With the exception of the Antarctic, the BMW Clubs  International Council can therefore proudly proclaim that on its 40th  anniversary, BMW Clubs exist virtually everywhere in the world.\n"}
{"prompt":"A 30-minute documentary describes the development of the first steering wheel in the world that works in both racing cars and simulators. ->","completion":" Munich. BMW M Motorsport and sim racing hardware manufacturer    Fanatec created a world first with the joint development of the    steering wheel for the BMW M4 GT3, which unites real-world and    virtual racing in an unprecedented way. The 30-minute documentary    “Fusion: Motorsport meets SIM racing” describes the pioneering work    in the development of the steering wheel, which works perfectly in    both racing cars and simulators, in detail – from the first idea    viewed with scepticsim, through the initial meetings and various    construction phases, to testing. The documentary is available on BMW    Motorsport YouTube via the following link: https:\/\/b.mw\/Fanatec_Steering_Wheel.It can also be watched on motorsport.tv, several European,    Asian ans Australian TV channels and on the inflight entertainment    systems of around 130 different airlines – including Lufthansa,    Singapore Airlines and Etihad. The film starts with the world debut of the BMW M4 GT3 steering wheel  at the BMW SIM Live event at BMW Welt in Munich (GER) in December  2020. Getting to the point of BMW works driver Philipp Eng (AUT)  performing a live demonstration of the steering wheel in action in  both a racing car and the simulator was the result of many months of  intensive development – and the time of the major endurance tests on  the racetrack is yet to come. All of the project’s protagonists are given their say in the  documentary, including Head of BMW SIM Racing Rudolf Dittrich and  Fanatec CEO Thomas Jackermeier, as well as the engineers responsible  for the BMW M4 GT3 and the steering wheel, and BMW works drivers and  professional sim racers. Everyone involved creates a very good feel  for the obstacles that needed to be overcome and how well the  collaboration between all the departments had to work to get the  desired end result. When you start the playback you accept the necessary cookies for YouTubePlayer.On our cookie information page you can set or revoke cookies permanently and find more information about our cookie usage.        var activateIframe561707 = function(force) {      var ID = '561707';    var processingId = 'YouTubePlayer';    var aspectRatio = 560 \/ 314;              if (!force) {       var articleWidth = $('#article-text').width();       $('#epaas_iframe_placeholder_'+ID).width(articleWidth).height(articleWidth\/aspectRatio);      $('#epaas_iframe_placeholder_loading_'+ID).width(articleWidth).height(articleWidth\/aspectRatio);      $('#epaas_iframe_wrapper_'+ID).width(articleWidth).height('auto');     }      if (force || epaas.api.isUsageAllowed(processingId)) {      console.log(\"ePaaS: article iframe - activating \" + processingId);      var articleIFrame = $('#epaas_iframe_' + ID);      articleIFrame.attr(\"src\", articleIFrame.attr(\"data-src\"));      $('#epaas_iframe_placeholder_loading_'+ID).hide();      $('#epaas_iframe_wrapper_'+ID).show();      $('#epaas_iframe_placeholder_'+ID).hide();    }    else {      console.log(\"ePaaS: article iframe - not allowed: \" + processingId);      $('#epaas_iframe_placeholder_loading_'+ID).hide();      $('#epaas_iframe_placeholder_'+ID).show();    }          };    addToEpaasIframeActivation(activateIframe561707, 'YouTubePlayer');    var activateId = '#epaas_iframe_placeholder_561707_activate';  $(activateId).click(function() { activateEpaasIframesByProcessing('YouTubePlayer'); return false; });“With unprecedented collaboration, the BMW M Motorsport and Fanatec  engineers developed a steering wheel like none ever seen before in the  history of racing,” said Dittrich. “They showed courage, pioneering  spirit and creativity, and raised the connection between real-world  motorsport and sim racing to a totally new level in the process. I’d  like to thank everyone involved. I’m delighted that this development  process is being portrayed superbly in this documentary. The film  highlights how seriously BMW SIM Racing takes its 360-degree approach,  and with how much vigour hardware developments and technological  innovations are expedited.” Thomas Jackermeier said: “For Fanatec, the collaboration with BMW M  Motorsport is a bold and important step in the company’s development.  For the first time, we designed a steering wheel that can be used not  only in the sim rig, but also in a real-life racing car. With all our  experience we felt ready for this project, and the tests so far prove  that we have done a good job. Seeing our steering wheel in action for  the first time in the BMW M4 GT3 shakedown gave me goose bumps – and  watching the documentary did as well.”\n"}

The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team enters the finishing    straight in the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in    South America. ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’ in San Juan, Argentina,    hosts the penultimate event of the season this weekend (15th to 17th    October). This is the first of the two overseas events, with which    the season draws to a close. The finale will take place from 19th to    21st November in Mandalika, Indonesia. BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’s regular rider Tom Sykes (GBR) is  continuing his recovery following his accident in Barcelona (ESP) and  will not be racing in Argentina. Sykes explained: “I have many things to say and many people to thank  for many reasons and I will do this in the very near future on a  personal level to give more detail. But for now I just need to speak  on behalf of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and I want to say that my  recovery has been incredible and I am at the position to be ready to  go back to my passion that is racing. Unfortunately given the timing  of these back to back races and the fly away in Argentina it just left  us going there with a couple of questions, so unfortunately we had to  make an early decision which meant we have to be out for one more  round. It is hard for me because I have missed more races in the last  four weeks than I have missed in my 21 years of racing. The main thing  is we are looking at the return to racing and look to enjoy the last  round of the WorldSBK championship. Thanks again to all, it is really  appreciated. Tom.” Next to Michael van der Mark (NED), Eugene Laverty (IRL) will again  line up on the BMW M 1000 RR for the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team in San  Juan. The province of San Juan is located in the west of Argentina,  roughly 180 kilometres north of Mendoza. With the 4.276-kilometre  ‘Circuito San Juan Villicum’, it is one of the country’s motorsport  centres. WorldSBK also visited San Juan in 2018 and 2019. Quotes ahead of the San Juan races. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  successful weekend in Portimão gives us a lot of momentum for the  final phase of the season. The team’s maiden victory in the Superpole  race was just one aspect, as we saw that Michael was also in  contention for a place on the podium in the two main races. We want to  back that up, although we are well aware that different and new  challenges now await us in Argentina and Indonesia. However, we have  confirmed that we are heading in the right direction, and we want to  continue that way. We are sorry that Tom will not be with us in  Argentina, but we fully understand his decision to miss the races.  Health always takes top priority. Our thanks go to Eugene, who is  ready and will stand in for him again in San Juan.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We are pleased to be going back to Argentina for our first  overseas event of the season. We are ready to fight for the podium  again after a successful Portimão event. The team is well prepared.  Once again, due to the recovery of Tom, Eugene will step in at this  event. Hopefully, Eugene can pick up on his positions at Portimão. He  did a very good job there and has a good experience at the San Juan  circuit so he should be ready for the weekend. Mickey came away from  Portugal with strong finishes. I think his confidence is on a high,  the bike is working well for him and he also knows the San Juan  circuit well. So overall, we feel that we are in a good position. It  goes without saying that we really hope that Tom can get back soon and  finish the season with the team. It is a shame that he could not make  it to Argentina but we fully understand the circumstances regarding  being in a fit condition to be able to travel overseas.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Personally I enjoy the San Juan track. It has a bit of  everything, but there are a lot of tight corners, a lot of  combinations and I am looking forward to going there. I think the  organisation and Dorna did a fantastic job to make it happen. It is a  World Championship and it is nice to go overseas and to go to  Argentina. I think that already at Jerez, we started to make steps  with the bike with some different set-up and we did a similar thing in  Portimão which worked out really well. We were a bit unlucky with the  crash in race one and a mechanical problem in race two but it seems  that with the change we made on the bike, we can be really more  competitive. It is always a question mark how it will go on a  different track but at least we go there with a lot of confidence and  knowing we can try a lot more things with the set-up now.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Firstly  I must say a big well done to Dorna and all the teams for making this  Argentinian round happen. This is the first time that we’ve travelled  outside of Europe since the global pandemic really took hold 18 months  ago and that’s a sure sign of progress. I really enjoy the Villicum  circuit layout and I’ve enjoyed good results here in previous years.  We made progress last time out at Portimão finishing in the top 10 in  all three races and slowly but surely the bike is beginning to feel  more like my bike. We’ll continue working on the chassis set-up to  improve braking and turning during Friday practice as we aim to make  another step closer towards fighting for that top 6 this weekend.”  Track Facts San Juan.Circuit        length4.276          km – anti-clockwiseCorners17 – 7 right-handers, 10 left-handersPole        positionRightLongest        straightApprox. 850 metresGrip levelExtremely lowTrack        layoutMainly slow corners, stop&go characterStrain on        brakesMediumAmount at full        throttle29 %Top speed \/ lowest        speed312          km\/h \/ 61 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityT10, T15Key        factorsConfidence in the bike, engine performance,          brake stability\n"}

The    historic BMW M Motorsport endurance legends also provided some very    special eye candy. DTM: Marco Wittmann ends the year fourth overall in the BMW M6    GT3’s farewell season.It was a visibly happy Marco Wittmann (GER) who emerged from the  Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M6 GT3 after the 16th and final race of the  DTM season. Seventh place in his home race at the Norisring was a  successful end to what has, on the whole, been an extremely successful  season. He finished fourth in the championship, with 171 points, two  wins, two pole positions and five podiums to his name. “Finishing  seventh was a satisfactory way to end the season. We were not  expecting that before the race, so I am really happy,” said Wittmann.  “I can be particularly pleased with fourth place overall in the  championship. For me, the highs and the victories this season  definitely outweigh anything else. The performances we gave this year  were huge.” As well as Wittmann, ROWE Racing drivers Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)  and Timo Glock (GER) also raced in the DTM in the farewell season for  the BMW M6 GT3, which will be replaced by the new BMW M4 GT4 in 2022.  They finished eleventh and 17th in the Drivers’ Championship. BMW M2 Cup: Inaugural season a total success.The BMW M2 Cup crowned the champion of its inaugural season at the  Norisring. Louis Henkefend (GER) won three races and scored a total of  177 points in the #17 BMW M2 CS Racing. “I am incredibly happy! That  is a big load off my mind,” said Henkefend. “Thank you to everyone who  has supported me throughout the years. This title means an awful lot  to me.” The goal of the BMW M2 Cup is to offer talented young drivers the  opportunity to prove themselves and go head-to-head on a big stage in  identical cars at the highest technological level. This goal was well  and truly achieved. “It was fantastic to be there live at the  Norisring for the finale of this season’s BMW M2 Cup, and to  experience the magnificent atmosphere in Nuremberg. That is motorsport  at its best,” said Thomas Felbermair, Vice President Sales and  Marketing BMW M GmbH. “Congratulations to Louis Henkefend on winning  the Driver title in the inaugural season of our new one-make cup with  the BMW M2 CS Racing. His consistently strong displays make him a  worthy champion. It was a great pleasure to see him and all the other  drivers racing against each other at such a high level over the course  of the season. The performances of the many talented young racers are  confirmation that we were spot on with the alignment of our BMW M2  Cup. Thank you to tolimit for organising and implementing the racing  season, as well as all the partners for their support. I can hardly  wait for the second season next year.” DTM Trophy: Ben Green wins title showdown in the BMW M4 GT4.Britain’s Ben Green, in a BMW M4 GT4 run by FK Performance  Motorsport, won the title in the DTM Trophy in a truly nail-biting  finale. He led his closest rival William Tregurtha (GBR, Mercedes) by  just six points going into the final race on Sunday. Fittingly, the  two title contenders ended up battling it out amongst themselves for  the race win and with it the title. It was Green who eventually  emerged triumphant, winning the race and defending the top spot in the  overall standings. In total, Green won five races over the course of  the season. Michael Schrey and Theo Oeverhaus (both GER) each one won  race in the BMW M4 GT4. They ended the season fifth and sixth in the  Drivers’ Championship. FK Performance Motorsport also won the Team  title with 268 points. In the Manufacturers Championship, BMW was  victorious with 302 points. BMW M Motorsport endurance legends thrill the crowds.One of the biggest favourites with the crowds in the Norisring  paddock were the BMW M Motorsport endurance legends. BMW Group Classic  presented some of the most spectacular and iconic BMW race cars,  offering a taste of things to come when BMW M Motorsport enters the  LMDh class from the 2023 season. Fans were able to admire and watch  the following cars in action as they took to the track for a number of  show runs: a replica of the 1973 BMW 3.0 CSL, the BMW M1 ‘Münchner  Wirte’ from 1981, the 1992 BMW M3 E30, the BMW McLaren F1 GTR Long  Tail from 1997, the BMW V12 LMR from 1999, and the 2015 BMW Z4 GT3. At  the wheel of the cars were Peter Oberndorfer (GER), Prinz Leopold von  Bayern (GER), Johnny Cecotto (VEN), Peter Kox (NED), Marc Hessel  (GER), Bruno Spengler (CAN) and BMW M Managing Director Markus Flasch. “It was fantastic to be back at the Norisring after two years, and to  see the fantastic fans, some of whom had come here specially to meet  me,” said Spengler. “It was very special to drive the BMW Z4 GT3, with  which I contested the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps alongside Alex  Zanardi and Timo Glock in 2015, in front of this great backdrop. That  is a really cool car, which is great fun to drive.” \n"}

Kenny Foray    (FRA) was on standby as the third rider. Victory secured second    place in the championship standings in the 2021 FIM EWC for the BMW    Motorrad World Endurance Team.  Success in the FIM EWC came just one week after the first victory in  the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) for the BMW Motorrad  WorldSBK Team. Reiterberger, Mikhalchik and Foray qualified second to  secure a good start position for the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. The turmoil at the start initially saw Mikhalchik drop back to sixth  place, however he was soon able to work his way back towards the front  of the field through a combination of speed and skill. After 15  minutes of racing, Mikhalchik was running second. Shortly after that,  he moved to the head of the field on the #37 BMW M 1000 RR and set  about opening a lead.

The #7 Yamaha from the YART team was closing all the time, however  Reiterberger kept a cool head, used all his skill, paced the race  perfectly and defended the lead to take the team’s maiden victory.  After six hours of racing, and a real thriller, he took the chequered  flag with a lead of just 0.070 seconds. 2021 was the second season in the FIM EWC for the BMW Motorrad World  Endurance Team. The new BMW M 1000 RR was used for the first time this  year. The team finished third in the first two races, at Le Mans (FRA)  and Estoril (POR). In race three, the Bol d’Or at Le Castellet (FRA),  they were forced to retire with a technical issue. The acclaimed  maiden victory came just a few weeks later in Most.  Quotes after the race at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Congratulations to the team, Werner Daemen and the riders on  their fantastic victory in Most. The race was a thriller, just as the  whole season has been extremely exciting. We have experienced  impressive fightbacks, podiums and setbacks this year. After the Bol  d’Or, we were no longer in contention for the title, however it was  clear that the team would give it their all in the final race here in  Most. We looked very good in the test and backed that form up in the  race. We knew that we had the pace to finish on the podium. To take  victory at the end of such a close race is simply fantastic. It was a  fantastic job from Ilya and Reiti, who was so impressive in bringing  home the win, and the whole team, which worked perfectly in the  garage. That is a great way to end the season. We will keep working  and know that we still have a lot of challenges ahead of us. However,  this is a great basis, we have a superb team, and we now head into the  winter and preparations for 2022 with great motivation.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “I am overjoyed. This weekend has been perfect from the word  go. Together with the YART team, we were always first and second, in  all the practice sessions and qualifying. To win the race by 0.07  seconds after six hours of racing is a dream. It is simply excellent,  and I know how much work we have all invested in this success. Despite  the races at Le Mans and Estoril not running entirely smoothly, we  still finished on the podium. We then retired with a technical issue  in the Bol d’Or, but these things can happen. Despite this, we still  managed to finish the season in second place in the championship. I am  proud of our riders and I am proud of the fact that we have taken all  those involved and formed a team capable of challenging for the championship.” Markus Reiterberger: “I think that was a really  breathtaking race to the chequered flag. Ilya was on the bike at the  start. He overtook everyone in the first stint and we took the lead.  We fancied a five-stop strategy, but for that to work you need a  safety car. That is very probable at this track, and that is exactly  what happened. We managed to make one stop fewer than YART, for  example. I think fuel consumption was the key to success today, and  the fact that we rode flawlessly. I gave it everything in my last  stint and rode against the clock. That was very tough, because Marvin  Fritz was really pushing behind me. It was really very close, but I  did it. I am grateful that we have finally won, as the whole team has  more than earned it. This is the reward for the huge amount of hard  work. Thank you to the team, BMW and everyone who has supported us.  This is a really nice way to end the season.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am so happy. We got our first win  and it’s really an amazing feeling, especially after the bad luck we  had at the Bol d’Or. Now we are also second in the world championship  and this gives us extra motivation. The race was almost perfect  because in the last two hours I was nearly 30 minutes behind the  safety car and afterwards I was struggling a bit with the tyres and it  was not easy to get back to a fast pace. In the last 50 minutes Markus  did a great job. He rode a really fast pace. We won the race, even if  it was with a very small gap. It is an amazing feeling and I want to  say thank you to the entire team, to my family, everyone – I am just happy.” Kenny Foray: “It was a fantastic race from my  team-mates and from my team. I came here on Monday, I did not know the  track and my job was just to help the team whenever there is a  problem. Of course, I would have liked to ride in the race, but my  team-mates did a fantastic job. I am really happy for them, for the  team and for BMW. The first win is a great result for us. I am also  happy because I rode three races this season and we finished second in  the world championship and it is always great to end a season like  this. So a big thank you goes to my team.” \n"}
{"prompt":" The BMW Group is developing new working environments for around 70,000 associates worldwide  Flexible working enables a modern work-life balance  Working on-site remains a key success factor   ->","completion":" Munich, 8 October 2021 – Flexible, individual,  sustainable – that is how BMW Group working environments will be  organised. The company is gradually developing a future-oriented  working environment for about 70,000 associates worldwide in around  400 office buildings in more than 40 countries. Under the name  ConnectedWorks, the BMW Group is continuing a process it began back in  2017: For example, at the Research and Innovation Centre (FIZ) in  Munich, new working models are being created that offer every team a  variety of options for combining digital, location-independent formats  with flexible, individually configured forms of on-site cooperation.  The aim is always to achieve the best work results.Experience during the coronavirus pandemic has shown that the BMW  Group is on the right track. Speed and location independence have  proved to be important attributes of digital remote working – but they  cannot replace personal exchange between colleagues. It also became  clear during the challenges of the coronavirus, that innovations, team  creativity and a feeling of belonging develop best on-site. Now that  more in-person meetings and professional exchange are possible again,  the challenge lies in combining the best of both worlds. For the BMW  Group, the question of how to work together on the future of mobility  is not just about how many days people work in the office or at other  locations. It is about much more than that: The central idea is how  BMW Group associates can perform complex integrated tasks to the best  of their abilities.                   One element of this is mobile working. Thanks to this development,  associates have been able to organise their day-to-day work flexibly  in agreement with their managers since 2013 – making the BMW Group a  leader for the whole industry. “Ideas and innovations mainly come from  personal exchange. That is why attractive working environments are a  key success factor for us – complemented by hybrid and digital  cooperation models,” says Ilka Horstmeier, member of the Board of  Management of BMW AG responsible for Human Resources. ConnnectedWorks supports modern vehicle development What this might look like in practice can be seen in the working  environments at the FIZ in Munich, the heart of the BMW Group’s  research and development network. Today’s modern vehicle development  is a complex, integrated activity. For several years now, the BMW  Group has been committed to bringing together associates from  different areas of the company to work together in interdisciplinary,  cross-functional teams. More than 22,000 associates currently work at  FIZ under one roof. Interaction is encouraged: Newly designed team  spaces facilitate communication and enable staff from different  disciplines to work together. Short lines of communication, with  low-threshold, cross-cutting opportunities for interaction create a  space for innovation at the FIZ Tech Campus. Working together on-site  and in-person is crucial – and the rapid growth in digital formats  makes places for collaboration increasingly important. The BMW Group’s  workplace strategy therefore deliberately focuses on the layout and  providing a place that facilitates collaboration and idea-sharing.  More than 30% of office spaces worldwide have already been converted.  Alongside team spaces that encourage communication and interaction,  there are also spaces associates can retreat to for concentrated  working, as well as areas where they can recuperate and connect. In  this way, the BMW Group is reinforcing its sustainable area  management, while helping associates achieve optimal work results and  strengthening its corporate culture. The flexible working environments  are supplemented by seamless integration of digital options for  location-independent cooperation.In the future, office spaces will be geared even more towards  associates’ needs. For instance, the IT Centre project at the Munich  location was supported by associates as part of an analysis of working  methods. This analysis phase is central to implementation of the  workplace strategy. The information obtained forms the basis for the  planning and implementation phase. In this way, the BMW Group is able  to ensure spaces are optimally tailored to the needs of each business  department and their work demands. It is all about offering associates  the perfect environment for their job and preferred method of working. Learning from and with one anotherConnectedWorks is not a rigid concept; it is a mindset that can be  actively shaped by managers and associates. Each team discusses on an  individual basis which combination of in-person working and digital  exchange can best achieve their goals.So everyone involved can learn from and with one another, the BMW  Group invites staff to share experiences between countries on an  internal community platform. It also highlights best practices and  provides information on the range of training courses and methods  available. The BMW Group is already committed to an open approach  characterised by respectful cooperation and a genuine feeling of  community. With ConnectedWorks, the company is taking the next step  towards making day-to-day work even more connected and agile. If you have any questions, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsAngela Konert, BMW Group, spokesperson Human ResourcesTelephone: +49-89-382-50591, angela.konert@bmw.deMarkus Sagemann, BMW Group, head of Communications Human Resources,  Corporate CitizenshipTelephone: +49-89-382-68796, markus.sagemann@bmw.de The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

{"prompt":"The unique car in the unmistakable style of Joshua Vides and an exclusive merchandising collection presented at [SPACE] by BMW in Los Angeles. ->","completion":" Los Angeles. BMW M is immersing itself in the young  and diverse Los Angeles art scene, having started a new collaboration  with Joshua Vides and the BMW X4 M Competition (combined fuel  consumption: 10.8 – 10.7 l\/100 km according to WLTP; combined  CO2emissions: 247 – 238 g\/km according to WLTP). This collaboration  with the internationally renowned artist from the USA, whose works  play with the perception of objects as a sketch and blur the  boundaries between drawing and reality, has produced a hand-painted  BMW X4 M Competition, its dynamism emphasised thanks to Joshua Vides’  unmistakable style and application of black lines on a white  background. The son of Guatemalan immigrants has been a great fan of  the BMW brand since childhood. For him, this collaboration represents  the fulfilment of a long-cherished dream.The global premiere of the BMW X4 M Competition x Joshua Vides took  place at the exclusive showroom [SPACE] by BMW in The Grove in Los  Angeles. This also hosted a merchandising collection dedicated to BMW  and BMW M designed by Joshua Vides. He is selling a limited edition of  the collection through his own channels this year. Pro-skateboarder  Ishod Wair, who is also a great BMW M enthusiast, posed for the  catalogue with the car. This collection also includes items of  clothing such as t-shirts and hoodies, as well as everyday items like  thermos cups, and even interior decoration products like carpets – all  featuring logos in the style of Joshua Vides. On the evening before  the official premiere, the artist had celebrated an exclusive sneak  preview of the BMW X4 M Competition x Joshua Vides at [SPACE] by BMW  with family and friends. The unique car was presented there to  selected guests on 7th October as part of a preview with works by  Joshua Vides. The vehicle will be available for viewing by the general  public from 8th October, before it is transferred to the BMW M GmbH  vehicle fleet in November.“As the BMW brand continues to develop, we are always open to  cultural developments as well,” said Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice  President Customer and Brand BMW: “With his ideas and his vision,  Joshua Vides is one of the outstanding figures and opinion leaders in  the world of art, lifestyle and culture. The collaboration with JV  will see BMW benefit from his influence and his pictures by reaching  and captivating new target groups.” Markus Flasch, CEO BMW M GmbH,  emphasised that this is “the very first time that a High Performance  Sports Activity Vehicle from BMW M acts as the focal point for one of  our exclusive collaboratons.” Josh has understood how to use his  artistic talents to provide the perfect setting for the design and the  lines of this vehicle. “His incomparable style addresses young  consumers all around the world and strengthens the BMW M brand  consciousness in the expressive luxury segment,” said Markus Flasch.Joshua Vides: “I am extremely happy to have been able to work with  BMW and BMW M in this project. Ever since I was about seven or eight  years old, I have wanted to own a BMW. It was just unbelievable to be  able to apply my own ideas to the design of a BMW X4 M Competition.”  His aim for the project: “I wanted the car to look as great as  possible on the stand. This is the first time I have worked with speed  lines like the ones you see giving the impression of fast movement in  cartoons or films. “I am very pleased with the result.“Joshua Vides has been a true BMW enthusiast since childhood. He grew  up in a deprived suburb of Los Angeles, where he seldom caught a  glimpse of a BMW or BMW M vehicles. In fact, it was so rare that  seeing a BMW drive past was enough to make him stop and think. His  fascination with the brand continued to grow, as did his desire to buy  his own BMW one day. After an extremely varied career path saw Joshua  Vides working as barista, fireman, glazier, delivery driver, then as a  graphic designer for a range of streetwear labels – he found his  vocation as an artist. He made his breakthrough by producing artistic  decoration for a world-famous sports shoe, which then led to  collaboratons with globally renowned companies and to his own collections.In 2021, Joshua Vides opened his Matte Black Coffee cafe in Los  Angeles, designed entirely in his black-and-white style. Visitors to  the cafe will be able to admire his installation dedicated to BMW for  some weeks – this consists of spinning steering wheels and other works  of art.Joshua Vides has now fulfilled his childhood dream of owning a BMW –  not once, but twice. In addition to an alpine white BMW M3 E46, which  he purchased in 2004, he also owns a diamond black 1989 BMW M3 E30.  His love for BMW is now etched on his skin; while making his first  trip to Munich in September, he visited BMW Welt to admire the  treasures from the BMW Classic area and was so impressed that he  decided to get a tattoo of the BMW logo on his forearm.\n"}

On the evening of October 7, 2021, the winner  of the Preis der Nationalgalerie was announced at Hamburger Bahnhof –  Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin. Celebrating its 50th anniversary this  year, the BMW Group Cultural Engagement supports the Preis der  Nationalgalerie for over 15 years now.The jury, consisting of Emre Baykal, chief curator,  Arter, Istanbul; Sven Beckstette, curator at  Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin; Gabriele  Knapstein, director, Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart  – Berlin; Emma Lavigne, president, Palais de Tokyo,  Paris and Yesomi Umolu, director curatorial affairs  and public practice, Serpentine Galleries, London, decided after  intense discussions on Sandra Mujinga (born 1989 in Goma, Democratic  Republic of the Congo) as the prize winner. With the award Mujinga  wins a major solo exhibition next year in one of the Nationalgalerie’s  institutions as well as an accompanying publication.“The jury has decided to award this year’s Preis der Nationalgalerie  to Sandra Mujinga. Sandra Mujinga works across a variety of media,  with her presentation at Hamburger Bahnhof placing a focus on her  sculptural practice. On the one hand, the works display a great  sensibility for craft and materiality. Yet, with them, Mujinga is also  able to reconcile contradictory experiences: ostensibly familiar forms  disappear before we are able to grasp them; her spectral figures  appear ominous, but also seem to offer their protection; although  static, they exhibit an inherent dynamism; and they are both finished,  but also seemingly in a state of becoming. Her negotiation of these  contradictions opens up a space for imagination on the part of the  viewer. The topics addressed by her works resonate greatly with the  present moment, while also seeming to come from a future already  passed. They remind us to be considerate of other living beings for  the sake of our own survival, and that we can observe and learn from  their various strategies of adapting to an ever-changing world”,    stated the jury in its unanimous decision.“Since 2013, after being awarded the Preis der Nationalgalerie,  Marianna Castillo Deball, Anne Imhof, Agnieszka Polska, and Pauline  Curnier Jardin have come up with incredibly impressive presentations  for the Hamburger Bahnhof. I would like to give my sincerest thanks to  the members of the jury for today’s lively discussion and congratulate  Sandra Mujinga, whose exhibition we will now spend the coming year  preparing,” stated Dr Gabriele Knapstein, head of Hamburger    Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart – Berlin.Dr Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,  Finance, said about the newly announced winner, “Looking at  past nominees and their later careers, the significance of the  shortlist has become very clear. As long-standing partner, we would  like to warmly congratulate Sandra Mujinga as this year’s winner. We  are very much looking forward to her upcoming exhibition.”In addition to Sandra Mujinga, the shortlisted artists for this  year’s Preis der Nationalgalerie included Calla Henkel & Max  Pitegoff, Sung Tieu and Lamin Fofana. Their works will be presented as  part of a group exhibition at Hamburger Bahnhof – Museum für Gegenwart  – Berlin until February 27, 2022.

We set the fastest qualifying lap of the entire field, which is  something I am very proud of. We have consistently improved the bike,  which is now in very good condition, both for a flying lap and over  the full race distance. I really like the track in Most. It is very  cool, but the conditions are superb for fast laps. We are excellently  equipped for the race. We hope we get off to a good start, that the  weather plays ball, and that we get through the race without any  problems. Then we will really have a chance to challenge for the win.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am happy with the qualifying  sessions. We made a small step from Q1 to Q2. It was my first time  usng really soft tyres and I found a good feeling but we did not have  so many laps so I was careful with the tyres. It was enough to be  among the top and I took P2 in my group. The feeling on the bike is  good, also with the race tyres, so it looks like we are ready for the  race. So let’s have fun and try to fight for the top in the final race  of the season.” Kenny Foray: “Already now, I feel very good on the  bike. For sure, I missed some laps to be really confident. In Q2, my  pace was not so bad with the race tyre and I am happy for that. It was  not possible to improve with the qualifying tyre because there was too  much traffic and the feeling was not quite there but I think P2 is  good and I am confident for the race because the bike is working  really well and the pace is good.” \n"}

Through his work within the National Geographic  project “Pristine Seas”, however, the imminent thawing of the Arctic  threatens to open new marine routes which, without prevention, will  cross into these areas. Manu San Félix: A life dedicated to    preserving the oceansIn addition to being a renowned marine biologist whose project with  Posidonia meadows has led him to make reports for UNESCO, San Félix is  a photographic reporter awarded in 2004 (London) with the Wildlife  Photographer of the Year and in 2005 (Antibes, France ) with the World  Underwater Festival.Since 2009 he has been working for National Geographic as Underwater  Image Director for the Pristine    Seas project, participating in 35 expeditions around the world. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsSarah Bauer, Press Spokesperson Product Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-94180E-mail: sarah.bauer@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

{"prompt":"New process from Lilac Solutions focuses on sustainable extraction, efficiency and costs ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is stepping up its expansion of  electromobility and will be releasing about ten million fully-electric  vehicles onto the roads over the next ten years or so. By 2030, at  least half the BMW Group’s global sales are expected to come from  fully-electric vehicles. This will also increase the need for lithium,  an important raw material for production of battery cells.To promote environmentally-friendly, resource-efficient extraction of  lithium, the BMW Group is investing, through its venture capital fund,  BMW i Ventures, in an innovative process developed by US startup Lilac  Solutions. Lilac Solutions has developed and patented an ion exchange  technology that will significantly improve efficiency, costs and  sustainability by extracting lithium from brine resources, which are  natural deposits of salt water.“Innovative technologies provide better, more sustainable and more  efficient access to raw materials. By investing in startups, we are  speeding up development of new technologies, stimulating competition  and providing impetus that will make it easier for young companies to  access the market,” said Wolfgang Obermaier, Senior Vice President  Indirect Goods and Services, Raw Materials, Production Partners at the  BMW Group. “By investing in Lilac Solutions, we are supporting  technological progress in the field of lithium extraction, with a  focus on responsible and sustainable methods.”Lilac Solutions has developed a new ion exchange technology to make  mining lithium from brine resources more efficient and cost-effective.  The company seeks to significantly reduce environmental impact  compared to conventional methods, while, at the same time, protecting  local communities and ecosystems. The technology has already been  proven in initial field pilots and must now demonstrate that it can be  scaled and industrialised in the mid-term. The process could then be  used with brines worldwide, even if they have a low lithium content. BMW Group provides battery cell manufacturers with responsibly    extracted lithiumThe BMW Group has made sustainability and resource efficiency central  to the company’s strategic direction. A key aspect here is compliance  with environmental and social standards in the supply chain.  Eliminating infringements of human rights and environmental standards  presents a particular challenge in the case of critical raw materials  – as is the case with lithium. For this raw material, BMW Group  Purchasing has implemented therefore additional measures and is  sourcing lithium directly from the mines and making it available to  battery cell suppliers. In this way, the company creates complete  transparency about the origin and mining methods of the material.\n"}

For the fifth consecutive year, BMW  and Frieze continue their long-term partnership with the major art  initiative BMW Open Work by Frieze. Drawing  inspiration from BMW engineering the project brings together art,  technology and design in pioneering multi-platform formats. The artist  selected by curator Attilia Fattori Franchini to create the latest  edition of BMW Open Work by Frieze is the Los Angeles-based    Madeline Hollander, who introduced the commission  through an interactive digital platform and livery intervention on BMW  i3 electric vehicles during Frieze Week 2020, and will present a live,  site-specific installation in the BMW Lounge at Frieze London in 2021.  As in previous years, BMW will also provide the VIP shuttle service  transporting the fair’s VIP guests with the new all electric BMW iX.Working with performance, film and installation, Hollander explores  how the human body in motion negotiates its limits within everyday  systems of technology and engineering, industrial apparatus,  intellectual property and daily rituals. Her performances and  installations present perpetually looping events that intervene within  spatial, psychological and temporal landscapes, and engage with novel  modes of viewership. Titled “Sunrise\/Sunset” the  project continues the artist's recent research into traffic patterns  and working without human actors to depict unseen systems or  processes. Emerging from an inspiring dialogue with the department  responsible for sustainability at BMW Group and investigation into the  automatic adaptive system of BMW headlights, Hollander created for  Frieze London 2021, a site-specific, and self-sufficient, live  installation composed of one hundred  recycled BMW LED headlights from  the BMW Group Recycling and Dismantling Centre. Thus, the artist  developed an energetic loop, a networked map choreographed by the  sunsets and sunrises across the globe. Fascinated by the responsive  nature of headlights technology which reacts to a number of factors  such as movement, light and weather conditions, the artist synced each  headlight to different time zones creating a live and ceaseless global  clock. In Hollander’s work our apparently erratic individual actions  and everyday technologies synchronically align, becoming a collective,  and in this case cascading-dance. The installation is accompanied by  an original score created for the occasion by the composer    Celia Hollander.In addition to Madeline Hollander’s commission for BMW Open Work by  Frieze, Superblue and BMW i will present the world premiere of    “No One is an Island”, a collaboration between  Random International and Studio Wayne McGregor. “No One is an Island”  is fuelled by science and explores electrified movement steered by  advanced algorithms. It is a future-oriented reflection on how the  human mind empathises with artificial intelligence and automated  processes. The performance comprises sculptural, performative, and  musical aspects.The centrepiece is a sculpture by Random  International that experiments with the minimal amount of  information that is actually necessary for an animated form to be  recognised as human; and the fundamental impact created by subtle  changes within that information. As it transitions from robot to human  likeness, dancers from Company Wayne McGregor  interact with the sculpture in a live, kinetic performance, further  exploring the relationship between humans and technology and our  capacity to empathise with a machine. The dancer’s interventions  scored by Chihei Hatakeyama add a performative  dimension to the sculpture, re-translating and celebrating the  connection between human and mechanical movement. On the occasion of  Frieze London, the installation will be shown publicly  from October  13 to 16 daily between 3:00 and 7:00pm at Park Village Studios. To  visit, please register here.BMW Open Work by FriezeNow in its fifth year,  and curated by Attilia Fattori Franchini, BMW Open Work by  Frieze gives artists and researchers a platform to push the  boundaries of their work, starting the project with a creative  dialogue between arts, technology, engineering and design to pursue  their practice in innovative new directions. For its premier in 2017,  artist Olivia Erlanger integrated a motion-sensitive sculpture, audio  and immersive fog in her work “Body Electric”; in 2018, Sam Lewitt  engaged with BMW intellectual property and engine production to  conceptually and physically explore the production cycle of a BMW  engine in “CORE (the ‘Work’)”; in 2019, Camille Blatrix collaborated  with BMW Individual to explore the primal and emotional relationships  to labor and materiality, raising questions about functionality and  desire in the installation “Sirens”. For further questions please contact:Prof. Dr  Thomas Girst BMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Head of Cultural EngagementTelephone: +49 89 382  24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comDoris FleischerBMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Cultural EngagementTelephone: +49 89 328 27806Email:    Doris.Fleischer@bmw.dewww.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.de\n"}

Once again, Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR)    and Kenny Foray (FRA) will be in the saddle on the #37 BMW M 1000    RR. Xavi Forés (ESP) can’t particitpate at Most due to the shoulder    injury he suffered during free practice for the Bol d’Or at Le    Castellet (FRA). The famous 8 Hours of Suzuka in Japan had originally been scheduled  as the season finale, however the Coronavirus situation rendered that  impossible, prompting the FIM EWC to move the season finale to Most.  It will be appearing there at the weekend, together with the World  Touring Car Cup (FIA WTCR). Although Most is a new addition to the FIM  EWC calendar, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is familiar with  the circuit in the north-west of the Czech Republic from the  International German Motorcycle Championship (IDM), in which  Mikhalchik recently claimed his third championship title. The BMW  Motorrad World Endurance Team has been testing with the #37 M RR at  Most ahead of the finale. BMW Motorrad Motorsport also competed there  at the start of August in the FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). The two qualifying sessions will take place on Thursday 7th October.  The race starts on Saturday 9th October at 11:00 CEST. The race was  originally scheduled to last eight hours, however it was reduced to  six hours due to noise control regulations, and to ensure that the  riders would have sufficient daylight. As at every FIM EWC finale, the  number of points on offer is increased by 150 %, meaning that the  winner scores 45 points and pole position is worth five points. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team secured the third spot on the  podium in the first two races of the season at Le Mans (FRA) and  Estoril (POR). At race three at Le Castellet, the team was again  involved in the battle for the podium but was forced to retire early  due to a technical problem. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team is  heading to the finale in fifth position in the championship standings,  21 points behind second place. Quotes ahead of the season finale at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  finale will once again be really exciting with the intense six-hour  race at Most. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team has done some  outstanding work this season and has been one of the teams battling  for the world championship title. Retiring due to technical problems  at Le Castellet was certainly a setback, but that can always happen in  endurance racing – what we saw on more than one occasion at Le  Castellet. However, we still have the chance to reach the rostrum in  the overall world championship standings. A world championship podium  would be just reward for the entire team and for the riders, after all  their efforts in this project and I know that they will give their all  to round off the season with this success.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “Our objective at Most is pretty simple, we are going to try  to win there. We had some really good testing there and I hope that we  can turn those test results into race results. Our riders are  extremely motivated, the motorbike is perfect. We have all the  ingredients to reach the podium and also to aim for the win. We are  sorry that Xavi has to miss this race, and we all wish him a speedy recovery.” Markus Reiterberger: “Our testing at Most was good  and we are well set for the final six-hour sprint. I haven't been back  to Most for a long time and I will have to get to the know the circuit  again. I like it a lot and I am looking forward to the finale. It will  be a real sprint race. We did well during testing, the team has  prepared the bike well and I also think that the circuit suits our  Dunlop tyres. I hope that the weather is on our side, that we will  have another great race weekend and round off the season in a  successful way. The team has earned a reward for all the hard work and  I hope that we can manage it.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I know the Most track well and the  BMW M 1000 RR works well on that circuit. So our whole package is good  and we are ready. Six hours is like a sprint race and I think that we  will have a good fight with the other factory teams. We again want to  show our potential, enjoy the race and try to fight for the top again  at the final race of the season.” Kenny Foray: “First of all, I am very sorry for Xavi  and whish him a speedy recovery. So I stand in in the last moment, but  I am happy to discover a new track and I hope that I can help the team  to get a good result in the race and to finish the season on a high.” \n"}

The chequered flag for the Superpole race on Sunday    morning at Portimão (POR) was greeted with boundless celebrations in    the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team pit area. Michael van der Mark (NED)    won the race on his BMW M 1000 RR and the team celebrated the first    win for BMW Motorrad Motorsport since returning to the FIM Superbike    World Championship (WorldSBK). The result marks the next important    milestone for the project. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad,    was at Portimão for the race weekend and was the first to offer his congratulations. Van der Mark was already on fast form during the rainy warm-up  session, posting the best time on Sunday morning. The rain had stopped  in time for the Superpole race but the circuit had not dried out.  Starting from fifth on the grid, van der Mark had already moved up to  third by the end of lap one. He then passed Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR \/  Yamaha) and moved into second place on lap two. On the next lap, he  left Scott Redding (GBR \/ Ducati) behind to take the lead. Van der  Mark never looked likely to surrender his lead, claiming the  long-awaited first win after ten laps – fully 5.330 seconds ahead of  his rivals. Having won the Superpole race, van der Mark started the afternoon’s  second race from pole position. That race took place in sunny  conditions on a dry surface. However, a technical issue prevented him  from mounting a real attack and he completed the second race in sixth place. Eugene Laverty (IRL), racing in place of Tom Sykes (GBR) again at  Portimão, moved up from 13th on the grid to ninth position in the  Superpole race. In the afternoon’s second race, he crossed the line in  tenth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team  completed the Superpole race in 13th place, and then crossed the line  in 15th position in the afternoon’s second race. As the team will not  be competing in the two upcoming overseas events, these were Folger’s  last WorldSBK races of the season. The Italian privateer team B-Max Racing Team raced at Portimão with a  wildcard for rider Gabriele Ruiu (ITA). Ruiu finished 15th in the  Superpole race. He retired early from both main races over the weekend. The eleventh round of the season at Portimão marks the end of the  European season in the WorldSBK 2021. The racing continues in two  weeks with the penultimate event of the season in Argentina, while the  finale will take place in Indonesia in November. Quotes after race two at Portimão. Dr. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad: “It is  something special to secure the first win for a project like this. I  also think that we as a team have deserved this, and it shows that we  are heading in the right direction. We are all proud of this win,  which is an important step for the project that we are aiming to  develop gradually. Congratulations to Michael van der Mark, the entire  BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and everyone involved in this success. I  would like to thank them all for their efforts and their hard work.” Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “This  win is a real milestone for our project. It is just brilliant and I  would like to thank the entire team. Thanks to BMW Motorrad as well  for supporting this project. The conditions were pretty special this  morning with the wet surface. Mickey showed during the warm-up that he  is extremely fast and then produced a superb performance in the  Superpole race. We know that the motorbike also goes really well in  the wet. None of us will forget him crossing the line in a hurry. The  pole position then gave us the best starting position you can have for  the second race. Unfortunately, Mickey was struggling with an issue  but that cannot spoil our delight at his victory. Eugene was not so  happy with the motorbike in the wet this morning, but we were still  able to make progress for the Superpole race and he recorded another  two top-ten finishes. Overall, it was a really positive weekend for us.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “I am really, really happy for everyone in the project. We  have worked very, very hard to get into this position. We are  ambitious and we have proved that by the steps we have made over the  years. It is still very early in the project considering we lost  almost a year due to Covid. I am pleased for Mickey as well. To put  him back on the podium and then to win that race just gives him the  confidence and knowing we are going in the right direction. This  weekend we knew all along, from qualifying on. We had a good pace in  the wet and in the dry and I think that was the reward for him and the  whole team so I am really pleased for everybody. In race two, Mickey  made an okay start. We lost a few places but he was in the right group  but we had a technical issue in the middle of the race. At that point  he was second quickest on track and I think the podium for sure was in  sight, but with the circumstances, the wind conditions and everything,  we take that sixth position. For Eugene to stand in on the second  weekend in a row he did a fantastic job. To finish in the top-ten  against guys who have been racing in the championship for the full  season just shows the quality there so he has done exactly what we  expected from him. Overall, it has been a successful weekend. Now we  are heading overseas and we hope we can get Tom fit and ready for  Argentina and get the team back to full strength.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Yeah, it was a pretty good day. Of course, this morning it  was nice to get a win with the BMW M1000 RR. It was a good race and I  already felt good in the rain from this morning, and this carried  through into the race, even when it started to dry, I still had a good  feeling on the bike. I’m happy to take the win for BMW Motorrad and  the whole team. Race 2 I didn’t get a good start, but I felt I had  good pace but unfortunately we had some issues which cost me a lot of  time and then my race from there was a bit lonely as I couldn’t catch  up the guys in front. We have to learn, but at the end it was not a  bad Sunday.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was  an OK day, but I am not satisfied with the race results as I wanted to  be further up the field. We have tried to make the bike mine and we  did make some progress in the dry race this afternoon, but I still  couldn’t get the bike to load the front and have agility, so it was  tough to finish like that. The wet race was nice. I did struggle in  the first three laps to get heat into the rear tyre but once I got  some temperature in the tyre it was enjoyable, and we got a good  result from it.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It’s a case of  mixed emotions for me. On the one hand, I am sad to be leaving the  team. On the other hand, I am also a little bit relieved that a  difficult year is now over. The final race was not an easy one either,  as I had problems in the apex and when exiting corners. I couldn’t do  any proper slides out of the turn, as my slides were really  aggressive, so I just got it to the finish line. I would like to thank  the whole team. We moved up to the WorldSBK together this year. They  are all great people and we had a lot of fun together. I will  certainly remember the great moments and they will all have a place in  my heart.”  \n"}

A strong performance saw Michael van der Mark (NED)    from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team aim for the podium in Saturday’s    race at Portimão (POR). However, he was forced to retire six laps    from the end, having fallen after another rider hit his rear wheel.    Eugene Laverty (IRL), standing in for Tom Sykes (GBR) again at    Portimão, finished the first race in ninth place. Jonas Folger (GER)    from the Bonovo MGM Racing team was racing at Portimão for the first    time and crossed the line in 15th position. The Portuguese racetrack    is hosting the eleventh round of the FIM Superbike World    Championship 2021 (WorldSBK). In Superpole on Saturday morning, van der Mark claimed fifth place in  the second row of the grid, on his BMW M 1000 RR. Laverty was also  going well but fell after sliding during the closing stage of the  qualifying session. That prevented him from bettering the lap time  already posted and he finished in 13th place. Folger finished  Superpole in 19th position. Van der Mark initially fell back a few places at the start of the  first race. However, a great recovery performance saw him move back up  to swiftly become part of the chasing pack battling for the third spot  on the podium. However, his charge to the podium came to an end on lap  15 out of 20 when a rider touched his rear wheel on entry to turn  five, causing him to fall. Van der Mark got back up and re-joined but  was forced to head for the pits and retire. Laverty moved up into the  top ten at the start. As the race progressed, he fell back a little  but then found his rhythm, crossing the finish line in ninth place.  After 20 race laps, Folger secured 15th place to score one point. Quotes after race one at Portimão. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  made good progress in the third practice session this morning. Michael  gave an outstanding performance in qualifying. He often struggles with  the qualifying tyres and it was amazing to get him into fifth place.  Eugene had an unfortunate fall and had to be content with 13th place.  Mickey didn't get the start quite right and he was back in twelfth  place after the first few turns, but once again, he gave a very, very  good chasing performance. We were right in the battle for the podium.  Michael said that he would have made it and he had already moved into  an overtaking position. Unfortunately, Andrea Locatelli then touched  him from behind and caused the fall. That finished off the race for  him. It was a real shame as he was clearly in with a chance of  reaching the podium. So, we’ll start the Superpole race tomorrow from  P5 and then we’ll see what’s possible. Eugene rode a consistent race  and I am confident that he will be able to take another step forward  tomorrow at his home circuit.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Eugene did a good job today. He rode a good race and came  strong at the end which we know he can do. Superpole was difficult for  him and we didn’t get the Q tyre to work for him very well but in the  end, he did a good job so credit to Eugene for that performance. I am  still a bit lost for words on the Michael situation. Nevertheless, we  have to dust ourselves down and build Mickey up overnight and get him  ready for the Superpole race. We are clearly disappointed as we had  the podium in sight which is what I think we deserved this weekend.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning we changed a lot on the bike compared to  yesterday and I felt really good in FP3. In Superpole, I had a good  lap and I ended up starting in P5. That was a good step for us and I  was really happy with the starting position. During race one, I messed  up the start and got stuck in traffic at T1, so I lost a lot of  places. After that I had a good pace and was catching the group in  front of me. I managed to get past those guys and had some good  battles but unfortunately, I got taken out at T5 by Locatelli which  was a shame because we were fighting for the podium with Bautista and  Baz. But that is racing, and we try again tomorrow.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am  happy with that race result because we have been working progressively  forward all weekend. The guys did a fantastic job in making the bike  feel like my bike which made me feel like home. We qualified low but  had a fantastic first few corners and gained a lot of positions.  Unfortunately, we had a problem with the clutch at the start and had  issues in corner entry but once I got used to this problem, I settled  into a good rhythm and got a good result. Without this problem at the  beginning, I think we could have been higher up today.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Superpole and the  race were really difficult today. In Superpole, we were unable to make  use of the advantages the qualifying tyres normally bring.  Unfortunately, I made a bad start to the race from 19th on the grid. I  was playing catch-up for a long time and wasn’t able to build up a  good feel with the rear and front grip. I was struggling all through  the race. We did manage to score one point, as some riders ahead of us  took a tumble, but overall the race was rather disappointing.” \n"}
{"prompt":" BMW Group Plant Dingolfing pilots new paint process  Overspray-free paint application opens up a wide range of possibilities for customisation  Unique combination of customer benefits and sustainability  Technology boosts both resource and energy efficiency  ->","completion":"   BMW Group Plant Dingolfing pilots new paint  process  Overspray-free paint application opens up a wide range of  possibilities for customisation  Unique combination of customer  benefits and sustainability  Technology boosts both resource and  energy efficiency  Munich \/ Dingolfing. BMW Group Plant Dingolfing is  piloting a new overspray-free painting process that allows several  paint colours to be used and designs to be applied without stencils or  masking the vehicle. The highly innovative application method not only  increases the degree of individualisation for customers, but also  contributes to sustainability by reducing waste and energy  consumption. The technology is being used for the first time in 19 BMW  M4 Coupés, which will soon roll off the production line at Plant  Dingolfing with custom two-tone paintwork and M4 identification on the  bonnet and tailgate. Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,  responsible for Production: “We expect the highest standards of  efficiency, sustainability and digitalisation from our production.  This smart painting technology meets all the requirements for an  innovative production process and also offers unique customer benefits.” The BMW Group developed the new EcoPaintJet Pro application process  for waterborne base coats and 2K clear coat in collaboration with  mechanical and plant engineering firm Dürr. In the conventional  procedure, paint is atomised by a rotating bell with 35 to 55,000  revolutions per minute and adheres electrostatically to the body. The  new method works without electrostatics, relying instead on jet  application. The paint is applied using an orifice plate that enables  high edge definition with a variable paint thickness of between 1 and  appr. 50 millimetres. This requires maximum precision from both the  robot and application technology. It also means two different colours  of paint can be used, e.g. for a contrasting roof, and stripes and  other designs applied – for instance, on the bonnet. The focus of  technology and material development was on achieving the maximum range  of applications. It will now be possible to paint every exterior  component – offering customers virtually limitless options for individualisation. Until now, custom designs like this can only be realised using manual  masking. With the new technology, the material and personnel costs  this previously entailed will be eliminated, making it possible to  realize these options at a lower cost. This innovative process also  prevents so-called overspray, i.e. excess paint particles, which  therefore no longer has to be disposed of. A further contribution to  sustainable production comes from lower energy consumption: Since  paint separation is no longer required, the amount of air needed is  also lower. At around 7,000 operating hours, this results in energy  savings of more than 6,000 megawatt hours and reduces the carbon  footprint by nearly 2,000 tonnes per year. Development of innovative  paint technology for further series applications will continue. With the paintwork for the M4 small series, the BMW Group is testing  the possibilities of the new process. These unique vehicles will  initially be used in the company's own fleet. Series introduction of  the piloted paint process is scheduled to begin in 2022 in the BMW  Group production network.  \n"}

Superblue and BMW i present    “No One is an Island”, a collaboration between the  art group Random International and choreographer Wayne McGregor and  his company. On the occasion of Frieze London, the performance will be  shown publicly from October 13 to 16 daily between 3:00 and 7:00pm at  Park Village Studios.Random International, Studio Wayne McGregor, Superblue and BMW i  share a passion for pushing boundaries and exploring new territories.  All are moved by similar questions about how future generations will  interact with automated and digitised processes and environments  whilst embracing reduction and sustainability. For this purpose, they  are collaborating on a special project: “No One is an Island”.  Conceptualised as a “Gesamtkunstwerk”, “No One is an Island” is  developed in an ongoing dialogue and exchange between artists and partners.“No One is an Island” is fuelled by science and explores electrified  movement steered by advanced algorithms. It is a future-oriented  reflection on how the human mind empathises with artificial  intelligence and automated processes. The performance comprises  sculptural, performative, and musical aspects.The centrepiece is a sculpture by Random  International that experiments with the minimal amount of  information that is actually necessary for an animated form to be  recognised as human; and the fundamental impact created by subtle  changes within that information. As it transitions from robot to human  likeness, dancers from Company Wayne McGregor  interact with the sculpture in a live, kinetic performance, further  exploring the relationship between humans and technology and our  capacity to empathise with a machine. The dancer’s interventions  scored by Chihei Hatakeyama add a performative  dimension to the sculpture, re-translating and celebrating the  connection between human and mechanical movement.A second artwork by Random International, part of the “Body\/Light”  series, was inspired by Picasso’s light drawings and premiered by Arts  Brookfield, BMW and Superblue during Frieze New York. “Body\/Light”  allows visitors in London to create their own lines of light,  capturing movement and electricity visually. In this way, elements  from the core of BMW i, which stands for sustainable, future-oriented  and forward-looking mobility, are recreated.“Catalysed by the partnership with BMW i and the collaboration with  Studio Wayne McGregor, we have elevated our ongoing ‘Fifteen Points’  series of sculptures to a whole new level. Through the addition of  both a score by Chihei Hatakeyama and dedicated choreography by Wayne  McGregor, we are able to explore in much more detail the as-of-yet  unknown territories of 'empathy with machines’. The work is part of a  wider reflection on our human need to relate to our surroundings; how  does such a need to connect play out in light of an increasing  automation and digitisation of our environment? Will our willingness  to engage with unknown systems leave us more vulnerable? We are much  looking forward to presenting the work in a series of live  performances in 2021,” says Hannes Koch, one of the  founders and directors of Random International about the collaboration.“What I find inspiring about the partnership with Random  International, Superblue, BMW i and myself is that we all come  together from different knowledge sets, but convene in areas of  shared interest,” says Wayne McGregor. “We are all  fascinated by the potential of the human body, its relationship with  and to technology but most importantly our desire to generate  empathetic connections between people. This is a dialogue of  inter-connectedness, exploration, and surprise. We have no  pre-determined road map – instead, we feed from one another’s  expertise and ideas to push ourselves towards new horizons.” Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst, Co-Founder and CEO of  Superblue says, “Creating new platforms and opportunities for  experiential artists to collaborate is core to Superblue’s mission, so  we are delighted to partner on this project and creative dialogue  between Random International, Studio Wayne McGregor, and BMW i. ‘No  One is an Island’ provokes questions about the dynamics between  technology and humanity that are critical to deepening our  understanding of our relationship to the world and each other.”“We believe that working together with great artists like Random  International, represented by Superblue, and Studio Wayne McGregor is  an inspiring and enriching experience for all parties involved.  Speaking of BMW i, the constant exchange with creatives is essential.  And just as BMW i embodies innovation, ‘No One is an Island’  synergises future and present, technology and humanity,” says    Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand Experience.Public Days:October 13 to 16, 2021Daily performance at 3.00pm, 3.30pm,  4.00pm, 4.30pm, 5.30pm, 6.00pm and 6.30pm.Park Village Studios1 Park Village E,London NW1 7PXTo visit the performance, it’s necessary to register here.(https:\/\/emt.bmw-arts-design.com\/exhibition-random-international?partner=mSSgv4ANIz) For further questions please contact:BMW Group Cultural EngagementProf. Dr Thomas  Girst BMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs Head of  Cultural Engagement Telephone: +49-89-382-24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.com www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.de Random International Jen BarnesProducer  and Commissions ManagerRandom International136 Hermitage  RoadLondon N4 1NLTelephone: + 44 20 8673 5497Email:    jen@random-international.comwww.random-international.comStudio Wayne McGregorGillian  McVeyDirector of CommunicationsEmail: g@gillianmcvey.com and v@gillianmcvey.com www.waynemcgregor.com Superblue Sarah McNaughtonResnicow and  AssociatesTelephone: +1 212 671 5161Email: superblue@resnicow.com\n"}
{"prompt":"If you want to explore the world, you need a thirst for knowledge, a  thirst for adventure and a four-wheel drive MINI Countryman. With it, you can travel safely even where more than half of the country's  inhabitants firmly believe in the existence of supernatural beings - in  Iceland. Especially a trip to the Westfjords, which are little developed  for tourists, brings visitors closer to the life and culture of the  islanders and breathtaking nature.  ->","completion":" Reykjavik. Anyone who wanted to know where elves,  fairies, gnomes or trolls lived could once ask Erla Stefansdottir. She  was Iceland's elf commissioner and often advised the building  authority so that new roads would not cross magical places. In this  respect, when travelling by car from the capital Reykjavik along the  few paved and unpaved roads to the most westerly places in Europe, one  need not fear waking sleeping supernatural beings. Especially not in  the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 (fuel consumption combined: 6.5 -  6.2\/100 km according to EU, CO2 149 - 142 g\/km).If you want to experience Iceland, you can't avoid using part of the  Ring Road 1 from the capital Reykjavik. Even here, the MINI Cooper S  Countryman ALL4 with its smooth-running two-litre four-cylinder engine  shows just how good it is to travel with 131 kW\/178 hp. The MINI  Cooper S Countryman ALL4 - supported by the eight_x0002_speed Steptronic  gearbox - accelerates from 0 to 100 km\/h in 7.3 seconds. However, it  cannot live up to its possible top speed of 222 km\/h because more than  90 km\/h is not permitted anywhere. On gravel roads - and there are  many of them, as in Iceland only about 4300 kilometres of road are  asphalted - the maximum speed is 80 km\/h, and even that can be too fast.Heading west, the \"1\" first takes island explorers to  Bogarnes, the economic centre of West Iceland with a fabulous  panoramic view. The town's hot water comes from Iceland's largest hot  water spring, Deildartunguhver, with 180 litres per second. From here,  it is worth taking a detour along highway 54 to the  167-square-kilometre Snaefellsjökull National Park, dominated by a  1446-metre-high volcanic cone. Thousands of seabirds populate the  Londrangar rock towers. Also worth seeing is Dritvik Bay with the  ruins of the only fishing station and the black lava gravel beach of Djupalonssandur.Even though many paths along the coasts can only be explored by feet,  the ALL4 all-wheel drive system provides Icelanders with the best  traction wherever cars are allowed to drive. After all, loose ground  and water crossings are commonplace on almost every tour in  Iceland.The system is based on an electromechanically operating centre  differential that distributes the drive power continuously between the  front and rear axles - depending on requirements. Up to 100 percent  can be directed to the rear; the normal driving condition ensures a  50:50 distribution. The 16.5 centimetres of ground clearance of the  MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 has a calming effect on Iceland, because  even asphalt roads surprise with deep potholes due to frost, among  other things, which the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 can easily cope  - thanks to plenty of space under the floor and a sophisticated chassisContinue to the small fishing town of Stykkisholmur, once a trading  centre of the German Hanseatic League, now proud of its striking  modern church and many old homes. Turn left from the 54 onto the 60  heading north, leading travellers to the particularly wild and  pristine Westfjords landscape, where the land masses between the  fjords look like fingers stretching towards Greenland. The 60 and 62  lead to the westernmost point of Europe, Bjargtangar lighthouse, on  the 14-kilometre-long Lätrabjarg cliff. Among other things, thousands  of puffins live on rocks with a maximum height of 440 metres - a real  change from the sight of the many sheep and Icelandic horses that  otherwise populate the island.Maybe this is the right place to spend the night - why not in a roof  tent carried along by the Italian manufacturer Autohome? The black box  weighs 58 kilos and measures 210 by 130 centimetres. With the carrier,  the MINI is just 2.05 metres high. Setting up the tent is easy: unlock  the box at the front and back, gas pressure springs open the flap. The  tent is boarded via an aluminium folding ladder. Mesh pockets hold the  little things people need every night, and an LED light provides a  clear view. The next morning, the box is closed again with straps, and  that's it.Freshly fortified, we continue to our next destination, Bildudalur -  and because we are in the land of elves and trolls, you must visit the  creepy Skrimslasetrid Museum for Sea Monsters and Monsters in  Strandgata 7 to enjoy interactive and multimedia entertainment. Things  get louder further north at Dynjandi, where you'll find the  \"Thundering\", \"Roaring\" or \"Raging\":  Iceland's probably most beautiful waterfall is around 100 metres high  and shines with six steps. The protected natural monument is 30 metres  wide at the top and 60 metres wide at the bottom and extremely impressive.Almost like the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4, which at an overall  length of 4.3 metres and a wheelbase of 2.67 metres, it offers plenty  of space for five people. A few more live in Isafjördur further north  - with 2700 inhabitants, the town marks the Westfjord metropolis with  captain's houses, fishermen's monument and an archway made of  whalebone. This is the right place for souvenir shopping, which can be  safely stored in the boot with a minimum capacity of 450 litres. If  only two people are travelling, the souvenirs can be much larger - in  this case the MINI Cooper S Countryman ALL4 can hold up to 1390  litres. Enough space to take a little salt with you: In Reykjanes,  it's worth visiting the \"Salzverk\" - salt is extracted from  the earth in a climate_x0002_friendly way with the help of 100-degree  hot water. Fuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption were    measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC)    2007\/715 as amended.

For organizational  reasons and due to attendance limits dictated by the anti-covid rules  the public event in the parkland of Villa Erba and the Concorso di  Motociclette are not being held in 2021.The organisers ask for understanding in relation to the unusual form  of the event this year and will enable the loyal public to follow the  legendary parade of cars from 2.00 to 4.00 p.m. on Saturday 2nd  October 2021 in a livestream on the website https:\/\/www.concorsodeleganzavilladeste.com\/Jeff Koons will give initial insights into his project with BMW at a  Closed Room presentation of THE 8X JEFF KOONS, his limited edition of  the M850i xDrive Gran Coupé. The result of this collaboration embodies  precision, refinement and craft artistry, and it is a perfect match  with the atmosphere of the Renaissance residence on the shores of Lake  Como. Jeff Koons will join together with the Head of BMW Group Design,  Adrian van Hooydonk, to talk about the connection between art and  mobility, inspiration and creativity, and interaction between these  different areas.This year, the Head of BMW Group Classic, Helmut Käs, is taking over  the Presidency of the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este from Ulrich  Knieps, who defined the prestigious event from 2014 to 2020, and who  will also be present at this year’s edition.About 50 exclusively selected Historic Cars will be shown in eight  classes at this edition of the Concorso d´Eleganza. The evocative  titles of the classes highlight the most exciting and most attractive  interpretations in the history of the automobile:Class A – Twentieth Century Style: From Touring  Torpedo to Racy RoadsterClass B – Developing the Theme: Space, Pace and GraceClass C – Showroom Showdown: Britain and Germany  Battle for Luxury SupremacyClass D – Granturismo all´Italiana: Finding the  Perfect GT FormulaClass E – Big Band ´40s to Awesome ´80s: Five Decades  of Endurance RacingClass F – A Passion for Perfection: Celebrating 90  Years of PininfarinaClass G – The Birth of the Supercar: Latin Style LandmarksClass H – The Next Generation: Hypercars of the 1990sIn addition, the participating Concept Cars & Prototypes will  provide a global highlight. Five visionary one-of-a-kind specials will  be presented alongside each other for the first time in a unique showing.The BMW Group will also present a pioneering concept for sustainable  mobility at this year’s Concorso d´Eleganza Villa d´Este: the BMW i  Vision Circular. The vision car has been consistently designed on the  basis of the principles of the circular economy. The aim is to achieve  100 percent use of recycled materials and 100 percent recyclability.  The BMW Group intends to become the most successful and most  sustainable premium manufacturer for individual mobility. That’s why  the company is adopting a responsible approach and placing these  issues at the centre of its strategy. The BMW i Vision Circular also  demonstrates that a premium aspiration need not be a contradiction  with sustainability.The worldwide debut of the Rolls-Royce Boat Tail in the Mosaic Garden  of Villa d’Este will undoubtedly create a sensation. This is an  initial apogee of a coachbuilding project over four years with three  unusual Rolls-Royce clients. A personalised automobile of superlative  excellence has been designed for each one. The convertible has a  length of 5.80 m and comes from the British luxury marque with a long  “Boat Tail” designed like a yacht to provide a perfect accompaniment  for the journey along the fabulous winding road on the banks of Lake Como.This year, the programme of the Concorso d´Eleganza will once again  be defined by the exhibition of participating cars, the exquisite  aesthetics of their styling and contours, and the crowning of the most  elegant and technically excellent winners of the beauty contest by the  Jury. The winners of the Coppa d´Oro Villa d´Este will receive their  award on Saturday and the winners of the various vehicle classes, the  Concorso d’Eleganza Design Award and the Best of Show Award for the  overall winner of all classes will be presented on Sunday.Once again this year, we would like to extend our thanks to our loyal  partners A.

{"prompt":" Outdoor tugger trains, car box and car trailer piloted in outdoor areas at Plant Dingolfing  ->","completion":" Dingolfing. At BMW Group Plant Dingolfing, automated  transport systems have long been an essential part of plant  operations: From autonomous tugger trains to smart transport robots to  car forklifts – rollout of these innovative vehicles is well underway,  and they have already become a common sight in production halls. “Due  to the wide variety of models we have here in Dingolfing, from the BMW  4 Series to the fully-electric BMW iX, our assembly logistics  currently handles different articles and part” explains Armin Feser,  head of Physical Logistics at BMW Group Plant Dingolfing. “Automated  transport systems help us manage this complexity and organise our  logistics processes at the plant more efficiently.”After using these innovative vehicles indoors, the next step is to  deploy automated transport systems in areas outside the production  halls. Pilot projects have been running on the plant grounds for  several weeks – with two automated outdoor tugger trains, a so-called  car box and a car trailer.Peter Kiermaier is responsible for logistics planning and  industrialisation of logistics innovations at Plant Dingolfing. He  firmly believes these vehicles have potential for the future, but also  describes the unique challenges of using them outdoors: “On the one  hand, because of the weather, we have far more disruptive and  influencing factors, so we need more robust sensors and systems. On  the other, we also need vehicles and systems that can communicate and  interact effectively with each another.”He says protecting other road users, such as pedestrians and  cyclists, is top priority and requires the innovative vehicle to be  integrated into the existing traffic control system.As part of the AC Log (Autonomous & Connected Logistics) research  project, plans call for the car trailer and car box to be connected to  5G, so they can communicate with the existing BMW standard control system.Specifically, two different outdoor tugger train models are currently  being piloted: The first is a tugger train built by Linde, with an  integrated automation kit from Schiller and a traction of three  tonnes, which is being used to transport door handles autonomously,  without a driver, in covered open spaces. The second model, from  French manufacturer Easymile, builds on lessons learned from vehicle  technology for autonomous driving and is mainly being used to  transport PHS sheet metal parts outdoors. The electric hauler delivers  up to 15 tonnes of traction and, with three trailers, reaches a length  of over 16 metres and an automated speed of 10 km\/h. It comes with a  complex navigation system that uses GPS satellite navigation and Lidar  technology to create a 3D image of the surroundings.An automated, self-driving car box from Stäubli-WFT is also being  piloted. With a footprint of 4.5 x 2 metres and a housing to protect  transported goods from the weather, it is ideally equipped for outdoor  use. The self-driving box moves special containers back and forth  between locations where empty containers are stored and returned in  the northern sector of Plant 02.40. “The product represents a further  development of the previous indoor vehicle used at the Dingolfing  Dynamics Centre 02.70. In the long run, we want to achieve greater  flexibility by using different vehicle sizes and transport  volumes,\" explains Dr Thomas Irrenhauser, head of Technology  Development Innovation.Another device from Stäubli-WFT, the car trailer, is currently in use  at the Dynamics Centre (DYZ). In the near future, two automated car  trailers will be deployed at this location to move containers arriving  by rail to the docking gates for outgoing goods at the container yard,  some 500 metres away, instead of tractor units. There, the container  will be loaded with new parts, which are then transported back to the  container yard by the car trailer, where they wait to be shipped.\n"}

As Worldwide Partner, BMW has underlined its  status as an outstanding partner for the game of golf. With the  ‘Ultimate Journey,’ we have created an unforgettable moment.”The Americans, who were able to call upon the services of eighth of  the world’s top ten, lived up to their billing as favourites from the  first tee shot and led by 11:5 after the doubles matches. Captain  Steve Stricker’s team was also by far the stronger in the singles and  pushed on to win by the biggest margin since 1979, the first time a  European team appeared in the Ryder Cup. The biggest victory prior to  this year’s event was a 18.5:9.5 achieved by Europe in 2006 and 2004  and the USA in 1981.One of the few bright spots for the defending champions was Sergio  García, who set a new record on Saturday morning with his  24th match win, passing the previous record holder Sir Nick  Faldo (ENG). Over the course of his career, which spans ten Ryder Cup  appearances, the Spaniard has now won 25 matches and scored 28.5  points – also a record.The BMW Group can look back on a partnership with the Ryder Cup that  dates back to 2006.

The tenth race weekend of the 2021 FIM    Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Jerez de la Frontera    (ESP) was overshadowed by a fatal accident involving Spain’s Dean    Berta Viñales. The young rider crashed in Saturday’s Supersport 300 race.    The thoughts of BMW Motorrad Motorsport are with Viñales’ family, friends and team. We would like to offer them our    sincere condolences. After the tragic accident, all the remaining races scheduled for  Saturday were cancelled. In consultation with Viñales’ family, it was  decided to continue the race weekend on Sunday and to stage the races  in memory of the young rider. On Sunday morning, the paddock paid its  respects with a minute’s silence. Sunday’s itinerary was amended to  feature two 20-lap WorldSBK races. Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team ended  race one in seventh place. He then finished eighth in race two.  Deputizing for Van der Mark’s team-mate, Tom Sykes (GBR), in Jerez de  la Frontera was Eugene Laverty (IRL). In light of the injury that  Sykes suffered last Sunday in Barcelona, the decision was taken for  him to sit out the Jerez weekend. Laverty was 12th and 11th in the two  races. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team finished  14th in race one and crossed the finish line 13th in race two. Quotes after the races at Jerez de la Frontera. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  sad news of Dean Berta Viñales’ death was a shock to all of us. On  behalf of BMW Motorrad Motorsport, I would like to express our sincere  sympathy to his relatives. It was not easy to get back to the sporting  action after this tragic accident. “Regarding our weekend: I think we do have solid results with seventh  and eighth, which I am pleased with. However, the weekend was  compromised by a not so good qualifying with all the BMWs starting  from the fifth row. So Michael starting from 13th and ending up in  seventh and eighth was definitely a solid performance. The gap to the  podium was not so big. So we have to work on our qualifying  performance and then we can make the next step. Jonas definitely had  two of his better races. He was right up there with Eugene. For  Eugene, of course, it was difficult to jump on the bike again after  missing some rounds. We tried hard to get him a good feeling on the  bike, but did not entirely get there. Both of them, Eugene and Jonas,  were about 27 to 30 seconds off the win, which is for Jonas definitely  one of the best results he has had this year. It is pleasing to see  that he is going forward.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “First of all commiserations to the Viñales family. It was  devastating news yesterday. I think the paddock has really pulled  together and raced today in memory of Dean. It is sad to be racing  under these circumstances. “Mickey really struggled in qualifying yesterday. It is clear that we  couldn’t master the two Qs he had, so starting from that grid position  was always going to be a challenge. We did not expect to get to the  top eight, but he was seventh and eighth, battling his way through. It  is quite clear that when you are coming from so far back you are using  the best of your tyre to get into that position, and at the end you  have nothing to fight with. He just defended his position. Mickey has  had a very strong Sunday. Eugene came back after a longer lay-off,  stood in for Tom, and I have to say that he has done a great job. He  did two great races. He quickly made up the places that he was able  to. He got his head down and really ground through the laps, as we  know how he can do in race conditions, and he came away with two  strong positions. Now we bring the curtain down on what has been a  really difficult weekend for everybody in the WorldSBK paddock and  move on to Portugal.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was a difficult weekend for the WorldSBK paddock. I want to express my  condolences to Dean’s family and friends. Today we raced for him. Our  results haven’t been bad when you see where we came from. Yesterday, I  had no confidence to go faster so I was a bit disappointing. After a  lot of studying the data the guys changed a lot on the bike and  already this morning in warm-up I felt a big improvement. Also in both  of today’s races I felt a massive step forward. And if you look at our  lap times, the consistency and also the gap to the winner and the  podium guys, I think we made a solid step. That gives me a lot of  confidence and that is what we need. We have tried some things that  will for sure be helping in the future.” Eugene Laverty, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “First of  all, my thoughts are with Dean’s family and friends and I’d like to  express my condolences to them. It was a shock for all of us when we  heard of the tragic loss of such a young life yesterday. Sporting  wise, my objective was to be closer to the front, so I’m disappointed  with the race results. We were working all weekend to get the bike to  feel more like the bike that I had in the second half of last year and  the first half of this year, but it just felt like a different bike  under acceleration. Something was amiss in terms of power delivery on  corner exit and we didn’t have enough time on track to really get to  the bottom of it. I did what I could and a big thank you to BMW  Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team for allowing me  to come back for this weekend.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was not easy to  focus on the job at hand again today. A crash with fatal consequences  is not easy to block out. My deepest sympathy goes to the relatives of  Dean Berta Viñales. From my own perspective, I am really happy with my  races today. The early laps did not go as I hoped, as I was struggling  with the new tyres, which lost their grip very quickly and were very  erratic. However, after five or six laps I was able to establish my  rhythm and could feel the bike better. After race one we knew what we  had to do. I battled against good people and could see where the  differences were. I then carried a lot of confidence into race two. I  again had difficulties with the new tyres in the first few laps, but  then rode a great race. I was able to overtake and, towards the end,  bridged the gap to Leon Haslam and Eugene Laverty. That showed how  much better things were this weekend than they have been. We took a  step forward, which is nice to see.” \n"}

After four hours of    racing, Neil Verhagen (USA), Dan Harper (GBR) and Max Hesse (GER)    crossed the finish line in third place in the # 44 BMW M6 GT3. In    the end, the trio was only 14 hundredths of a second short of second    place. The new BMW M4 GT3 took the chequered flag in fifth place.    The #55 car was driven by Philipp Eng (AUT) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). In qualifying on Saturday morning, that had to be shortened to 45  minutes due to fog, the BMW Juniors secured third on the grid. The  start of the race was postponed by half an hour to 12:30. In the  turmoil of the first corners the #44 BMW M6 GT3 initially fell back to  sixth place, but Verhagen, Harper and Hesse quickly worked their way  back towards the front. In the exciting final stages, Hesse put the  second placed Audi in front of him under massive pressure, but he  couldn’t find the opportunity to overtake, and this was also due to  Code 60 zones. After four hours, the #44 BMW M6 GT3 crossed the line  in third. After the wins in races four and five and second place in  round seven, this was the next podium success for the BMW Junior Team. The #55 BMW M4 GT3 once again took part out of competition in the  prototype class SP-X. Because of this, Eng and Farfus started the race  behind the field of SP9 cars. In its second race the new car again ran  without any problems and improved position by position. After four  hours of racing, Farfus took the flag in fifth place. The gap to the  front was only 86 seconds.  Walkenhorst Motorsport finished third in the SP9 Am class with the  #36 BMW. The car was driven by Henry Walkenhorst, Friedrich von Bohlen  and Jörg Breuer (all GER). The team’s #34 BMW M6 GT3, with David  Pittard (GBR), Ben Tuck (GBR) and Christian Krognes (NOR) at the  wheel, was in second place after a fantastic start. Pittard also set a  new NLS lap record in 7:53.202 minutes. But then, the #34 fell far  back due to a damaged tyre. In the different classes, the BMW M Motorsport teams claimed a total  of four class wins. The season finale of the 2021 Nürburgring  Endurance Series will be held in two weeks’ time, on 9th October. Reactions after round eight of the 2021 NLS. Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “It has been a  great and for us an entirely positive day of racing in the Eifel  mountains. It started with the fact that spectators were again allowed  onto the starting grid. That made the atmosphere very special. The  race itself once again went smoothly. Our BMW Juniors Neil, Dan and  Max put in another great performance, and Max’s fight for second place  in the final laps was really breathtaking. It didn’t quite work out,  but third place is another great result. Also Philipp’s and Augusto’s  race in the new BMW M4 GT3 was fantastic. Both once again confirmed  that the handling and performance of the new car are excellent. The  BMW M4 GT3 is fast and easy to drive. Overall, the race went  trouble-free for us from A to Z. I would like to thank the entire  development team, BMW Team RMG, the drivers and everyone involved in  the project for their great work.” Max Hesse, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “We gave  our everything and a couple of times it could have nearly worked out.  But in the end, the Audi had a bit more top speed than us, and exiting  the Code 60 zone at the Döttinger Höhe there was no chance. And we all  know: to overtake on the Nordschleife is not the easiest task. But it  is great to be on the podium again. We also collected good points for  the championship – the fight is on!” Neil Verhagen, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “We  are happy with another podium. We have now been on the podium  regularly after the 24-hour race. This is good; it shows our  consistency and how we have been improving since the beginning of the  year. A big thank you to BMW M Motorsport, BMW Team RMG and Shell for  continuing to improve. At the end of the race it was difficult to  overtake the Audi. We were able to catch up quite quickly, but  unfortunately it was very difficult to find a way around. Overall,  again it has definitely been a very solid weekend. It will be an  eventful last race. Looking at the championship, it is going to be  quite close. I am looking forward to it!“ Dan Harper, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “The  final laps have been very intense to watch from the pit box. It was a  really great fight, even if it did not quite work out for us.  Unfortunately a small contact when I was in the car cost us some time  today, but we learn from it and are still happy to be on the podium.” Philipp Eng, #55 BMW M4 GT3: “Again, every single lap  in the BMW M4 GT3 was just a dream. It is so much fun to drive this  car. We have been very consistent, the car handles the tyres well and  is very good to drive, especially in traffic. Once again, it was great  team work and I think we have a very strong package in the BMW M4 GT3.  I am already looking forward to the next tasks with the car, and  especially to next year when it will start in its first real racing  season. Everyone at BMW M Motorsport has done an outstanding job. The  development work was intensive, the right decisions have been made,  and now we have a product that just works superbly and which you climb  in and feel comfortable straight away.” Augusto Farfus, #55 BMW M4 GT3: “It was a great race.  We managed to race the car close to the leaders. I think today we have  seen that the car is very competitive and I think we can all be proud  of what we have achieved. P5 today was a great achievement and somehow  it feels like a little victory for us. It makes us confident that next  year we can fight for proper victories. Now we focus on the next steps  and thanks again to BMW M Motorsport for this opportunity to drive the  car. It is real fun, and it is great to be behind the wheel.” \n"}

The ‘Ultimate Journey’ to the opening    ceremony, for which Worldwide Partner BMW, BMW Group Designworks and    the team around wingsuit pilot Peter Salzmann (AUT) chose the skies    above Wisconsin as the stage, was equally spectacular.Equipped with a wingsuit in a Ryder Cup design, as well as a  transport capsule for the trophy, specially developed by BMW Group  Designworks for that purpose, Salzmann and his team leapt out of a  helicopter from 3,000 metres above sea level. The Ryder Cup Trophy  Case was fastened to the Austrian’s body using a construction that  guaranteed him the necessary freedom of movement and also had the  required aerodynamic properties. This made it possible to land safely  with the trophy after two minutes of flying, despite a top speed of  230 km\/h, before it was driven in its case to the opening ceremony at  Whistling Straits in the BMW Group’s fully-electric technology  flagship, the BMW iX xDrive50*. The Ultimate Journey ended with  Salzmann carrying the trophy onto the stage at the opening ceremony.“The Ryder Cup is of significant importance in the golfing and  sporting world. This contest casts its spell over the competitors and  teams, just as it does the enthusiastic spectators at the course and  the many fans watching from the edge of their seats all over the  world,” said Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand Communication and  Brand Experience BMW Group. “To acknowledge the prominent position of  this competition, and to celebrate the premiere of BMW as Worldwide  Partner of the Ryder Cup, we wanted to make the arrival of the trophy  particularly special. To do so, we created a unique case for the  trophy, which is both innovative and representative.”The chief criterion when developing the trophy case was to protect  the Ryder Cup during the stunt. At the same time, it had to guarantee  the freedom to move for the wingsuit pilot, as well as optimal  aerodynamic properties. Furthermore, it should be an emotive design,  which continues to represent the status of the trophy and the event  even after the stunt – the challenge was to create a product that is  innovative, luxurious and inspiring, and thus reflects the spirit of  BMW i. A challenge tailor-made for Designworks, the innovative engine  of the BMW Group, with its expertise in bringing together the needs of  mobility and other sectors.“When asked to work on this project connected to the historical Ryder  Cup event it was something that excited me to be part of. We just knew  it had to be a product that blends the BMW i excitement for technology  with the prestigious and honourable aspects surrounding the event  itself,” said Tommy Forsgren, Designworks Lead Designer. “The case  design is a true innovative BMW i product – its premium qualities and  exclusivity matching the new BMW iX in terms of colour and material finish.”The trophy case consists of an outer aluminium frame and a 3D printed  space frame capsule with large gaps, allowing the Ryder Cup trophy to  be seen, even when closed and during the flight. The case can be  attached to the interior skeleton of the wingsuit just as quickly as  it can to a wall – for example, for exhibition purposes. The opening  mechanism is like that found on a wing door.The Ryder Cup is not the first project, on which BMW i, BMW Group  Designworks and Peter Salzmann have collaborated. Together, they  developed the ‘Electrified Wingsuit by BMW i’: an innovative, electric  drive module and a wingsuit designed from scratch allowed Salzmann to  fulfil his dream of developing his sport and breaking new ground with  sophisticated drive technology.\n"}
{"prompt":"The “Main metropolis” has much more to offer than just banks and the  stock exchange - so quickly board the all-electric MINI and walk in the  footsteps of Goethe, Brentano and Chaplin ->","completion":" Frankfurt. Just like New York's famous district,  Hesse's largest city, Frankfurt am Main, has much more to offer than  money trading and investment advice. Culture, for example. And that  can be wonderfully experienced in the MINI Cooper SE (fuel consumption  combined: 0.0 l\/100 km; electricity consumption combined: 17.6 - 15.2  kWh\/100 km according to WLTP, 16.1 - 14.9 kWh\/100 km according to  NEDC, CO2 emissions combined 0 g\/km).So get into the fully electric four-seater and enjoy: both the car  and Frankfurt - according to a study by the Economist, Germany's most  liveable city. For start-ups, Frankfurt is said to be the best place  after Munich and Berlin. And when it comes to culture? It looks just  as rosy - especially when measured against its size.A good 700,000 inhabitants and their guests have around 20 stages for  about 50 free groups at their disposal on a city area of 248.31 square  kilometres. About 500 monuments, art objects and memorials await the  curious. The museum landscape is more diverse than in almost any other  German city. The so-called Museumsufer between Eisernem Steg and  Friedensbrücke has something for every taste, from film to  architecture museums. The classics include the Schirn, Städel and the  Museum of Modern Art - the Caricatura Museum of Comic Art, on the  other hand, is a laugh riot. There are a large number of places of  interest to visit around the clock - starting with medieval wayside  crosses to historicist bronze monuments, 14-metre tall light  installations, graffiti art or the \"Comic Art\" of the  \"New Frankfurt School\" placed in forests and meadows with 15  objects in Frankfurt's \"GrünGürtel\".You should start with a full battery. By 2030, there should be 350  fast charging points and 875 normal charging points in the city.  Perfect for the MINI Cooper SE, whose high-voltage battery has a gross  capacity of 32.6 kWh. The charging power is up to 50 kW. At  fast_x0002_charging stations, it takes just 35 minutes to charge the  completely empty battery up to 80 percent.If you enter the city in the MINI Cooper SE from the Northwest Cross  to visit a few cultural highlights, it doesn't take long to find  yourself in the middle of the artistic world. Example: Kleinen  Nelkenstraße 19 in the Hausen district is home to Atelier 19, which is  run by four artists with creative play forms of educational offers,  photographs on the subject of industrial culture, artistic works on  the ambivalence of human sensitivities and conditions within the field  of tension of nature versus culture, as well as paintings with a focus  on white, black and the shades of grey in between.A lot of heavy fare. So the next stop in neighbouring Rödelheim is  just right, because it takes you into a fairytale kingdom. The  Brentanopark, the country estate of the Brentanos in the 1820s, is  located directly on the Nidda. The Petrihaus on Rödelheimer Parkweg,  restored in 1998, is the last surviving Swiss house in Frankfurt, so  popular in the Romanesque period. And while you're here: via the A 648  you can get to the famous \"Hammering Man\" at the entrance to  the exhibition centre - a 21.5-metre-high, 32-tonne moving sculpture  by Jonathan Borofsky.The old town next to it is not another destination this time - but  Goethe cannot be left out. After passing the Gallusanlage, a stop at  Grosse Hirschgraben 23 is a must: this is where the great poet was  born, where he lived until 1795, and where those, who are interested  can immerse themselves in his world. And they can admire, among other  things, the astronomical clock that Goethe's friend Wilhelm Friedrich  Hüsgen had built in 1746. And don't worry: thanks to the MINI Cooper  SE's compact length of 3.845 metres, you can always find a parking space.After a short refreshment with typical Frankfurt fare such as  \"Ebbelwoi\" (apple wine, at least for the passengers),  Handkäs mit Musik (sour milk cheese in a spicy marinade) and eggs in  the famous \"Grie Soß\" (green herb sauce), the route could  lead north.The next stop is at the Albert Schweitzer Centre at Wolfsgangstraße  109, where numerous originals from Schweitzer's estate and his time as  a doctor in Equatorial Africa are waiting for children and young  people in a permanent exhibition - because it is especially them who  are to be made aware of the goals and philosophy of the Nobel Peace  Prize winner thanks to films, hands-on activities and various  stations. He once said that Frankfurt had cast a special spell on him.After this visit, the journey continues north to the Chaplin Archive  at Klarastraße 5. The private museum, which is open to the public,  deals with the American cinema legend on two floors; the collection  includes around 6000 individual pieces on the total work of art  Charlie Chaplin. The film archive with about 450 copies of the 80  Chaplin films is also located there.What would Chaplin have said about the MINI Cooper SE? He probably  would have just smiled mischievously at the acceleration from 0 to 60  in 3.9 seconds and from 0 to 100 km\/h in 7.3 seconds thanks to the  powerful 135 kW\/184 hp electric motor. And then asked to stay in the  car even longer. That can be done - after so much culture and city,  with a detour to the Taunus, preferably to the Feldberg. To do this,  we steer north-east, cross the A5 and enjoy the comfort of the premium  small car in the first Taunus overhangs, which makes cornering a  pleasure thanks to the sophisticated chassis and low centre of  gravity. We drive up to the Feldberg at an altitude of 881 metres with  the distinctive 50-metre-high transmission mast built in 1973 at the top.On the way back downhill, the MINI Cooper SE's two-stage recuperation  can be used to great effect. The engine acts as a generator, feeding  the energy generated in overrun mode into the high-voltage storage  system. The driver can activate the particularly intensive  recuperation and the \"one-pedal\" feeling via the toggle switch.This allows the MINI Cooper SE to decelerate perfectly even without  using the brakes. And even if the brake pedal is not used, the brake  lights still indicate the sharp reduction in speed.Finally, it's back to Frankfurt - for after-work. The scene in  Frankfurt am Main is more established than in any other city. Never  boring, always unique. Almost like a MINI Cooper SE. Fuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption were    measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC)    2007\/715 as amended.

Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you a regular overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. ->","completion":" DTM: Victory and third place for Marco Wittmann at Assen. Marco Wittmann (GER) celebrated his second win of the season on the  sixth DTM race weekend. The two-time DTM champion delivered a  sensational performance in a chaotic Saturday race at Assen, the  ‘Cathedral of Speed’. Starting from second on the grid, he secured the  win at the wheel of his #11 BMW M6 GT3 from the Walkenhorst Motorsport  team, even overcoming a five-second penalty during the closing stage  of the race. “My team and I decided to make our mandatory pit stop a  little later,” said Wittmann. “That was a key moment, as the fresher  tyres meant that we could attack the other cars in front of me. I gave  it everything in that manoeuvre against Liam Lawson and risked the  lot, a decision for which I was later penalised. It is a great feeling  to be able to win despite this, and it is a fantastic team  performance.” In the #31 BMW M6 GT3 from ROWE Racing, Sheldon van der  Linde (RSA) also scored points in sixth place, while team-mate Timo  Glock (GER) was forced to retire in the #16 BMW M6 GT3. Wittmann gave another impressive performance on Sunday. Having  started the race from second on the grid once again, he was able to  reach third place and claim his fifth podium of the season despite  carrying 25 kilos of additional weight. Glock finished the race in  14th place, while van der Linde had to head for the pits and retire early.Wittmann has now made up some ground on his rivals in the  drivers’ standings, moving up to second place overall after six of  eight race weekends, ten points behind the leader.

Oeverhaus was the  best-placed BMW driver in fourth, while Zimmer crossed the finish line  in eighth once again. Ninth and tenth positions went to Michael Schrey  (GER \/ Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport) and Löhner. --BMW M2 Cup: Caresani and Oeverhaus win in Assen.  Colin Caresani (NED) and Theo Oeverhaus (GER) came out  on top in both races on the penultimate weekend of the BMW M2 Cup at  Assen (NED). In Saturday’s race, local hero Caresani claimed victory  in the #47 BMW M2 CS Racing, just ahead of Michael Schrey (GER) in the  #2 BMW M2 CS Racing and Davit Kajaia (GEO) in the #5 BMW M2 CS Racing.  This represented a first win in the one-make cup for Caresani, who  nearly repeated the feat in Sunday's race. He defended first place  until the closing stage of the race, before yielding to race winner  Oeverhaus in the #34 BMW M2 CS Racing. “I am over the moon,” said  Oeverhaus, who had started the race from eighth on the grid. “At the  start, I would never have thought it would go so well today. It is  really difficult to overtake on this circuit but then it went better  than I had thought. My car really was perfect – thanks to the team for  that.” Louis Henkefend (GER) crossed the line in third place to extend  his lead in the overall standings.

For BMW Motorrad Motorsport, Sunday’s action in the    FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in Barcelona (ESP) was    overshadowed by a heavy crash involving Tom Sykes (GBR) in race two.    The British rider was taken to hospital for further checks as a    precaution after initial examinations at the Medical Centre revealed    that he had suffered a concussion. His team-mate from the BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team, Michael van der Mark (NED), completed the    second race in ninth position. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo    MGM Racing team crossed the line in 16th place. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had already endured some poor luck in  the morning’s Superpole race. Van der Mark fell on the first lap,  sending Sykes into the gravel trap. Both riders headed for the pits.  After three laps, the race was suspended after another accident.  However, according to the regulations, neither BMW Motorrad WorldSBK  Team rider was allowed to compete in the restart. The sprint race was  shortened to five laps, with Folger finishing in 13th place. This  meant P10 for Sykes, P13 for van der Mark and P18 for Folger on the  grid for race two. At the beginning of the second race, Sykes fell and was then hit by  another rider. Sykes was taken to the circuit’s medical centre, where  initial diagnoses revealed a concussion. Further precautionary  investigations have since taken place in a Barcelona hospital. The accident led to the suspension of the race, which restarted after  a delay. Van der Mark crossed the line in ninth place. Folger secured  16th position. The WorldSBK now travels to Jerez de le Frontera in  southern Spain, where the tenth round of the season will take place  next weekend. Quotes after race two at Barcelona. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Our  main concern is that Tom is well. He is conscious and in hospital for  further checks at the moment. We have our fingers firmly crossed that  he has come through the crash relatively unscathed. It was not an easy  day. Unfortunately, Mickey also took out Tom when he crashed in this  morning’s Superpole race. As they had already completed three laps by  the time the red flag appeared, we were unfortunately unable to join  in when the Superpole race re-started. In race two, Tom fell and was  then unfortunately hit by another rider. Mickey was ninth in race two.  They were probably difficult conditions for many riders, but that was  obviously not the result we were striving for. It was a difficult end  to a weekend that actually started very positively.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “First of all, our thoughts are with Tom today. He has gone  for further checks at Barcelona Hospital. He has been talking and is  conscious which is a good sign so we will wait for further  information, however this really casts a shadow over the whole day. In  the Superpole race, both riders equally went down from an accident  caused by Mickey, which he has sincerely apologized to the team for.  In the second feature race, I think Mickey struggled to get his tyre  to work for him very early in the race but come the final third, he  had pace which was getting him where we expected him to be sort of the  third, fourth, fifth, sixth position, but by that point it was too  late, so it’s a scant reward for his weekend’s work in 9th position.  Now we will draw a line under Catalunya 2021 and move forward to  Jerez. But the main thing today is that we wish Tom a speedy recovery.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning in the Superpole race I made a mistake. I tried  to overtake Tom, but I was too fast and crashed and pushed Tom into  the gravel. It was a stupid mistake, so I am really sorry to the team.  In race two, I got a reasonable start, but unfortunately the red flag  was brought out because of Tom’s crash, from which I hope he is OK. At  the restart I struggled with the bike; we didn’t have any stopping  performance nor the grip I was aiming for, so it was a long and  difficult race. We have to find out the reason why this is happening  when the track conditions change. In the end we scored some points and  next week we have another chance.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was a tough  Sunday. We all had difficulties with the grip, but we are not able to  get the rear chassis working the way we want it to. As a result, I had  problems in the Superpole race and in race two. We will now take a  close look at the data and then hopefully take a step forward in Jerez  next weekend.” \n"}

The cause of the issue will now be analysed in detail. Privateer BMW Team LRP Poland was lying in 18th overall and in sixth  position in the EWC class with the #90 BMW S 1000 RR after 21 hours of  racing. Tecmas BMW (#9 BMW S 1000 RR) had to retire after a crash. The 84th edition of the Bol d’Or was the third round of the FIM EWC  2021 season. The final round, the 8-hour race at Most in the Czech  Republic, will be held on 9th October. Reactions. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “This  obviously is a hard setback for us, also in regards of the title fight  in the world championship. Another podium finish with a lot of  championship points would have been possible in this 24-hour race but  endurance racing once more proved that a lot can happen. Several top  teams have run into issues in this very hard race, and unfortunately  we have been one of them. We will now analyse in detail to find the  exact cause of the issue. I want to thank the entire team and the  riders for their very hard work before and at the race weekend. Now we  are looking forward to the finale at Most. There, we want to attack  again and fight at the very top.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “It’s very sad, for the riders and our entire team who all  worked so hard, but it can happen. We will leave that behind us and  our full focus is now on the next round at Most.” Markus Reiterberger: “We of course are all very  disappointed. The team tried everything to bring us back on track but  unfortunately we had to retire. It is very sad that the Le Castellet  weekend ended that way. But we will not get disheartened. Now, we will  prepare for Most where we will come back in full strength.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “We did a good job during this week.  We have again being always on top. In the race, we were running in P4,  just ten seconds behind P3. Our pace was very strong, like the leading  pace. Then we unfortunately suffered the technical issue. But okay, it  is endurance, and it’s a technical sport. Let’s forget this situation,  focus on the next one and prove that this team is capable of winning.” Kenny Foray: “For sure, it is very sad for us. I had  high hopes in the race, but it is like it is. We gave our very best  but this time it was not meant to be. It is difficult to find the  words to explain what I feel. It is not easy, but this is racing and  sometimes you win or are on the podium and sometimes you don’t finish.” \n"}

Tom Sykes (GBR)    proved unbeatable in the Superpole on his BMW M 1000 RR as he    claimed the sought-after spot at the front of the grid. In race one    that afternoon, his team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) was    involved in the battle to reach the podium and finished fifth on the    wet circuit. Sykes crossed the finish line in eighth place. Jonas    Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing Team finished the first race    in 19th position. Sykes posted a time of 1:40.408 minutes, nearly three-tenths of a  second faster than his rivals, to claim his third pole position with  BMW in the morning Superpole qualification session, his 51st WorldSBK  pole overall. Van der Mark qualified in ninth place. Folger finished  the Superpole in 18th position. The weekend at Barcelona had been dry thus far, but rain set in just  as the grid was forming up for race one. The riders chose wet-weather  tyres to deal with the conditions around the circuit. Pole-sitter Sykes endured some bad luck at the start. His rear wheel  started spinning on the paint as he pulled away, dropping him back  down to 15th place. Van der Mark remained in ninth after the start,  before starting to make his move up through the field. He had reached  fifth place by lap two and moved into fourth with a great manoeuvre on  lap seven. He was now battling for a podium finish and moved to within  0.1 seconds of the top three. When leader Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR \/  Yamaha) retired on the 15th lap, van der Mark was able to claim third  for a while before dropping two places. Van der Mark then closed up on  Jonathan Rea (GBR \/ Kawasaki) again during the final laps, before  crossing the line in fifth place, six and a half seconds behind winner  Scott Redding (GBR \/ Ducati). On lap one, Sykes moved up from 15th to  tenth place. He then returned to the top eight on the next lap and  completed the race in eighth position. Folger finished a difficult  race in 19th position. Quotes after race one at Barcelona. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Overall, that was a mixed day for us. Of course, it was  fantastic for Tom to get pole position in Superpole and we are also  very pleased with Michael’s performance in the race having started  from ninth and was then involved in the battle for the podium.  Unfortunately, his tyres started to wear during the final laps. But he  did cross the line just a few seconds off the podium places. This is  good, and means we have one good race in the bag. Unfortunately, Tom  had some bad luck at the start and wasn’t able to turn his pole  position into a result. It was a shame that he fell back so far. Now  we will see what the weather tomorrow brings. I will be heading on to  Le Castellet where we are competing in the Bol d’Or with the BMW  Motorrad World Endurance Team. I wish this team the very best of luck  as well, and we hope that regular rider Xavi Forés recovers from his  injuries swiftly.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Firstly, it was a great Superpole lap from Tom. An  unbelievable lap time. Mickey didn’t do so bad qualifying for the  third row in ninth. In race one, Tom unfortunately fell back to P15 at  the start. Mickey did well to break through from P9 and was almost in  the podium position, but it’s days like today where we need to take  our opportunity. We need to speak to the riders and get their  feedback, but P5 and P8 isn’t such a bad result. But Tom starting from  pole; he will be disappointed with that. Let’s see what tomorrow  brings, hopefully we can go a bit better.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning in FP3 I felt really good. I had good pace  after making some changes to the bike which I felt comfortable with.  In Superpole I was quite happy with my laps. P9 on the grid wasn’t  ideal, but I knew we had a good bike for the race. The race then was  wet. I had an OK start and got into a good rhythm and started to pass  people. At a certain point in the race I was feeling really confident  but I felt the bike spinning as soon as I picked the bike up out of  the corner, especially compared to the other riders. For me it was an  enjoyable race but it was also really frustrating as I had the feeling  that if I had a little more grip on the exit I could have been up  there fighting for the podium. Anyway, this is another race done and  we learnt a lot from it. We have to find the solution when it’s wet  again to get more drive grip.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It obviously  was great to get pole position in Superpole but then at the race  start, I went from pole position to 15th. In the rainy conditions I  got on a lot of paint on the track after half a metre so the bike spun  up twice. It was unfortunate because in the early laps we had good  speed and then everybody seemed to go quite flat so it was difficult  to make the difference, so it was a disappointment but it is like it  is. The bike was working very good in a lot of areas, just missing  entry grip on the rear. This is something to look after for tomorrow  and then we will get our next chance.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I had hoped that we  would be able to benefit from the rain and move up by a few places.  However, the opposite turned out to be the case. I don’t know why, but  I had hardly any grip. Maybe it was because we did not use the chassis  completely for rain setup. We will have to see what the others did but  I think that this was the main reason why I had no grip, causing me to  lose time lap after lap. Now I hope that it stays dry tomorrow. We had  been doing well in the dry and maybe we will be able to score more  points tomorrow.” \n"}

The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team will start    the Bol d’Or in Le Castellet (FRA), which is the third round of the    2021 FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC), from third on the    grid with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR. Only the times of Markus    Reiterberger (GER) and Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) were classified for    qualifying, as the third regular rider, Xavi Forés (ESP), was unable    to participate after picking up an injury in Thursday’s practice    session in a crash that was not his fault. The team’s fourth rider,    Kenny Foray (FRA) will alternate with Reiterberger and Mikhalchik in    the race. Forés was hit and knocked off his bike by another rider in practice  and injured his shoulder in the fall. As he was unable to start in the  two qualifying sessions on Thursday and Friday, the grid position for  the #37 M RR was calculated taking the average of the fastest times  set by Reiterberger and Mikhalchik in their sessions. Reiterberger’s  best time of 1:53.617 minutes came on Friday morning, as did  Mikhalchik’s fastest lap of 1:53.623 minutes. This produced an average  time of 1:53.620 minutes. The 84th Bol d’Or gets underway at 15:00 CEST on Saturday 18th  September. The race finishes 24 hours later. The privateer BMW Team  LRP Poland (#90 BMW S 1000 RR) starts from ninth place, with Tecmas  BMW (#9 BMW S 1000 RR) 30th on the grid. Quotes after the Bol d’Or qualifying. Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “It has been a little bit mixed feelings, because on one side  we have Xavi’s injury, but, in general, I am very happy with  qualifying. As a team we are very strong. We did not use any  qualifying engine, but the lap times from Markus, Ilya and especially  Kenny, who is going to be our third rider in the race, were very good.  I am very happy to see that Kenny has the same rhythm as the others  and that he is in top form. Everything is well prepared and we are  ready to fight for the top places.” Markus Reiterberger: “Third place on the grid is  good, although I am not entirely satisfied with qualifying. I gave it  my all, but was a little unlucky with slipstreams. That is an  important factor here at this racetrack, especially when you are not  on a bike in special qualifying trim. We will now sit down together  and try to come up with the perfect package for the race. I think that  all three of us – Ilya, Kenny and myself – are superbly-set in terms  of our race pace. Unfortunately, Xavi cannot start. I wish him all the  best and a speedy recovery. It is going to be a long and hard race,  but we are ready.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am pretty happy with how the week  has gone so far. I feel good on the bike, even if it it’s not 100 per  cent perfect yet like it was at the test. We did not manage to put  together the ideal lap as we did at the test with Markus. But it is  good to start from P3 and we can rely on our strong race pace. We just  need to have a trouble-free race. We hope for good weather so we can  enjoy the riding during the 24-hours. So let’s see how it will go and  let’s fight until the end.” Xavi Forés: “Obviously, it was a bit unexpected for  me to finish the Bol d’Or weekend so early. It was a big shame to be  taken out on track due to another rider’s mistake and to not be able  to race this weekend. It also hurts especially as we are fighting for  the victory and for the title. So it’s not only painful for my  shoulder but also for my heart that I can’t help the team in that  task. My target is now to try to recover as fast as I can to be ready  and in a good shape for the season finale in Most. All the best to my  team-mates and to the team for the race – I cross my fingers for them  for another podium and more strong points for the championship.” Kenny Foray: “First of all, I am really sorry for  Xavi. That was not the plan and I know that it is very difficult for  him. I wish him a speedy recovery. I am ready for the race. I feel  good on the bike, I love this race, I love this track and I love this  bike. I will give my all and am confident that we can have a strong race.” \n"}

For BMW Motorrad Motorsport, the action comes thick    and fast over the next few weeks in the FIM Superbike World    Championship (WorldSBK), with three race weekends in a row. First,    this weekend (17th to 19th September), is the ninth event of the    season at Circuit de Catalunya near Barcelona (ESP). The BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team and its riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael    van der Mark (NED), as well as Bonovo MGM Racing and Jonas Folger    (GER), then head south to the Iberian Peninsula. Rounds ten and    eleven of the season will then take place at Jerez de la Frontera    (ESP) and Portimão (POR). Circuit de Catalunya hosted WorldSBK for the first time last year.  This spring, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Bonovo MGM Racing  completed extensive tests at Jerez de la Frontera and Barcelona, where  they prepared their BMW M 1000 RRs for the season ahead. The BMW  Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Sykes also attended another Barcelona test  in hot conditions this August. Jerez de la Frontera, where round ten of this season’s WorldSBK will  take place from 24th to 26th September, has been a fixture on the  calendar for many years. The same goes for Portimão on the Portuguese  Algarve, venue for the eleventh event of the season from 1st to 3rd  October. The triple being held in Spain and Portugal marks the end of  the European leg of WorldSBK for BMW Motorrad Motorsport, before the  series moves on to the two overseas events in Argentina and Indonesia  in October and November. Quotes ahead of the WorldSBK triple header. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Some  intensive weeks await us in WorldSBK. With three back-to-back race  weekends, we have a demanding programme ahead of us. However, we are  looking forward to the challenge. Barcelona may still be a relatively  new hunting ground in WorldSBK, but we were already able to gather  important information there during this year’s tests to have a good  base. It was also helpful to get out on the track there in summery  conditions in August as we have to expect high temperatures at the  next races, especially at Jerez de la Frontera and Portimão. Our goal  is to get the triple-header off to a strong start with our M RRs in  Barcelona, then to carry the momentum into the remaining races in the  south of the Iberian Peninsula.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “At Magny-Cours, the two sides of the garage had different  issues but all are working to overcome that. The aim for the next race  at Barcelona and the coming triple-header is to build on our test work  that we did there in pre-season and recently with Tom also. We are  confident we can once again hit the ground running in FP1 with a very  good pace. We know that we can be competitive at Catalunya, we have  proved that in the past. The temperatures will be pretty high and we  know we need to manage that with the bike. Overall, we are keen to be  back on track again; it is going to be very hectic and very hard work  for the mechanics and the entire team working on three back-to-back  races so we need to plan our work very efficiently and we prepare  ourselves. I think it will be once again critical that we start FP1  and FP2 and go into qualifying with a very good pace and give  ourselves a real chance in the races by qualifying on the front two  rows where possible and we are hopeful that we can do that.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am really  looking forward to the next three rounds of the World Superbike  Championship. To be honest, it’s a little bit different approach now;  I don’t remember in all of my years racing that we had three  back-to-back races so that’s definitely a quite intense part of the  championship. It will be three exciting circuits and ones that I  really enjoy so starting in Catalunya we can hopefully find a little  bit more form and continue the run that we had there the last time we  visited. Plus we also had a test there recently to get some more  information so I am overall looking forward to the run of these three  races and trying to gain many more points for the championship.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I  always love to ride my race bike and I think we can be still very  happy that we can do so many races this year so I am looking forward  to the triple-header. In addition, we are going to three of my  favourite race tracks in a row, so that’s also not so bad. We tested  at Barcelona in spring and it is good to come there again and see  where we improved. I think that we have shown at Magny-Cours that we  are getting closer to the podium. Of course, I want to fight for the  podium and we are getting closer. At Magny-Cours, we were unlucky with  a few things but our goal for sure is to fight again for these  positions. I think the general package has improved and our goal is to  fight for the podium on the coming weekends.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Firstly, I am  looking forward to Barcelona, as we had a good test there in the  spring. We are now looking to implement some of that at the race  weekend and adapt one or two of the settings. It is also a great  circuit which really suits me. I hope I can make the most of that and  that we can score a good haul of points. We attended our very first  test with BMW at Jerez de la Frontera, and I know the track just as  well as I do the Barcelona circuit because I have ridden there many  times in the past. I am obviously hoping that we continue to see an  upward trend there and can pick up some points. In contrast, Portimão  is new territory for me. I don’t know the circuit. I have watched many  videos of MotoGP and the Superbike World Championship, and it appears  to be a very demanding circuit, which is often referred to as  ‘rollercoaster’. However, I am really looking forward to this new  challenge and am already very excited about the ‘rollercoaster ride’  at Portimão.”  Track Facts Barcelona.Circuit        length4.627          km – clockwiseCorners14 – 8 right-handers, 6 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight900 metresGrip levelMedium \/ lowTrack        layoutVery          long straight, flowing sectionsStrain on        brakesMediumAmount at full        throttle27 %Top speed \/ lowest        speed312          km\/h \/ 58 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityT1Key        factorsTraction, engine performance  Track Facts Jerez de la Frontera.Circuit        length4.432          km – clockwiseCorners13 – 8 right-handers, 5 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight580 metresGrip levelMediumTrack        layoutPartly long corner, hard braking zonesStrain on        brakesMedium \/ highAmount at full        throttle25 %Top speed \/ lowest        speed283          km\/h \/ 59 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityT1, T6, T13Key        factorsGood          delay, agility  Track Facts Portimão.Circuit        length4.592          km – clockwiseCorners15 – 9 right-handers, 6 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight770 metresGrip levelMediumTrack        layoutSignificant changes in elevation, more slower          sections but also fast corners with compressionStrain on        brakesMedium \/ lowAmount at full        throttle20 %Top speed \/ lowest        speed308          km\/h \/ 52 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityT5Key        factorsStability, confidence in the front, good turn-in \n"}

Du Bois, and Amiri  Baraka–to create a multisensory space that fosters an active and  collective practice of listening.Calla Henkel & Max Pitegoff (born 1988 in  Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA \/ 1987 in Buffalo, New York, USA; both  live in Berlin)Over the past ten years, Calla Henkel and Max  Pitegoff have developed a practice rooted in documentary photography  which has captured the socio-urban development of Berlin from their  perspective within the city’s artistic community. Their spaces Times  Bar, New Theater and, currently, their TV Bar have shaped the Berlin  art scene of recent years. In the photographic series “Exteriors”  (2021) and “Collective Image (Klärwerk Ruhleben)” (2021), the duo  examines utopian projections and underlying realities in order to  offer a view on urban development in Berlin and the unseen, peripheral  moments of city living. In addition, they are presenting a trailer for  “Paradise” (since 2020), an ongoing television series filmed at TV  Bar. The first two episodes of the series will be shown parallel to  the exhibition in bars and independent spaces around the city,  including Bierhaus Urban, Hopscotch Reading Room, Eschschloraque, and  Restaurant im Hamburger Bahnhof.Sandra Mujinga (born 1989 in Goma, Democratic  Republic of the Congo; lives in Berlin and Oslo)In her work,  Sandra Mujinga negotiates economies of visibility and invisibility,  and questions around identity, self-representation and surveillance.  The notion of camouflage and invisibility as a survival strategy plays  a crucial role in her observations of existing socio-political  structures and power dynamics. She navigates both physical and digital  spaces to create images and spatial configuration for speculative  worlds which look beyond an anthropocentric paradigm. In the  exhibition, Mujinga is presenting two new sculptural ensembles:  “Reworlding Remains” (2021) and “Sentinels of Change” (2021). Engaging  with principles of Afrofuturism and science fiction, and theories of  the posthuman, Mujinga deploys the strategy of worldbuilding in the  creation of fantastic figures and a schematic representation of a  dinosaur’s body bathed in green light.Sung Tieus (born 1987 in Hau Duong, Vietnam; lives in  Berlin)Life in the diaspora and its psychological consequences,  as well as the legacy of the Cold War and its lasting effects on  global capitalism are all recurring themes in the work of Sung Tieu  (born 1987 in Hai Duong, Vietnam, lives in Berlin). In her works she  often interlinks fact and fiction, historical and biographical events,  and a diverse array of lived social experiences. The installation  “Song for VEB Stern-Radio Berlin” (2021) draws on her interest in the  history of Vietnamese contract workers in the GDR. By incorporating  radios manufactured by contract workers in Berlin, Tieu’s installation  alludes directly to the city and its Vietnamese community. The radios  activate the space acoustically and create a dense weave of  readymades, texts and sound that give occasion to think about the  relationship between work and life, and between individuals and systems. \n"}
{"prompt":"Deloitte orders 140 MINI Electric to meet growing demand for electric cars: MINI Electric largest order in Europe so far. ->","completion":" More and more young people are opting for an electric company car: at  Deloitte alone, 26% of employees do. To meet this growing demand,  Deloitte has ordered 140 electric MINIs. According to BMW, this is the  largest order of fully electric MINIs in Europe so far. With an  additional charging infrastructure, Deloitte wants to make a  significant contribution to climate neutrality.Deloitte added the first 100 MINI Electric to its fleet back in  August last year. Now the company announces that it is adding 140 new  MINI Electric to its electric fleet. Deloitte's fleet now has 240 MINI  Electric. The fully electric MINIs with the eye-catching green  rear-view mirrors in Deloitte colour are particularly popular with new  employees. In total, Deloitte has ordered 540 new MINIs since June  this year.The growing popularity of electric cars at Deloitte goes hand in hand  with the increasing demand for hybrid vehicles at the company. As of  June 2021, electric and hybrid cars together account for 88% of all  company cars ordered at Deloitte. This clearly shows that employees  prefer sustainable alternatives to conventional cars with internal  combustion engines. In addition to purchasing electric cars, Deloitte  is investing heavily in its electric vehicle infrastructure. For  example, the Belgian office currently has 540 charging stations for  electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.\"All our investments in sustainable mobility are part of  Deloitte's goal to be CO2 neutral by 2030. As our fleet accounts for  70% of our carbon footprint, every small and big step brings us closer  to carbon neutrality. That's why we launched a new mobility programme  in 2017. We have also been working successfully with MINI for many  years and I am delighted that we are working with them to increase  enthusiasm for electric cars at Deloitte. The fact that one in four  new employees now chooses an electric car gives me full confidence  that we are on the right track to make Deloitte a pioneer in  sustainable mobility,\" says Piet Vandendriessche, CEO of Deloitte Belgium. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.comThe BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the    BMW Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles    and motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility    services.

Century  Motorsport and its two drivers Gus Burton and Will Burns (both GBR)  wrapped up both the Driver and Team titles at the penultimate event of  the season at Oulton Park (GBR). Burton and Burns already had one hand on the trophy after race one on  Saturday in which they finished runner-up with the #57 BMW M4 GT4. In  race two on Sunday, the duo produced a drive worthy of champions to  win the title. With torrential rain causing perilous conditions,  Burton and Burns took their third victory of the season. That was  enough to give them an unassailable lead in the Drivers’ Championship  as well as in the Silver category. Century Motorsport was also crowned  champion in the Team competition with races to spare. “To be GT4 champions is just incredible. What a weekend,” said Burns.  Burton added: “Century have done such a superb job with the car. It  felt great, even in conditions like those. And the strategy has been  spot-on all season.

Horschel secured the title at the third Rolex Series event of the    year, and his second major BMW title after the BMW Championship in    Denver (USA) with an excellent final round of 65 (7 under par) and a    birdie at the 18th hole. There was also plenty of suspense around    the question of who would claim the final three qualification spots    on the Ryder Cup Team Europe, and fans were kept guessing until late    in the final round.“On behalf of everyone at BMW, I would like to congratulate Billy  Horschel for winning the 2021 BMW PGA Championship,” said Chris  Brownridge, Chief Executive Officer BMW Group UK. “It has been  fantastic to see spectators safely back at Wentworth in person this  year and we have all been treated to an exciting tournament in return.”A thrilling final round at times featured 15 players in with a chance  of the title but it was Horschel who proved most adept at keeping his  nerve. In the end, seven birdies without a single dropped shot were  the key to the first victory for an American golfer at an event in the  prestigious Rolex series. The 2014 FedExCup champion only pulled clear  of the field on the final hole, taking a brilliant approach shot and  following that up with a tap-in birdie.“It feels amazing. We are talking about winning majors, the Players  Championship and a few other events, but after having been here in  2019, I added the BMW PGA Championship to that list,” said Horschel.  “In my opinion this is equal to winning a Players Championship. The  names on this trophy are legends in their own right. To be the second  American to win this event is amazing. There is something about me  playing well in BMW tournaments – I have to find some more BMW events  around the world.”Second place was shared by Kiradech Aphibarnrat (THA), Jamie  Donaldson (WAL) and Laurie Canter (ENG, all -18), ahead of Christiaan  Bezuidenhout (RSA, -17). Justin Rose, Andrew ‘Beef’ Johnston (both  ENG) and Francesco Laporta (ITA, all -16) followed tied in sixth.The BMW PGA Championship was the final tournament at which European  players had the chance to score points for the Ryder Cup. Four of the  nine qualification places were still mathematically up for grabs.  However, there was only a theoretical chance that England’s Matthew  Fitzpatrick and Tyrrell Hatton would miss out on qualification, so a  thrilling battle developed for the remaining three spots between Bernd  Wiesberger, Lee Westwood, and Shane Lowry. Wiesberger gave the most  solid performance over four rounds, becoming the first-ever Austrian  to qualify for the Ryder Cup. The advantage swung back and forth from  Westwood to Lowry, culminating in a heart-stopping finale on Sunday  that saw the Englishman claim the upper hand.Lowry’s dream of participating in the Ryder Cup for the first time  will still come true, however, as captain Padraig Harrington nominated  the Irish golfer as Captain’s Pick on Sunday at the Wentworth Club, as  was also the case for Ryder Cup legends Sergio García and Ian Poulter.  Jon Rahm (ESP), Rory McIlroy (NIR), Tommy Fleetwood (ENG), Viktor  Hovland (NOR) and Paul Casey (ENG) had already qualified for the  defending champions’ team before the BMW PGA Championship.The teams from the USA and Europe will face one another at Whistling  Straits (in the US state of Wisconsin) during the week after next  (21st to 26th September), which will also mark the debut of BMW as  Worldwide Partner of the Ryder Cup. The US team for the legendary and  emotionally charged team event will feature Collin Morikawa, Dustin  Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, Patrick  Cantlay, Tony Finau, Xander Schauffele, Jordan Spieth, Harris English,  Daniel Berger and Scottie Scheffler.\n"}

After six hours of racing, they claimed the    second spot on the podium. The new BMW M4 GT3 also made its debut at    the seventh NLS race, driven by Philipp Eng (AUT) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). The BMW Juniors secured fifth position on the grid in Saturday  morning’s qualifying session. A great, error-free performance from all  three drivers swiftly put the trio on course for the podium as they  battled for another win. They also set the fastest race lap with the  #44 BMW M6 GT3. Hesse, Harper and Verhagen finished second to secure  another podium, crossing the line less than 20 seconds behind the  victorious Manthey Porsche. The new BMW M4 GT3, which is still in the test and development phase,  made a racing debut out of competition in the SP-X prototype class.  Cars in this class have to start at the back of the GT3 field,  regardless of their result in qualifying. Farfus and Eng then worked  their way up into the top ten with the #55 BMW M4 GT3. Running the  tank to empty was part of the planning for the day, and the car then  rolled to a stop at the entry to the pit lane once the fuel ran out in  the final minutes. The #35 BMW M6 GT3 from Walkenhorst Motorsport also recorded a top  six finish. Jörg Müller, Mario von Bohlen, Dennis Fetzer (all GER) and  Thomas Neubauer (FRA) finished in sixth position. Starting from tenth  on the grid, David Pittard (GBR) sprinted up to second in the #34  Walkenhorst Motorsport BMW M6 GT3, before a double dose of tyre damage  knocked him and his team-mates Christian Krognes (NOR) and Ben Tuck  (GBR) a long way back. The team’s #36 BMW M6 GT3, driven by Henry  Walkenhorst, Jörg Breuer and Andreas Ziegler (all GER), crossed the  line in 14th place overall, and in second place in the SP9 AM class. This was a first taste of the Nordschleife for Jake Dennis (GBR).  Having finished third in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship  2021, he had made his GT racing debut for BMW M Motorsport last  weekend in the Fanatec GT World Challenge Endurance Cup and is now  aiming for his Nordschleife permit. In the seventh NLS race, Dennis  shared driving duties with Niklas Krütten (GER) in the #652 BMW M240i  Racing from the Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive. The duo  claimed second place in the BMW M240i class. Reactions after round seven of the 2021 NLS. Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport: “We had a  successful day all round on the Nordschleife. Congratulations to our  three BMW Juniors Max, Dan and Neil – they battled for their next NLS  win right up to the final lap in their BMW M6 GT3 and can be very  satisfied with second place. The three gave an error-free performance,  delivering impressive proof that they are certainly one of the real  top teams on the Nordschleife. Our new BMW M4 GT3 also enjoyed a  successful race debut. The car ran like clockwork and we had no  problems at all during yesterday’s testing or in qualifying and the  race today. Augusto and Philipp were delighted with the performance of  the BMW M4 GT3 and confirmed how great the BMW M4 GT3 drives on the  Nordschleife. Overall, we are very pleased with this NLS Saturday.” Max Hesse, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “It was a  good six-hour race for us. The team gave a top performance and it was  very, very close at the end. Of course, it was a bit of a shame that  we didn’t quite manage to grab the win but we will try to do that  again in two weeks. To be honest, the Manthey guys are really strong  here at the Nordschleife. The drivers are the reigning champions in  the 24-hour race and so we can really pleased to have kept the gap to  below 20 seconds after a six-hour race.” Neil Verhagen, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team: “When  you are so close to the win, it is obviously a bit bitter-sweet but I  think we can be super happy with today. BMW Team RMG, Max and Dan and  myself, I think we all achieved pretty much the maximum that we could  today. We knew that we really need to put everything together to be  competitive and that is exactly what we did. So I am super happy with  the team and with my team-mates. Thank you to BMW and to everybody  involved to make this possible because it was definitely not easy. We  fought over the entire race and it was just down to the wire. Now we  keep pushing to return to the top step.” Dan Harper, #44 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team:  “Overall, I am very happy with the result. Obviously on the  back of two wins, the second place and even being so close to first  place, can be a bit disappointing but we can for sure be very happy.  The team and us three drivers we have done a good job, we achieved the  maximum that was possible and collected good points for the  championship. And it is always nice to spray some champagne.” Philipp Eng, #55 BMW M4 GT3: “That was so much fun.  It was an honour for me to complete the debut race for the BMW M4 GT3  together with Augusto. The car drives extremely well. If you compare  it with the BMW M6 GT3, it is even easier to drive but the performance  is even better. The Nordschleife was a busy place again today and I  had a few situations with other cars but it helped that you can  overtake offline with the BMW M4 GT3 too, without getting yourself  into trouble right away. Overall, I feel that it went great. The race  was smooth and I would be happy to start the 24-hour race with this  car right away.” Augusto Farfus, #55 BMW M4 GT3: “It was a very  emotional day because I remember my first rollout in Dingolfing and  after so many months, we come to the Nordschleife and I did the first  race start with the new BMW M4 GT3. It was just great. Thanks to BMW  who did an amazing job, the car ran trouble-free. We could experience  and measure the speed of the car against the competition so it was a  great lesson today. The car feels very, very good and I can’t wait to  be back at the Nordschleife with the car.” Jake Dennis, #652 BMW M240i Racing: “It was fantastic  to finally experience the Nordschleife. It certainly lived up to my  expectations. Everybody had warned me how difficult it is and entire  circuit is just impressive. There is not really one combination what  makes it superior to any other, it is just 25 kilometres of challenge.  It is so on the edge and when the conditions are mixed as well, as we  had them in this morning’s qualifying, it makes life even more  challenging. But that’s part of the Nordschleife and that’s what makes  it so special. It has been a great experience and the BMW M240i Racing  is a great car to learn the circuit. And to finish second in the class  was obviously very nice.”  \n"}

The 24-hour Bol d’Or on 18th\/19th September at Circuit Paul    Ricard in Le Castellet (FRA) is round three of the 2021 FIM EWC    season. Alternating in the saddle of the #37 BMW M 1000 RR will once    again be Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Xavi    Forés (ESP). Kenny Foray (FRA) is also in Le Castellet as the team’s    fourth rider. In preparation for the famous endurance race, the BMW Motorrad World  Endurance Team attended a two-day test in Le Castellet last week. The  team, led by team principal Werner Daemen, and the four riders  fine-tuned the set-up of the #37 M RR, ready to take on the challenges  of the 24-hour race. The test was a successful one and the team set  the fastest time on both days – with a new lap record on each  occasion. On Tuesday, Mikhalchik topped the standings with a new  record of 1:53.261 minutes on the #37 bike. Reiterberger then went  even faster on the Wednesday, setting a new record of 1:52.484 minutes. The last time the Bol d’Or took place, in September 2019, the BMW  Motorrad World Endurance Team was making its debut in the FIM EWC.  Back then the team finished third with the #37 BMW S 1000 RR to claim  a spot on the podium at the first attempt. The team has also finished  third on the new #37 BMW M 1000 RR in each of the two races that have  been held so far in the 2021 season – the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA)  and the 12 Hours of Estoril (POR). The BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team lies third in the world championship with 80 points, seven less  than the leaders. The race weekend in Le Castellet kicks off on  Wednesday 15th September with scrutineering. This is followed on  Thursday 16th September by the first practice and qualifying sessions.  On Tuesday 14th September, another private test day will be held. As well as the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, the privateer BMW  teams Tecmas BMW 9 (#9 BMW S 1000 RR), Team univers racing\/ACRacing  #23 (#23 BMW S 1000 RR) and LRP Poland (#90 BMW S 1000 RR) also  compete in the Bol d’Or. Quotes ahead of the Bol d’Or. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  Bol d’Or is one of the biggest classics in motorcycle racing. Our  debut in the FIM EWC in Le Castellet two years ago was unforgettable.  Finishing on the podium at the first attempt was very special. Since  then, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team has proven that this  success was no flash in the pan. It has established itself among the  world’s elite, first with the BMW S 1000 RR and now with the BMW M  1000 RR. Last week’s test was very promising and gives us momentum  ahead of the race weekend. However, we know that nothing is guaranteed  in an endurance race, and that is particularly true of 24-hour races.  Our goal is to impress with a strong performance at the Bol d’Or. The  ingredients are there to achieve that: a superbly coordinated and  experienced team, an extremely competitive motorbike, and strong, fast  and experienced riders. We are well equipped to face the challenges of  the Bol d’Or. If everything goes to plan in the race, we can continue  the success story of the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “The test last week was really good. We still had some small  issues, but this is normal. The team found a good set-up; we have been  the fastest on both days, we broke the lap record on both days, and  this with two different riders, which is also important. All four  riders did a very good job. Kenny, of course, who knows the track very  well, and then Xavi, who was there for the first time, was really fast  and showed his potential with good lap times. Also Ilya and Markus  were fast as always and concentrated. I think we are well prepared for  the race. Of course, a 24-hour race is a 24-hour race, but we are  confident we can show another strong performance at this year’s Bol d’Or.” Markus Reiterberger: “On the first day of the test I  first had to refamiliarise myself with the circuit, as the last time I  was here was back in 2015 and there have been a few changes since  then. However, I adapted really quickly and set the second fastest  time behind my team-mate Ilya, who set a new record. We had good pace,  but still tried out a few things on the bike. On the second day I was  really happy with my race pace and the long runs. I was super quick  and consistent. At the end of day two I also set a new record. To have  ridden the fastest lap ever on a motorcycle in Le Castellet is very  cool. However, what is far more important is the race pace, and we are  excellently positioned with our bike in that sense. We will now  fine-tune our package a bit between now and the race. Our goal for the  race is to win. The podium is the least we are aiming for, victory  would be fantastic. We have the package to achieve it, the team will  do a superb job of preparing the bike, and we are really well  positioned with our trio of riders and our fast fourth rider. I am  looking forward to the Bol d’Or.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “Last week we had a really positive  test. We have been really fast and set two lap records. Our pace was  very strong during the long stints. We also tried a few tyres for the  race but also for the fast lap. I am confident that we are ready to  fight for the top positions. Me personally, I tried a lot of things,  especially on day two, and several settings on the bike. I had a very  good feeling for the bike, and it worked very well on new as well as  on used tyres. This is really important for the endurance race. I am  very happy and looking forward to the race.” Xavi Forés: “It was a very positive test for me. I  was there only for one day, as I had to go back to the UK for the  British Superbike Championship. It was an amazing day for me as I  could learn the layout of the track as I had never been there before.  I really enjoyed riding there; I was fast and consistent as well on my  laps. I did a long stint trying to stay focused on the race pace and I  think we did quite well. So I am looking forward to the race. It is  going to be a very important race for us because we are fighting for  the championship. It will be a very long race. We have to stay very  focused and make no mistakes. If we can do that, I think we have the  pace and are strong enough to fight for the victory. I can’t wait to  start and see what the race weekend brings.” Kenny Foray: “It was a really good test for us. The  race pace of the bike was great for all of us four riders. This is  good for the race. Of course, you can never know what happens in the  race because it goes over 24 hours, but I think that we are ready.” \n"}
{"prompt":"Visions for sustainable mobility and cities designed for excellent quality of living, fresh stimuli for the MINI community and a clear commitment to diversity: with its ‘BIG LOVE from Munich’ campaign the British premium brand left its mark at the International Motor Show and not only with the large-format mural on the tower of “Sugar Mountain” designed by the artist Lakwena.  ->","completion":"  Munich. #BIGLOVE is the MINI way of showing how two  small words can inspire positive action. Ever since the brand was born  in 1959, MINI has been all about doing more with less and finding the  most creative ways to use space. The current campaign being run by the  British premium brand goes one step further. #BIGLOVE is an expression  of diversity embraced in practice in all its forms, welcoming fresh  thinking and new ideas no matter where they come from. At the IAA  Mobility 2021 in Munich, the MINI brand presented its path towards  more sustainable mobility and an inclusive future for everyone based  on the claim “We’re all different, but pretty good together”.For the duration of the trade fair, under the motto “BIG LOVE from  Munich”, MINI contributed to the revitalisation of the vibrant  industrial site in the suburbs of Munich called “Sugar Mountain”,  which focuses on creativity, sport, personal fulfilment and community.  The site of the former concrete factory is now enhanced by a  multi-coloured mural on an old tower, designed by London-based artist  Lakwena Maciver especially for the occasion. Lakwena’s artistic style  thrives on bold statements and bright colours. Her aim is to make art  accessible to everyone. This is why she mainly paints in public  spaces, bringing art to people who might otherwise not have access to  it. This approach makes her the perfect partner for MINI, conveyed in  the messages that appear in her colourful mural with the words  “DIFFERENT BUT GOOD TOGETHER” and “BIG LOVE”. The installation will  continue to embellish the district of Obersendling in Munich after the  IAA Mobility 2021 is over.Sugar Mountain represented the kick-off of MINI’s IAA “Big love from  Munich” campaign with MINI friends taking part in a wide range of  activities here. Exciting matches on the World Club Tennis Court,  high-speed races on the BMX pump track and laid-back tricks on the Jam  Skate Park – they had plenty of space to spontaneously engage in  sports or express their own personal style. There was also the  opportunity to improve their DJ skills at a DJ set master class, with  the sound of relaxed beats providing the perfect background for people  to meet and relax in the spacious community area.Furthermore, adventurers and outdoor lovers alike experienced an  urban campsite with the AUTOHOME special edition roof tents for the  MINI Countryman. The roof tents, produced for the first time with  recycled materials, are made with bottles collected from the ocean and  fully match the brand’s design and the MINI pioneering spirit, where  every day offers new sustainable adventures and perspectives.MINI’s IAA BIG LOVE campaign continued in the MINI Pavillon at  Lenbachplatz in Munich where visitors were able to take part in a  variety of activities from culinary to sport. With displays created by  British fashion designer Paul Smith, the MINI Pavilion was also  transformed into a fascinating and versatile hotspot for fresh ideas.  The MINI STRIP, a custom-made one-off car by Paul Smith in  collaboration with MINI, presented here focused on the topics of  sustainability and innovation for increased environmental protection.  The MINI STRIP shines the spotlight on an innovative approach to the  issue of sustainability in automotive manufacturing. Guided by the  overarching theme of ‘Simplicity, Transparency, Sustainability’, the  car showcases inspirational ideas for a more sustainable method of  automotive design.Visitors also had the opportunity to find out about the future design  of individual mobility and urban living spaces through displays and  panel discussions involving designers and visionaries from the  creative tech start-ups that are being supported in connection with  the MINI Start-up Accelerator URBAN-X. The ideas presented were then  debated live with thought leaders from the dialogue platform “The  Sooner Now” under the motto “The city of tomorrow is made today”.This dialogue between visionaries and the MINI community during the  IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich was thus entirely dedicated to the crucial  issues of our time facing MINI: urban mobility, sustainability,  cosmopolitanism and individuality. In this way, the future-oriented  brand was able to leave behind positive stimuli and a feeling that  lasts – #BIGLOVE. In case of queries, please contact:Press and PRSarah Bauer, Press Officer Product Communication MINITelephone: +49-89-382-94180E-mail sarah.bauer@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-23662E-mail andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW MotorradTelephone: +49-89-382-35108E-mail jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

BMW M Motorsport has taken another important step    towards entering the LMDh class in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar    Championship (IMSA series) from the 2023 season. The chassis for the    two prototype cars will be produced in close collaboration with the    globally-renowned and successful manufacturer Dallara. The contract    was signed on Wednesday at the Dallara headquarters in Varano de    Melegari (ITA).  “In Dallara, we are delighted to have found a partner for our LMDh  project that shares our passion, professionalism and huge ambition in  motorsport and, like us, is fully committed to the goal of writing a  new success story in the history of BMW M Motorsport from 2023,” said  Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH, during his trip to Italy. He took  the opportunity, along with Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport, and  Maurizio Leschiutta, head of the LMDh project, to check out the  outstanding development and test capabilities that Dallara has to  offer. “After speaking to all the possible chassis partners, the  decisive factor in our decision was that Dallara, with all its  expertise and experience, was enthusiastic about working together with  BMW M Motorsport. The chemistry was there between us from the word go.  We see our relationship as a real partnership in which we are fighting  for a common goal of success at the racetrack.” Flasch, Krack and Leschiutta met in Varano de Melegari for  discussions with the lead Dallara engineers and visited the key areas  of the company, including the composite department, its own wind  tunnel and the test track in Varano (ITA). The first test car will be  built in Italy in a close collaboration between BMW M Motorsport  engineers and a team of Dallara engineers assembled specifically for  the BMW LMDh project. The rollout will take place next year at the  Varano circuit. “Dallara is perhaps the most successful race car manufacturer in the  world and has already played a key role in virtually every relevant  circuit racing series,” said Leschiutta. “As well as the desire to  work with us, several other criteria were of great importance when  making our decision. Dallara is a company that covers the full range  of requirements. Its expertise extends to the fields of chassis  manufacturing, engineering, development, wind tunnel tests, and  simulations. They are very strong when it comes to aerodynamics, which  will be a key factor in the IMSA series. In order to ensure that our  cars are ideally prepared from the outset and to lay the foundations  for success at the racetrack, we are already working closely with  Dallara at a very early stage of development.” \"I'm honoured to have been selected by BMW M Motorsport and with  great enthusiasm I'm looking forward to begin this new adventure”,  said Giampaolo Dallara, President of Dallara. “Back in 1977 I had the  opportunity to work alongside BMW on designing the M1 as Lamborghini  consulting. It was a great experience and a lot was learned. I hope to  repeat the same adventure in LMDh. I firmly believe that we will do  great things together.\" Andrea Pontremoli, CEO and General Manager of Dallara, added:  \"Our partnership with BMW M Motorsport is the result of almost 50  years of work in the motorsport industry, engineering and race car  development. It is a privilege to have been selected by BMW for their  next and new challenge in the hybrid prototype racing world. The LMDh  concept and the convergence between IMSA, ACO and FIA has no  precedence in history and that will see our total commitment. We are  looking forward to compete in this new and exciting chapter of the  global motorsport at its highest level.\" Note to editors:                A new episode of the “MBEDDED” video series will be created on the  BMW Motorsport YouTube channel, focusing on the partnership with  Dallara.

At the International Motor Show (IAA)  Mobility 2021, which will take place from September 7 to 12 in Munich,  the BMW Group will be showcasing in a variety of ways what premium  urban mobility could look like in the future. One example of this is  the Automated Valet Parking project, which was developed together with  the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) and other  partners. For the first time, interested parties will have the  opportunity to experience automated and driverless parking and service  functions up close in a unique demonstration. The focus of the impressive demonstration is the new technology  flagship of the BMW Group, the BMW iX. As an innovator in the  development fields of software, digital services and networking, the  fully electric SUV is able to communicate with the infrastructure  and  to carry out automated, driverless parking processes. Particular  attention is paid to the safety of the driving maneuvers and the data  exchange required for this between the vehicle, smartphone app and  parking garage infrastructure. In doing so, the BMW Group is  underlining that safety always has the highest priority. In addition  to the complete parking process, viewers experience other automated  service functions such as washing or charging the BMW iX with the help  of robots. The demonstrations will take place during the entire IAA Mobility  2021 from 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. in the parking garage West at Messe  München. A shuttle service connects the main entrance of Messe Ost  with the parking garage West. An IAA ticket is not required for the visit.\n"}

Michael van der Mark    (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished sixth and eighth    on his BMW M 1000 RR. His team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) was twelfth in    the Superpole race and went on to finish tenth in race two. Jonas    Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team came home 18th and 16th. Sunday at Magny-Cours began with the warm-up in the morning, in which  Sykes, van der Mark and Folger were fourth, ninth and 15th fastest.  That was followed by the Superpole race. After a strong qualifying,  Sykes again started from third on the grid, with van der Mark ninth  and Folger 19th. Sykes initially established his position in the leading group at the  start of the Superpole race, however fell back to eleventh place on  lap two. Van der Mark gradually worked his way through the field and  was running fifth at the halfway point, before dropping a position.  The Dutchman ended the ten-lap sprint in sixth place, which put him on  the second row of the grid for race two on Sunday afternoon. Sykes  came home twelfth, which earned him tenth place on the grid for the  second race. Folger finished 18th in the Superpole race. Folger was  promoted one position from 19th to 18th on the grid for race two, as  another rider was unable to start the race. Van der Mark made a strong start to race two and found himself in  fourth place for a brief spell but dropped back to sixth place on lap  six when he was touched by a rival whilst battling for fourth place,  the Dutchman just able to avoid crashing. He showed great fighting  spirit to battle back towards the front of the field, but was no  longer able to attack in the second half of the race. Van der Mark  dropped back to eighth place, a position he held on to through to the  finish. Sykes endured a difficult start, after which he was lagging in  18th place. However, he fought his way back to 14th on the opening  lap. By the end of lap seven, he was running in tenth place – a  position he maintained through to the end of the 21-lap race. Folger  also made a poor start, but improved in the second half of the race  and took the chequered flag in 16th place. Quotes after race two at Magny-Cours. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Tom’s had a really tough day to be honest. He’s not got into  his rhythm and got beat up a bit in both races and lost places. We  know the top ten are so close together and I don’t think Tom has had a  fair crack at it today so he will be disappointed with his  performance. Mickey had a good Superpole race. I think he did really  good to come through there, he had a good battle so to start the  feature race from sixth position was a really good step. It was a  strange race really. He got away really well and was in a tough battle  with the front guys. Then Andrea Locatelli made a hard but fair move  on Michael but it looks like the brake guard did its job and saved him  from what could have been a major accident because the gyroscopic  effect of the bike pulled Andrea back into the side of Mickey and he  had nowhere to go so it was very lucky. But he fought back and used a  lot of tyre which towards the end left him with no grip so eighth  position is all we could do today. A good race overall from Mickey and  I think we can come away from Magny-Cours with some positives. We have  tested at Catalunya, so we are looking forward to going there next.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning’s Superpole race was alright. I had good pace  and had a good feeling with the bike. I was just missing one or two  tenths to stay with Scott Redding and fight for fourth place. I was  confident going into the main race and had a strong start but then I  started to struggle after a few laps. I had some moments with a few  riders and lost a lot of time there but at the moment, the package is  just not good enough to fight every corner with the other guys. In  some corners we are losing too much time.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was  difficult today. Put me on a clear track and I can go front row, put  me on a clear track again in warm up and we can be consistently in the  top four. We just cannot ride with the others. Unfortunately, when I’m  with the other riders it becomes a lot more stop and start and we  can’t follow them when it comes to opening the gas. As soon as I got  clear track my lap times came down and were not too far from the fifth  position in terms of lap time, but we can’t bridge the gap at this  level. There’s a lot of information to be looked at, I will see with  the team where we can improve.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I struggled in the  races when the tank was full, particularly on the opening laps. I was  not able to hold my line in the corners, which meant I could not go on  the attack. The final third of each race was better – that was the  best section of the race for me. We must now find out why we have  these difficulties with the full tank. I will also see what I can do  differently as a rider, to ensure that I get the BMW moving better. On  the whole, it was another tough weekend for us. We will now analyse  everything and I will take a close look to see what I, personally, can  do better. Hopefully things will go our way at the next race weekend  at Barcelona.” \n"}

Welcome home, Jeff Koons!”  said Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management, BMW AG.Adrian van Hooydonk, Head of BMW Group Design: “In  2021, we celebrate 50 years of cultural engagement worldwide. We just  love the arts and the bold voices of our time. Our passion is emotion  and to be able to work closely with Jeff Koons again has been an  extraordinary source of inspiration. What better artist to collaborate  with on the 8 Series Gran Coupe? Car Design takes inspiration from Art  and Engineering and turns that into highly emotional experiences.  Working with  Jeff Koons again to jointly create something truly  special is a great pleasure. He is one of the greatest artists of our  time and one of the most inspiring and engaging human beings to work with.”Currently the cars are being produced in secret at the BMW Group  Plant Dingolfing, Bavaria. During an exclusive evening event at  Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich’s major museum of contemporary art and  a few days prior to the opening of the IAA MOBILITY 2021, Jeff Koons  and Oliver Zipse revealed first glimpses and close-up details of the  artist’s 8 Series Gran Coupe.THE 8 X JEFF KOONS is the embodiment of precision,  refinement and craftmenship, with a multi-layer paint taking 285 hours  to apply onto each car. The expressive and striking design combines  eleven different exterior colors ranging from blue to silver as well  as from yellow to black. Only two cars will be produced each week. The  multi-colored interior is comprised of high-end materials, fine  leather and a cupholder lid with an edition badging and the artist’s  engraved signature. The seats are made up of the striking red and blue  colors of the company’s high-performance unit BMW M. Overall, the  energetic and powerful design includes both elements of pop art as  well as geometric patterns paying homage to the sporty 8 Series Gran  Coupe’s intricate contours and shape.The BMW 850i was the first model of the 8 Series launched in 1990 and  was celebrated as creating a new perspective of progress in advanced  motoring, appealing to the connoisseur who acknowledges elegance and  performance as the ultimate blend of perfection. In February 2022, BMW  will present the special edition by Jeff Koons. On the occasion of the  announcement in Munich, the artist’s very own Art Car as well as those  by Alexander Calder, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert  Rauschenberg, John Baldessari and Esther Mahlangu are on display at  the Pinakothek der Moderne, showcasing the great legacy of BMW’s  worldwide commitment to the arts for half a century.For further questions please contact:Prof. Dr  Thomas Girst BMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Head of Cultural EngagementTelephone: +49 89 382  24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comDoris FleischerBMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Cultural EngagementTelephone: +49 89 328 27806Email:    Doris.Fleischer@bmw.dewww.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.de\n"}

The FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK)    is at Magny-Cours (FRA) this weekend for round eight of the 2021    season. In Superpole on Saturday morning, Tom Sykes (GBR) from the    BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished third to secure another place on    the front row of the grid on his BMW M 1000 RR. In the afternoon’s    opening race, his team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) finished    fifth, while Sykes crossed the finish line in ninth place. Jonas    Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing Team came home 16th. Sykes was once again one of the top riders in Superpole qualifying.  The Brit briefly topped the timings, and eventually secured third  place and a spot on the front row of the grid with a time of 1:35.919  minutes. Van der Mark, who was unable to take to the track in the  morning’s third free practice session due to a technical issue  qualified ninth. Folger was 19th in qualifying. The air temperature rose to 26 degrees Celsius for the start of the  race in the afternoon, resulting in a track temperature of 40 degrees  Celsius. Starting third, Sykes dropped several positions at the start,  while van der Mark climbed into sixth place before falling back to  ninth again. On lap three, Sykes went very wide in turn five and  slotted back into the field in twelfth place. Meanwhile, van der Mark  had improved to seventh and soon took sixth place. The Dutchman  remained in that position until lap 17 of 21, when Alex Lowes (GBR \/  Kawasaki) crashed in front of him, handing van der Mark fifth place –  a position he retained through to the finish. Sykes was involved in a  number of battles throughout the whole race in a fiercely-competitive  group of riders. After 21 laps of racing, he crossed the finish line  ninth. Folger initially dropped back at the start, but made some  progress through the field in the second half of the race to finish 16th. Quotes after race one at Magny-Cours. Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Tom did a great job in Superpole, and we know he can do  that. His lap wasn’t a clean lap either so he was a bit disappointed  not to get pole, but happy with a front row start. Tom’s race was bit  disappointing for him; he had the pace to be with Michael, but he was  getting beaten up and pushed about a bit which disrupted his rhythm,  so he is not happy with ninth position. Mickey had a really difficult  day. We had a technical issue this morning and lost a lot of time  which was valuable for us. So, to qualify in P9 was not so bad for him  considering he’s not mastered qualifying on the BMW M 1000 RR yet. But  typical Michael van der Mark, he grits his teeth, he gets his head  down and battles his way and gets stronger and stronger as the race  goes on which will do his confidence the world of good. So, we can put  today behind us and focus on tomorrow and hopefully have a clean warm  up and go into the Superpole race and race two strong.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I  think if you look at the result it isn’t that bad, but it’s a shame I  lost so much time in this morning’s session. In the races, I had a  good feeling with the bike and we wanted to try something different in  FP3, but we couldn’t do so. So now in the race I am struggling a  little bit and unsure whether yesterday’s setting was better or not.  But anyway, I am happy with the points, and I am looking forward to  tomorrow’s two races.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was  another good Superpole but I am disappointed with the race today, and  disappointed at not being able to race with the other bikes. Riding in  the group, we struggled with the engine temperature and braking  performance all through the race unfortunately. We were quicker in the  turns but couldn’t get close on the straights to make a pass on the  brakes. So, it was a frustrating race but we will have to have another  go tomorrow.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “After the really  promising practice sessions, the race was really tough. I am finding  it pretty difficult to get up to speed. With a full tank I had  problems overtaking. It took a long time to pass one or two other  riders. As soon as I was able to ride in my own style later in the  race, things were much better. I hope we can find something for Sunday.” \n"}
{"prompt":" New 2 Series Coupé will be produced exclusively in Mexico for the global market.  Additional investment of USD$125 million dollars at San Luis Potosí Plant.  ->","completion":" New 2 Series Coupé will be produced exclusively in Mexico for the  global market.  Additional investment of USD$125 million dollars at  San Luis Potosí Plant.  San Luis Potosi, Mexico- The BMW Group Plant in San  Luis Potosi started the production of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé. The  new high-powered sports compact is the brand's first launch fully  executed and put into operation in Mexico.The San Luis Potosi Plant is the newest within the company's global  production network. From its design and construction, the Plant was  designed to easily adapt to produce different models. In just two  years since the Plant began production, it has enhanced operations to  include the manufacture of Plug-In Hybrid Electric vehicle and to  expand distribution to cover the globe. With an additional investment  of $125 million dollars, the facilities were improved to incorporate  this second vehicle into its production line.Harald Gottsche, President and CEO of BMW Group Plant San Luis Potosi  commented: “Two years after starting operations, our Plant integrates  a new model to its production line. This has been possible thanks to  the great talent of the team in San Luis Potosi. We are proud to be  able to exclusively assemble this vehicle in Mexico for the worldwide  market. With the new 2 Series Coupé we will show the enormous capacity  existing in this country. I am convinced that this will be the first  of many other successful launches”.Milan Nedeljkovic, member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,  responsible for production, said: “The BMW Group Plant in San Luis  Potosi builds on the experience and best practices of the Global  Production Network. As the latest addition to the network, it benefits  from the latest innovative and highly efficient technologies, which  have also contributed to it becoming one of the company's most  sustainable production sites. Thanks to its flexible production system  and its highly qualified team, we can take Premium vehicles from  Mexico to the whole world”. Born in Mexico for the global market The new BMW 2 Series Coupé is a vehicle focused on dynamic  excellence. Its athletic and sophisticated line was conceived by Jose  Casas, a Mexican who is today a senior exterior designer for the BMW  Group in Munich.Once the design stage was completed, the BMW Group Development  division in Germany jointly collaborated with Production Planning in  San Luis Potosi to prepare the new model for the launch in Mexico.The Purchasing division also played a fundamental role from the  beginning of the project in the selection, development and  industrialization of local, regional, and global suppliers.Direct investment and adaptations to the plantPart of the additional investment was allocated to the expansion of  the existing facilities and the acquisition of additional equipment  necessary to assemble the new model. This included the installation of  a total of 82 new robots in the Body Shop, while the existing robots  required new programming to be able to handle parts with different  geometries, and to weld, rivet and bolt them together to combine an  intelligent mix of materials (steel, high strength steel and aluminum)  resulting in a light, yet highly rigid body that delivers the safety,  driving dynamics and efficiency that the brand's customers expect.Together with the Materials Analysis team, the Paint Shop was  involved in the launch of two new specific colors for the BMW 2 Series  Coupé; Brooklyn Gray and Thundernight Metallic. The latter is a new  BMW Group color, exclusively for the Plant in San Luis Potosi.Finally, a part of the investment was used to train personnel of the  assembly area to work with a shorter body, with only two doors, which  requires another approach to those already existing in the production line.The company has announced that the commercialization of this model is  scheduled for later this year in North America and early 2022 in Europe. \n"}
{"prompt":"In-Car app provides intelligent combinations of different means of transport based on geo-fencing technology for navigation.  After single login, the application is installed in the vehicle via an over-the-air upgrade.  ->","completion":" Munich. Urban mobility is an important future topic  for every automobile manufacturer. By 2030, more than 80% of all  people will live in cities. Ensuring mobility is a high priority for  the BMW Group. However, mobility in urban areas can only succeed by  combining all mobility options. The BMW Group is therefore constantly  developing new solutions for optimising mobility within cities and in  the regions. It is important that individual mobility with your own  car can be combined with other mobility options. For the IAA, the BMW Group ensures that visitors will arrive at their  destination in their BMW safely and without traffic jams and also  avoid unnecessary inner-city traffic. The engineers of the BMW Group  have designed an “Intermodal Companion @ IAA MOBILITY” – an In-Car app  that offers visitors to the IAA various options, depending on their  route and destination. This vehicle app uses geo-fencing technology,  which already ensures that hybrid vehicles of the BMW Group drive  fully electrically in more than 80 European cities. BMW customers can register prior to the IAA with their ConnectedDrive  account via the website companion.bmw.de for the “Intermodal Companion  @ IAA MOBILITY”. It is then uploaded to their vehicle before the IAA  by an over-the-air upgrade process. Depending on their direction of arrival and IAA destination, users of  the In-Car app can select various BMW multi-storey car parks and  park&ride car parks in the city of Munich as parking and transfer  points. From there, they can easily reach their destination at the  trade fair or the Open Space. If intermodal arrival by public  transport is selected, users are automatically directed via the In-Car  app to one of the transfer points, where they can simply book a ticket  for the MVV (Munich public transport system) using a QR code. In the future, multimodal apps and connections to other mobility  providers will ensure that mobility for BMW customers in urban  environments is as smooth and uncomplicated as possible. Vehicle requirements:  Link to “BMW Intermodal Companion @ IAA MOBILITY” registrationpage:companion.bmw.de\n"}
{"prompt":" The BMW Group takes the opportunity of the IAA Mobility 2021 in its home city of Munich to convey visionary messages about sustainability and the circular economy Light show as part of a programme of public events in the Bavarian capital  Symbol of dialogue with society – both locally in Munich and digitally around the world   ->","completion":" Munich. Tonight a spectacular light show will light  up the façade of the BMW Group headquarters in Munich on the occasion  of the IAA Mobility 2021. Four different animations addressing the  transition to future mobility will be projected on the world-famous  architectural icon that is shaped like a four-cylinder engine. The BMW  Group’s current messages will be conveyed by the 99-metre-high  building in the form of powerfully expressive, brightly coloured  animated sequences. Head of BMW Brand Communication and Experience,  Stefan Ponikva, emphasises the particular significance of the BMW  Tower and the importance of this campaign: “The Four-Cylinder is the  architectural icon of the BMW Group and a distinctive landmark in the  city of Munich. We’re keen to send out a powerful signal to the world  in support of a sustainable vision for a circular economy.”“The BMW Group continues to reduce its CO2 emissions and  is consistently expanding the circular economy: technological  advancements and innovative drive will enable us to tackle today’s  challenges together. That’s our unequivocal mission. And we intend to  demonstrate it at the IAA Mobility 2021,” says Alexander Bilgeri, Head  of Strategy, Services, Media House, Market Communications Europe,  China at BMW.Cycle of four animations focuses on the BMW Group’s circular economyThe various sequences on the cylinder-shaped façade visualise the BMW  Group’s approaches to CO2 reduction, climate neutrality and  the circular economy over the entire lifecycle of an automobile. From  low-impact extraction of raw materials and energy-efficient production  through to maximum efficiency during the customer use phase and  recycling at the end of the product’s lifetime.A sequence of different projections illustrates this cycle,  showcasing the circular economy – the BMW Group’s guiding theme at the  IAA 2021 – as well as the company’s accomplishments to date in the  electrification of its vehicles and the use of innovations such as  those in the area of digitalisation. One of the animations visualises  the transition from the combustion engine to electric mobility:  starting with the virtual up-and-down movement of pistons to portray  the combustion process in the cylinders, this then transforms into  colourful pulsating battery cells, finally announcing the status  “Fully Charged”. Another sequence is dedicated to the circular  economy. At the beginning of this animation, the building shell of the  Four-Cylinder Tower appears to melt, after which the inside of the  cylinders fills with liquid metal. From a vortex, the silhouette  gradually emerges of the “BMW i Vision Circular” – the study vehicle  being premiered at the IAA that symbolises the BMW Group’s extensive  expertise in the circular economy. The following words appear at the  end of this sequence: “WELCOME TO IAA. LET'S RE:IMAGINE TODAY.”Film music creator and Academy Award winner Hans Zimmer provides the  musical background for the light show; the sound collaboration was  realised by Remote Control Productions, one of Zimmer's companies.Over 16 million pixels from 36 projectors make the Tower light upThe premiere of the light show for the IAA will start tonight at 9:30  pm and further projections are planned for the days to come. Involving  36 projectors with over 16 million pixels, the show consists of the  four animations being projected in succession on three sides of the  building’s façade. The complete series of four illuminations lasts  about four and a half minutes. The show then starts again, finally  ending for the day at 11 pm. Visitors have a particularly impressive  view of this unique illumination from BMW Welt and the BMW Museum. For  the duration of the IAA Mobility 2021, other public events relating to  the mobility of the future will be held at these and other locations  around the BMW headquarters and also in the city centre of Munich.  With its new “Open Space” event concept, the IAA leaves the exhibition  halls for the first time to engage in discussion with citizens on the  subject of future mobility. One example of this is the BMW Circular  Lab, where visitors can discover the future of sustainable mobility  under the motto “RE:THINK, RE:USE, RE:DUCE and RE:CYCLE”. The BMW  Group’s entire trade fair presence at the IAA Mobility 2021 is based  on the guiding theme of sustainability. But nowhere is this message  brought to life more vividly than on the brightly lit BMW  Four-Cylinder towering into Munich night sky.\n"}

{"prompt":" Munich trade fair becomes the heart of BMW co-creation with a worldwide network of personalities from various sectors of society  Collaboration as the key to authentic social media storytelling – especially for a young audience  Long-term and trusting partnerships, both in the past and for the future   ->","completion":" Munich. BMW is setting new standards in co-creation  communication at the IAA Mobility 2021. At the trade fair, the brand  brings together a global network of ambassadors with a total range of  more than 100 million followers to collaborate on creative content and  ideas. “The automotive industry is currently engaged in a global  transformation. BMW itself is undergoing a process of rejuvenation and  finding new forms of communication. Partnership with BMW co-creators  supports this change,” explains Stefan Ponikva, Head of Brand  Communication and Experience.For BMW, the IAA Mobility 2021 is all about electromobility and the  circular economy. BMW has become a driver of innovation in both these  areas and is seeking to engage in debate on these subjects with  existing target groups as well as new ones. Getting young people  excited about the mobility of tomorrow is very important to BMW. One  promising way to achieve this is through co-creation. Credible  collaborations between the brand and its ambassadors are key to  authentic storytelling. Co-creation builds on long-term and trusting  cooperation with personalities and opinion leaders from various  sectors of society such as art, music, fashion, lifestyle,  sustainability and technology.BMW has already been very successful in the past with this approach,  and it is something that has been boosted by the pandemic: as part of  the #NextGen campaign 2020, BMW generated over 300 million impressions  on social media through strategic collaborations. Highlights include  the co-creation with Dude with Sign on the sustainable BMW i series, a  virtual MINI Vision Car for a virtual influencer, a YouTube talk show  with Alex Hirschi aka Supercar Blondie and a 3D print premiere of the  BMW iX.Creative content and high-reach social media activities are    being developed for the IAA Mobility 2021 in collaboration with    opinion leadersAt the IAA Mobility 2021, BMW turns its attention even more to the  needs and preferences of a digital audience. The co-creators provide a  plausible presentation to their digital target groups of what the  circular economy is all about and how BMW is making use of it to  become even more sustainable. Co-creation involves partnership with  BMW on an equal footing, whereby the ambassadors themselves take the  lead in (co-)producing the content: “We actively involve them in the  design of communication so as to open up new perspectives not only for  the BMW brand, but also for our partners and their audience. In this  way, we’re establishing BMW as a relationship brand and expanding  co-creation as a strategic component of BMW brand management,” says  Stefan Ponikva.A good example of creative collaboration is the cooperation with  sustainability ambassador and journalist Gemma Styles. She will be  discussing the urgency of sustainable innovations and technologies  with BMW CEO Oliver Zipse at the presentation of the “BMW iVision  Circular”. “I really enjoyed working with BMW on such an important and  challenging issue. BMW was totally open to co-creation and feedback.  It’s great to see a major brand showing authentic interest in a more  sustainable future – and I learned a lot, too.” The meeting in Munich  will also be used by some of the opinion leaders involved for the  exclusive production of social media content featuring the two BMW  electrically powered vehicles BMW iX and BMW i4 as well as the digital  IAA experience of BMW JOYTOPIA.The international co-creator community includes other well-known  personalities such as Academy Award winner Hans Zimmer, music producer  Steve Aoki and Brooklyn Beckham. Commenting on his collaboration with  BMW, the British photographer and Gen Z advocate says: “The years I’ve  spent with BMW have been a wonderful partnership. With its  forward-thinking design and innovative ideas, BMW embodies exactly  what it means to be an automobile brand. As a BMW global partner and  co-creator, I really enjoy sharing the brand’s stories through my own  eyes.” The co-creators also include highly acclaimed newcomers such as  singer Zoe Wees, skateboarder Nyjah Huston, actor Luka Sabbat, Alex  Hirschi – also known as Supercar Blondie, longstanding brand  ambassador Lena Gercke and well-known TikToker Younes Zarou.\n"}

{"prompt":" BMW iX first premium vehicle with 5G  Deutsche Telekom introduces the first mobile phone contract for a Personal eSIM in the car   ->","completion":" Munich \/ Bonn. With the BMW iX, the BMW Group is the  first premium manufacturer to integrate the 5G mobile radio standard  into a globally available production vehicle and Deutsch Telekom is  offering the first corresponding 5G connectivity for such a vehicle.  The Personal eSIM can be easily extended and activated via an existing  contract with the MobilityConnect option. This makes the vehicle  another interconnected device for customers, like a smartwatch. They  benefit from the high bandwidth and low latency of 5G. The vehicle  provides significantly improved telephone quality* and enables a 5G  WLAN hotspot* for up to ten devices in the vehicle. The activated  Personal eSIM is linked directly to the BMW ID of the customer. It can  be used in any enabled vehicle including the corresponding functions.Mobility is entering the 5G era for the first  time.The new 5G mobile radio standard will  significantly increase the data transmission options compared to the  previous standard. This will create new, data-based applications and  increase the quality of existing applications many times over. For  mobility, this means a comprehensive extension of data-based services  in the fields of entertainment and infotainment, automated and  assisted driving and, above all, road safety. The 5G standard is a  decisive accelerator for future innovations in mobility and other  fields of application.Deutsche Telekom and the BMW Group use Personal eSIM and  MobilityConnect to connect the vehicle to the customer’s mobile radio  based on 5G for the first time. In addition, Telekom customers can  extend their existing mobile phone contract to their car for the first time. Personal eSIM, real ‘Dual-SIM-Dual-Active’ and WLAN  hotspotThe BMW iX is the technology flagship of the BMW  Group and represents a real world first in networking. 5G and eSIM are  being used in a production vehicle here for the first time.In  addition to the standard integrated vehicle eSIM, an additional  Personal eSIM will be integrated, as previously familiar from smart  devices such as tablets or smartwatches. The mobile phone technology  installed in the vehicle enables both eSIMs to be active with 5G  simultaneously with the full range of services (Dual-SIM-Dual-Active).  The BMW iX multi-aerial system, specially developed for 5G, routes the  radio signal from the performance-optimised multi-band aerials  directly to the vehicle's infotainment system via a Gigabit Ethernet  connection. In future, all passengers will benefit from the improved  connection quality and increased data throughput, because a WLAN  hotspot* can be activated in the vehicle via the Personal eSIM,  allowing up to ten end devices to surf or stream at 5G speed. At the  same time, it is no longer necessary to book an additional separate  mobile phone contract for the vehicle for a hotspot. The vehicle's  eSIM can be easily activated with the MobilityConnect option via the  existing mobile phone contract of the Telekom customer.“BMW has always been a pioneer in the networking of mobility. We  already installed the first SIM card in a vehicle back in 1997. With  the 5G Personal eSIM, we are now integrating a completely new level of  connectivity for our customers in the car in cooperation with Deutsche  Telekom.” says Stephan Durach, Senior Vice President of Connected  Company Development and Operations BMW GroupTelekom introduces the first 5G mobile radio option for the  carFor the first time, Telekom is introducing a special  rate option for integrated connectivity in the vehicle. When the BMW  iX is available on the market Telekom customers can extend their  mobile phone contract with the MobilityConnect option to include the  BMW iX and later other enabled models for 9.95 euros per month.“Telekom is the leading network provider in Germany - both in mobile  radio and in the landline network. With our new MobilityConnect mobile  radio option, we are bringing 5G networking into a vehicle as standard  for the first time. Our best 5G network makes premium connectivity  possible like in the BMW iX. We thus create completely new  applications for Telekom customers in the fields of entertainment and  infotainment and enable the increasing networking of the car”,  explains André Almeida, Managing Director Private Customers Telekom Germany.Simple booking via appThe booking can be easily  started in the vehicle and the customer is guided step-by-step by the  My BMW App or Telekom customer centre to the conclusion of the  contract. When you book the rate option, the eSIM is activated for the  vehicle. After a minimum term of one year, the rate option can then be  cancelled on a daily basis. Families can thus e.g. book the digital  services at short notice for the next holiday trip by car. It should  be possible to book the mobile phone option for the car for other  vehicle models as early as this year.Personal eSIM can be transferred to other enabled  vehiclesOnce the Personal eSIM has been activated using  the MobilityConnect option, the personal driver settings are not only  stored in the car, but also with the BMW ID. Customers can thus  transfer the settings of the Personal eSIM to other enabled vehicles  by activating the BMW ID. Activation of the Personal eSIM in the car  is carried out automatically with login with the BMW ID and is  immediately available.

{"prompt":" BMW iX first premium vehicle with 5G  Vodafone introduces the first mobile phone contract for a Personal eSIM in the car   ->","completion":" Munich \/ Düsseldorf. With the BMW iX, the BMW Group  is the first premium manufacturer to integrate the 5G mobile radio  standard into a globally available production vehicle and Vodafone is  offering the first 5G mobile radio contract for such a vehicle.  An existing multi-SIM contract can be extended with the Vodafone  One Number Car option to activate the Personal eSIM in the vehicle.  This makes the vehicle another interconnected device for customers,  like a smartwatch. In addition to the high bandwidth and low latency  of 5G, they also benefit from significantly improved telephone  quality* by the use of four external aerials and a 5G WiFi hotspot*  for up to ten devices in the vehicle. The activated Personal eSIM is  linked directly to the customer's BMW ID and can be smoothly  transferred to other eSIM-capable vehicles, including the  corresponding functions.Mobility is entering the 5G era for the first  time.The new 5G mobile radio standard will  significantly increase the data transmission options compared to the  previous standard. This will create new, data-based applications and  increase the quality of existing applications many times over. For  mobility, this means a comprehensive extension of data-based services  in the fields of entertainment and infotainment, automated and  assisted driving and, above all, road safety. The 5G standard is a  decisive accelerator for future innovations in mobility and other  fields of application.Vodafone and the BMW Group use Personal eSIM and Vodafone One Number  Car to connect the vehicle and the customer with mobile radio based on  5G for the first time. The vehicle becomes an integrated part of the  networked ecosystem of the customer.Personal eSIM, real ‘Dual-SIM-Dual-Active’ and WLAN  hotspotThe BMW iX is the technology flagship of the BMW  Group and represents a real world first in networking. 5G and eSIM are  being used in a production vehicle here for the first time.In  addition to the standard integrated vehicle eSIM, an additional  Personal eSIM will be integrated, as previously familiar from smart  devices such as tablets or smartwatches. The mobile phone technology  installed in the vehicle enables both eSIMs to be active with 5G  simultaneously with the full range of services (Dual-SIM-Dual-Active).  The BMW iX multi-aerial system, specially developed for 5G, routes the  radio signal from the performance-optimised multi-band aerials  directly to the vehicle's infotainment system via a Gigabit Ethernet  connection. In future, all passengers will benefit from the improved  connection quality and increased data throughput, because a WLAN  hotspot* can be activated in the vehicle via the Personal eSIM,  allowing up to ten end devices to surf or stream at 5G speed. At the  same time, it is no longer necessary to book an additional service or  a separate mobile phone rate for the vehicle for a hotspot.“BMW has always been a pioneer in the networking of mobility. We  already installed the first SIM card in a vehicle back in 1997. With  the 5G Personal eSIM, we are now integrating a completely new level of  connectivity for our customers in the car in cooperation with  Vodafone.” says Stephan Durach, Senior Vice President of Connected  Company Development and Operations BMW GroupVodafone introduces the first 5G mobile radio contract for  cars.Vodafone is introducing the first smartphone rate  for the car. To be able to use all benefits such as a 5G-optimised  connection, improved connection quality and the use of digital  services with a high-speed connection in the car, no additional  contract needs to be concluded. When the BMW iX is available on the  market, Vodafone customers can extend their mobile phone contract with  the Vodafone One Number Car option to include the BMW iX and later  other enabled BMW models for only 5 euros per month.“Together with BMW, we are bringing the first Vodafone 5G in a car on  the road. The multi-aerial system integrates fast network and digital  services even better into the vehicle. For the customer in the car,  this means even higher mobile phone quality, fewer annoying phone call  interruptions and more digital variety to make even better use of the  driving time,\" says Michael Reinartz, Head of Innovations at  Vodafone Germany.The booking can be easily started in the vehicle and the customer is  guided step-by-step by the My BMW App or the My Vodafone App to the  conclusion of the contract. When you book the rate option, the eSIM is  activated for the vehicle for a one-time fee of 10 euros. After that,  Vodafone One Number Car costs € 5 a month. There is no permanent  commitment for the customer. The rate option can be cancelled on a  monthly basis. Families can thus e.g. book the digital services at  short notice for the next holiday trip by car. The mobile phone rate  for cars will also be available in other BMW models next year. In  addition to the BMW iX, the BMW i4 will also be 5G capable and have  the Personal eSIM functions.Personal eSIM can be transferred to other enabled  vehiclesOnce the Personal eSIM has been activated via  Vodafone with the Vodafone One Number Car rate, the data is not only  stored in the vehicle, but also with the BMW ID.

{"prompt":" Measures to achieve 1.5-degree goal: BMW Group backs sustainable, innovative materials and circular economy  Higher recycling rates and material substitutions for faster reduction of lifecycle CO2 emissions by 2030  Innovative materials research and collaborations key factors in combating climate change ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is stepping up its fight  against climate change with a unique sustainability strategy and  clearly defined CO2 targets, as announced by Oliver Zipse,  Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG at a media event in Munich.The main focus of the company’s pioneering strategy is, on the one  hand, to drastically reduce CO2 per vehicle by  2030. On the other, with the introduction of the “Neue  Klasse”, the BMW Group will be massively promoting the use of    secondary material and the forward-looking  principles of the circular economy. The BMW Group is  committing to a more sustainable pathway, with the goal of limiting  global warming to 1.5 degrees C.Fulfilment of all climate goals is closely tied to research    and development of sustainable materials. The BMW Group  believes only a holistic approach to the use of proven and new  materials can permanently reduce CO2 emissions. For this  reason, the BMW Group is focusing its research and development efforts  on environmentally-compatible raw materials. At the same time, it is  accelerating targeted the creation of a secondary-materials market and  working with select startups and experienced material suppliers to  develop pioneering materials.“We are setting new standards forsustainable premium quality – by rethinking materials  and focusing more than ever on resource-efficient alternatives and  renewable materials with strong dismantling capability,” said Dr  Stefan Floeck, head of Development Body, Exterior, Interior,  responsible for Product Line MINI, Compact Class BMW since 1  September. “We are following a consistent path towards holistically  sustainable product development, responsible use of resources and  transformation into a circular economy.”Innovative materials for a sustainable goalFor  both the interior and exterior, the use of intelligent, sustainable  materials forms the basis for resource-efficient car-building. The BMW  Group has defined material groups with sustainable properties that set  new standards and span all four dimensions of the circular economy:  RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE and RE:CYCLE.Integrating natural raw materialsThe BMW Group  has used renewable raw materials in its vehicles for a number of years  now – for example, in door trim panels, where a natural-fibre mat is  paired with a plastic matrix to provide the necessary stability.    Renewable raw materials like natural fibres are not  only 30 percent lighter than plastic alternatives,  they also come into the CO2 calculation with a    negative value, since they absorb CO2 and  release oxygen during the growth phase.In recognition of this potential, the BMW Group and its partners have  systematically further developed the use of fibres such as hemp, kenaf  and flax, providing them with natural fibre lattice structures. Thanks  to these support structures, it is possible to maintain their  mechanical properties and avoid additional weight by reducing the  amount of material needed.Wood can be used as a renewable raw material in many different areas  of application. The BMW Group is also conducting research into    pioneering wood foams with an open-pored structure made up  of finely ground wood particles. The foams’ resistance comes from the  wood’s own binding forces, which make it possible to dispense with  synthetic adhesives. The foams therefore consist of 100-percent  renewable raw materials and could replace acoustic foams in the future. Recycled plastics: smart and environmentally-friendly  The BMW Group already uses up to 100-percent recycled  plastic in its thermoplastic components and is working with pioneering  plastic manufacturers to further develop recycled plastics and bioplastics with a significantly lower carbon  footprint. In addition to recycled plastics, the company also employs  biobased plastics and plastics reinforced with natural fibres such as  cellulose, hemp, wood or bamboo to reduce the percentage of    oil-based primary plastics. The aim is to use  thermoplastics with an average of 40 percent recycled material by 2030.Innovative leather from new sourcesNew vegan  and resource-efficient leather alternatives are another important  element of the BMW Group’s research. Synthetic leather with biobased  raw materials, 100-percent recycled polyester textiles and cork  particles enable CO2 emissions to be reduced by up    to 45 percent compared to today's PVC synthetic leather. In  cooperation with the startup Adriano di Marti S.A. de C.V., the BMW  Group is researching a sustainable cactus-based material.  DeserttexTM is made from pulverised cactus fibres  with a biobased polyurethane matrix. Another promising alternative to  leather is the fully recyclable MirumTM,  which mimics all the properties of traditional leather, yarns and  foams. The BMW Group’s equity investment in the startup Natural Fiber  Welding opens up new possibilities for developing and implementing  plant-based material options.Textiles – reimagined and 100-percent  recyclableAs part of its research and development  activities, the BMW Group is working on innovative materials with the  potential for use in future vehicles. These include synthetic    textile variants, which are mostly used for seat covers.  They have a low carbon footprint and can be manufactured from    100-percent recycled material. Thanks to their  composition, they can repeatedly be fed back into the cycle    and reused several times over the course of their product  lifecycle. The BMW Group aims to use more  mono-materials, instead of multi-layered,  multi-material approaches. In seats, for instance, the cover and the  foam beneath it are currently made of different materials. These can  neither be easily separated out nor recycled together to create a new  material that can be used in vehicles. The various connecting elements  between the materials, such as adhesives and yarn, also play a role in  this. If both parts are made of the same material, it is possible for  them to be recycled within the circular economy. The BMW Group is also  employing new techniques to give textiles a new appearance, using 3D  structures, applications, templates and graphic elements, and working  on a new material mix for series introduction.With these and many other innovative measures, the BMW Group seeks to  raise general awareness of sustainable materials and provide a  transparent insight into its circular approach to a sustainable future  – with the aim of reducing lifecycle CO2 emissions    by more than 40 percent by 2030.\n"}
{"prompt":"BMW 320 Group 5 “Junior Team” to compete alongside Marc Surer (CH) at the DRM Revival at the Red Bull Ring during the supporting programme of the DTM.  ->","completion":" Munich\/Spielberg. BMW Group Classic will compete with  a BMW 320 Group 5 in the “DRM Revival” at the Red Bull Ring in  Spielberg being held by DTM Classic from 3 – 5 September 2021. It was  possible to gain Marc Surer (CH) as the driver who will race the  vehicle with the classic “BMW Junior Team” design of 1977.Marc Surer was a member of the “BMW Junior Team”, which was  established at that time, and can hardly wait to step on the gas in  Spielberg: “Some 44 years after starting with the BMW 320 Group 5 as a  member of the BMW Junior Team in Zolder, it is a very special  experience for me to be amongst the competitors at the DRM Revival.”He will be accompanied by the current BMW Juniors Dan Harper, Max  Hesse and Neil Verhagen. The initiator of BMW Junior Team of 1977,  Jochen Neerpasch, does not intend to miss the spectacle and will also  be attending the event.For Norbert Knerr, racing manager of BMW Group Classic, the line-up  is historic bridge building: “We couldn’t have found a better  framework to deploy the BMW 320 Group 5. To see Marc Surer at the  wheel of his 1977 vehicle at the DRM Revival in Spielberg, accompanied  by the current BMW juniors and Jochen Neerpasch, is definitely an  occasion that couldn’t be more fitting and emotional.”The “DRM Revival” organised by DTM Classic will take place during the  DTM Racing Weekend at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg\/Austria, being  held from 3 to 5 September. The historic vehicles of the Divisions 1  and 2 will, in addition to training and qualifying events, also  compete in two races.\n"}
{"prompt":"A breath of fresh air for urban electric mobility on two wheels. ->","completion":" Munich. With the Concept CE 02, BMW Motorrad is  presenting a new interpretation of smart, urban single-track mobility  one week before the IAA Mobility 2021. The electric vehicle concept,  which is neither a classic motorcycle nor a scooter, is an exciting  and highly emotional mobility offer.“At first glance, there is little about the BMW Motorrad Concept  CE 02 that is typically BMW Motorrad – it’s something completely new.  We want to strive for something novel and be pioneers – which is what  we’ve proven ourselves capable of with various projects in the past.  The Concept CE 02 features new proportions and modern forms of  single-track mobility in an urban environment. In addition, we wanted  to achieve a level of design innovation that we have not had before at  this level. Straightforward use was important, but above all the  emotional component was crucial, as well as riding fun,” explains  Edgar Heinrich, Head of Design BMW Motorrad.With its compact dimensions and youthful proportions, it also  clearly appeals to a new target group: people aged 16 and over, who  have not ridden a motorbike before but are open to new experiences,  smart technology and, above all, combining mobility with fun. As a  lightweight e-vehicle weighing about 120 kg, the BMW Motorrad Concept  CE 02 is ideal for urban use, offering a high fun factor as well as  straightforward yet stylish commuting. The 11 kW of output and all the  torque available from standstill allow for fast acceleration at  traffic lights. A top speed of 90 km\/h and a range of 90 km make it  easy to get from A to B – and back again – even in heavy city traffic.The design expresses a new facet of BMW Motorrad.The overall look of the two-wheeler reveals the novel character of  the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 at first glance. “We wanted to develop  an easily accessible two-wheeler for everyone who wants to be  mobile and independent,” says Alexander Buckan, Head of Vehicle Design  BMW Motorrad. “The BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 is a reliable companion  on a day-to-day basis. You love it because it’s always there for you  and it just works – even if you occasionally don't treat it as  carefully as you might. And there are stickers, tapes and other forms  of customisation that make it quite clear to everyone that it belongs  to you. It embodies youthful freedom and a carefree spirit – rather  like a skateboard on two wheels.”The simple and transparent proportions ensure an honest,  emotional aesthetic appeal. Two large-size wheels, similar to a fun  bike, promise robustness and straightforward riding fun. They are  designed as disc wheels, thereby emphasising the proportions of the  vehicle graphically. The dark area for the two battery units and the  drive with silver accentuations create a compact body. The long,  narrow seat and the frame round off the distinctive silhouette.A new introduction to BMW Motorrad. Thanks to the flat vehicle body, the centre of gravity is low and  favourable when it comes to riding dynamics. At the same time, the BMW  Motorrad Concept CE 02 looks inviting and confidence-inspiring thanks  to the large disc wheels and low seat height. Characteristic  proportions not only allow for a very agile riding experience, they  are also intended to encourage non-motorcyclists to perhaps get on and  have a go.The continuous seat reflects the versatility of the concept.  Whether leaning far back with your feet first or leaning forward with  your feet on the rear footrests or, of course, with two people – the  seat allows numerous sitting positions since no foot brake lever has  to be operated due to the electric drive. In addition, the free space  between the seat and frame offers room for small luggage items. In the  front area of the seat, there are two crossed-over petrol-coloured  elastic bands attached in such a way as to enable smaller items to be  casually tucked in. Further storage space is provided by the brackets:  the front footrests are mounted here, too. You can also attach your  own skateboard here and use it as a footrest.High-quality details on closer inspection. The purist design reveals high-quality details and technical  refinements on closer inspection. Light is provided by a square, black  headlight with four distinctive LED elements as front headlights. The  rear light comprises two small, translucent LED leaves that are fixed  to the left and right of the rear seat. A small colour screen on the  handlebars provides basic display functionality: this is connected via  a visible, visually deliberately overemphasised cable harness.  Otherwise, the technology is deliberately restrained. In combination  with the disc wheels and the single-sided swinging arm, the showcased  elements such as the drive belt, handlebars and fork emphasise the  urban, modern character of the concept bike in detail.The colour scheme puts the rider at the centre.In terms of colour, the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02 also keeps things  purist: black\/silver is the underlying scheme. The colour black is  reminiscent of early BMW motorbikes. What is new here, however, is the  interplay of matt and high-gloss surfaces, giving the concept bike  greater expressiveness. Silver-coloured elements such as the triple  clamp or the drive, the white graphics and the petrol-coloured luggage  straps set targeted accentuations, breaking up the overall image.  Technoid typography is used as an active design tool, conveying the  association with technical information on machines. The BMW emblem is  integrated on the whitish silicone seat just in front of the  handlebars; otherwise only the BMW wordmark on the rims and luggage  straps indicates the manufacturer.With this rather restrained colour scheme, the BMW Motorrad  Concept CE 02 provides the ideal platform for the rider to showcase  their own individual character. Additional individualisation by means  of stickers or tapes is also possible and indeed desirable.Fashion statement – urban riding gear for young male and    female riders.The innovative concept rider equipment perfectly matches the BMW  Motorrad Concept CE 02. Two jackets inspired by contemporary trends  indicate a whole range of new possibilities for both functional and  fashionable clothing with innovative materials and processing  techniques. The two variants both echo the typographic style of the  vehicle graphics. Casually styled, the jackets also underscore a  youthful fashion awareness.The playful use of transparency – revealing function as a design  element – means the product is both functional and a fashionable  everyday garment. In doing so, it is deliberately set apart from  conventional rider equipment, focusing on current fashion trends instead.Print-on protection.Both rider equipment variants feature protection as part of the  graphic statement. A newly developed technique (GRDXKN®) allows a  protection function to be printed on. This integrated, volume-forming  material is abrasion-resistant and impact-absorbing. It creates a  completely new interplay of graphics and structure in both outfits,  thereby raising function and design to the same level.The women’s jacket shows off the neon-orange colour of the print  through its slightly transparent Windstopp material, while golden  reflective graphics and colourful colour gradients create attractive  design stimuli.The 3D structure of the print comes into its own in the men's  jacket. The petrol-coloured details and the white graphics harmonise  with the colour scheme of the concept bike to round off the overall appearance.It was possible to produce and manufacture the rider equipment  almost exclusively in collaboration with regional experts and  suppliers in Germany.Figures of the BMW Motorrad Concept CE 02.Battery: not specifiedOutput: 11 kW for driving licence class from A1 (ECE)Vmodmax: up to 90 km\/hRange: approx. 90 km (according to WMTC)Wheels: disc wheels with 15-inch front and rearSeat height: 730 mmUnladen weight: approx. 120 kgYou will find press material on current BMW motorcycles and BMW  Motorrad rider equipment in the BMW Group PressClub at www.press.bmwgroup.com.The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

In our monthly BMW SIM News, we briefly summarise news from the world of virtual racing, and provide information on driver backgrounds, teams, technology, and much more.  ->","completion":" BMW SIM GT Cup.After a summer break of two and a half months, the second half of  this year's BMW SIM GT Cup season started with three races in August.  This time, the world’s best sim racers were competing at the wheel of  the virtual BMW M4 GT3, having completed the races during the first  half of the season with the BMW M8 GTE. Tuomas Tähtelä and Pekka  Tuomainen (both FIN) from the KOVA team claimed victory in the opening  race with the BMW M4 GT3 on 1st August at the Imola circuit, booking  their ticket for the year’s final at BMW SIM Live 2021. The teams in  second to fifth positions qualified for the Season 2 finale, which  gives them another chance to secure a spot at the year’s final. They  will compete against the teams crossing the line in second to fifth  positions in the other three races taking place in the second half of  the season. Teams and drivers that have already qualified from Season  1 will not be classified in these standings. Others will move up to  take their places. Two further spots have already been claimed.  Alejandro Sánchez and Cristian Lamela (both ESP) from the MSI eSports  team will both be there after triumphing in the second race in August  at the virtual Circuit of the Americas. The third race at the 'Mount  Panorama Circuit' in Bathurst was won by Maximilian Benecke (GER) and  Enzo Bonito (ITA) from Team Redline. However, as they had already  qualified for BMW SIM Live, the tickets went to their team-mates Chris  Lulham (GBR) and Patrik Holzmann (GER) in second place. One more  regular race is scheduled for 24th October at the Monza circuit. The  Season 2 finale at the Hockenheimring will take place on 14th  November. There will then be 24 drivers confirmed to race off for the  year’s title at BMW SIM Live 2021. Defending champion is Joshua Rogers  (AUS) from the Coanda Simsport team. He has already secured his return  to the finale by claiming a win in the virtual BMW M8 GTE in the first  half of the season. BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup.Just like the BMW SIM GT Cup, the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup also  kicked off the second half of this year’s season in August. The  settings for the two races held thus far were the circuits of Monza  and Sebring, where Diogo Silva (POR) from the GTC Race Center team and  Lorenz Hörzing (AUT) from the Jochen Schweizer Sim Racing Team secured  their places at BMW SIM Live 2021. Silva needed no more than a  fourth-place finish in the opening race, as the three drivers on the  podium had already claimed their tickets for the finale in the first  half of the season. The win went to Erhan Jajovski (MKD). The second  race at the virtual Sebring International Raceway was won by Michal  Smidl (CZE) ahead of Hörzing. As Smidl had already qualified, Hörzing  was also able to claim a spot. In September and October, four more  races at the circuits of Lime Rock Park, Loch Drummond,  Spa-Francorchamps and Indianapolis will provide the opportunity to be  part of the year’s finale at BMW SIM Live 2021. Jajovski will be there  as he attempts to defend the title he won last year. BMW SIM Teams at Formula Medicine.For many years, BMW Motorsport has trusted in the expertise of  Formula Medicine to ensure that the BMW works drivers can enjoy  optimal physical and mental preparation for their competitive  appearances. At the end of July, selected drivers from the BMW SIM  Team also had the chance to gain some valuable insights into the  training methodology at Formula Medicine during a workshop in  Viareggio (ITA), and to get some important ideas for their own  training schedule. The multi-day workshop included fitness and mental  coaching sessions. These were accompanied by reaction exercises and  nutritional advice. Enzo Bonito (ITA) and Kevin Siggy (SLO) were the  BMW Team Redline representatives, Arthur Kammerer and Gregor Schill  (both GER) took part for BMW Team G2 Esports, Nikodem Wisniewski (POL)  and Petar Brljak (CRO) took part for BMW Team GB and Elias Seppänen  (FIN) and Attila Dencs (HUN) represented BMW Team BS+COMPETITION. “The physical training was certainly useful for me as a sim racer, as  we are also subjected to relatively significant force feedback effects  on the arms, wrist and elbows through the steering wheel. It is  important to strengthen these areas and to do something for the knees  and stamina in general,” was Kammerer’s summary. “However, the mental  coaching was the most valuable aspect for me – and that was the most  fun part too. We had these multitasking exercises that showed me how  easy it is for unexpected events or distractions to knock me out of my  routine. I will now integrate exercises like this into my regular  training routine. Good multitasking is helpful even just to discuss  strategies during the race or to correctly calculate the amount of  fuel without losing concentration, missing the right braking or  steering points and therefore posting a poor lap time. Having the  mental capacity for both things was an important core topic of the  workshop. Overall, a perfect combination for mind and body.” \n"}
{"prompt":"Rethinking coexistence in cities: The start-up Accelerator URBAN-X, initiated by MINI, is facing urban challenges with its new video campaign and presenting innovative solutions from creative thinkers.  ->","completion":" Munich.

The program was founded by MINI in  2016. Since its launch, more than 70 start-ups from different  countries have already gone through the accelerator. A new cohort of  up to ten urbantech start-ups is assembled every six months – selected  from more than 1000 applications per year.In a creative exchange with designers, engineers and developers of  MINI, the founders of the selected start-ups are supported in the  further development of their business model. The innovations created  in this process address some of the most pressing urban challenges,  from building technology and infrastructure to mobility and energy  supply to public health and civic services. They create cities that we  can all love.“Amidst the pandemic, cities around the world are confronting issues  of equity, access and opportunity while at the same time addressing  resiliency and sustainability. With people rediscovering what they  love about their cities and new solutions to address climate change  and improve quality of life cropping up across the globe, now is the  perfect time to reimagine city life and support the innovators who aim  to do so,” said Micah Kotch, Managing Director of URBAN-X.As part of the #LTCxHTC campaign, four innovative start-ups from the  current cohort will also be presented. For example, the start-up  Circuit, which offers free rides on-demand in bustling inner cities as  an emission-free short-haul service. Circuit mediates passengers via  app, helping to reduce congestion and eliminate the need for annoying parking.The communication platform OneRoof helps people who live in the same  house to network, get to know each other and feel more supported.  Their goal is to turn a group of people who live under the same roof  into a house community.Thanks to modular, customizable bike pods, Oonee offers safe storage  for scooters and bicycles in inner-city metropolitan areas. The  easy-to-install pods facilitate sustainable urban mobility and enhance  public space through seating and roof greening.The start-up Thrilling is also part of the current URBAN-X cohort.  Founded in the United States, the company is the first e-commerce  platform to specialize in supporting small, independent vintage and  secondhand stores. By communicating these offers, customers have the  opportunity to minimize their ecological footprint when choosing their clothing.MINI also remains true to its founding idea in supporting urbantech  start-ups: to challenge the status quo and thus develop new,  sustainable mobility solutions for city dwellers. With URBAN-X, MINI  supports entrepreneurs, engineers and designers in the development of  sustainable, vibrant and sustainable cities.At the International Motor Show IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich, visitors  can find out about URBAN-X at the exhibition stand at the Summit on  the exhibition grounds as well as in the MINI Pavilion on Lenbachplatz  from 7 September to 12 September 2021 and learn more about the  promising start-up teams and their projects.

Having visited the two new circuits of Most (CZE) and    Navarra (ESP), BMW Motorrad Motorsport is returning to familiar    territory this weekend. From 3rd to 5th September, the eighth round    of the FIM Superbike World Championship 2021 will take place at    ‘Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours’ in the heart of France. The BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team and riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael der    Mark (NED) already know the circuit very well from the WorldSBK.    Jonas Folger (GER) and the Bonovo MGM Racing team, who are competing    in their first full season in the WorldSBK, have already made a    guest appearance at Magny-Cours in the French Superbike Championship FSBK. Magny-Cours lies around 250 kilometres south of Paris, the French  capital, and has been a fixture on the WorldSBK calendar for nearly 20  years. A world championship race took place there for the first time  in 1991 and WorldSBK has visited Magny-Cours each year since 2003. The  combination of fast corners with long, straight sections and tight  hairpin bends makes for a challenging track layout. Quotes ahead of the Magny-Cours round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  Magny-Cours layout has a bit of everything and is an interesting  challenge for teams and riders. We have been very competitive there  over the last two years. Tom Sykes reached the podium in 2019, while  Eugene Laverty and Tom claimed double pole in a great Superpole  qualifying in 2020. However, this year sees us visit Magny-Cours a few  weeks earlier, which could mean different conditions – it will be  warmer, even though we can probably expect some rain to make an  appearance, as usual. We have set up our BMW M 1000 RR to be ready for  all eventualities. Our aim is to give ourselves a good start position  in qualifying and to keep on reducing to the gap to the very front  during the race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “The team is looking forward to Magny-Cours. It is a circuit  that has suited the BMW in the past. We have made some good steps  forward with the BMW M 1000 RR and I think the improvement that we  showed in race two at Navarra, we’ve got to keep building on that. The  Magny-Cours circuit is fast and flowing with some slower parts and we  feel that Tom and Michael can have a positive event. FP1 is going to  be really important; we need to find that early set-up for the guys  and end up with a strong races one and two. Overall, we are really  focused on going to Magny-Cours and having some consistent, fair  weather to give a true reflection of the progress we are making and we  look forward to the weekend.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am  definitely looking forward to the French round of the WorldSBK at  Magny-Cours. It’s a circuit which has given the BMW podium success in  the past and obviously for me my target is to add to that. The aim is  also to maintain our recent improvement in form that we found for  example at Navarra. That is the target for the weekend. Of course,  there is still work to be done with the new BMW M 1000 RR so we will  try our best to find the best balance and compromise to do this inside  the race weekend.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Magny-Cours is a track which I really enjoy riding. It  always suits me. It has a bit of everything; fast and flowing sectors,  stop-and-go corners, so it is a bit of a mix. Regarding the set-up of  the bike, you also need to find some compromise here and there because  it has all these different type of corners. I really love the first  sector; that is one of my favourite parts of the track, but also the  last sector is always nice for some good overtaking. I am looking  forward to the weekend. We have improved our BMW M 1000 RR a lot and  at Navarra, we struggled more with the high temperatures and I think  we will not have that at Magny-Cours, so hopefully we have a bit more  stable weekend. At Navarra, we made a big step lap-time wise in  qualifying. Unfortunately for me it was so tight that I was still  tenth, but if you look at the lap times, I made a huge step. We  improved the performance there, so that is what we really need at  Magny-Cours as well.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Magny-Cours is a  great circuit. We competed as wildcard starters in the French  Championship there last year. I am happy that we did that, as it means  that I am familiar with the circuit now. It is a very challenging  circuit, including a real range of corners. There is a pretty long  straight, some slow corners. Sometimes it flows and then you have a  bit of stop-and-go - it has a bit of everything. I hope that we make a  good start to the weekend, work well with the BMW from the word go and  that our race results then build on recent races.”  Track Facts Magny-Cours.Circuit        length4.411          km – clockwiseCorners17 – 9 right-handers, 8 left-handersPole        positionRightLongest        straightApprox. 900 metres (‘Golf’)Grip levelMediumTrack        layoutSome          sweeping turns, some stop-and-go passages, fast changes of directionStrain on        brakesRelatively highAmount at full        throttle32          % respectively 31 secondsTop speed \/ lowest        speed295          km\/h \/ 46 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityT5Key        factorsHigh          speed through the corners, stability, good delay on entry into          turns, wide range of performance \n"}

After an enthralling final round duel with    Bryson DeChambeau, Patrick Cantlay has secured the prestigious BMW    Championship 2021 title and his first Playoff victory. Victory had    to be decided in a playoff, after both tied on a total score of -27    – the lowest winning score to par in the history of the tournament.    DeChambeau was unable to match Cantlay’s birdie at the sixth extra    hole, having passed up several good opportunities to claim the win    during the playoff.“On behalf of everyone at BMW, I’d like to congratulate Patrick  Cantlay on winning the 2021 BMW Championship, and say thank you to  everyone who worked so hard to make this event a success,” said Oliver  Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. “We at BMW have  long considered the U.S. to be our second home, and this event is an  important part of what we do – beyond serving as a national platform  for our brand and products, it also provides an opportunity to raise  money for the Evans Scholars Foundation.”Cantlay and DeChambeau, who played together in the final group on  Sunday, quickly pulled away from the field to put on a duel that  seemed more like matchplay. With Cantlay one stroke behind at the  17th, it seemed that the result had been decided when he landed his  drive in the water. However, DeChambeau only recorded a bogey after a  chip shot went wrong, allowing Cantlay to stay in the running with a  bogey of his own. Cantlay then kept his sporting chances alive,  sinking a 21 yards on the 18th green while his rival missed from much  closer in.This pattern was set to continue in the playoff: DeChambeau put on a  brilliant display with the driver and his irons and on several  occasions he was presented with an easier putt to claim victory – but  he proved unable to sink them, while Cantlay got himself out of a  tight spot more than once with challenging putts. The decisive moment  came at the sixth extra hole for Cantlay, who had been by far the  strongest player on the greens throughout the week.South Korea’s Sungjai Im claimed third place, four strokes back  (-23), ahead of Rory McIlroy (NIR, -22) and Erik von Rooyen (RSA,  -21). Sixth place was shared by Dustin Johnson (USA) and Sergio García  (ESP, both - 20), who are approaching top form just in time for the  PGA TOUR Final and the Ryder Cup after middling seasons.All proceeds from the BMW Championship benefit the Evans Scholars  Foundation (ESF) and its mission of awarding full tuition and housing  college scholarships to caddies who would otherwise not be able to  afford to study. The BMW Championship has contributed more than 36  million dollars to the foundation since the tournament debuted in  2007. The final total for the 2021 tournament will be calculated in  around a week’s time. Alongside the ticket sales, the revenue from the  Pro-Am tournament also makes an important contribution. This year’s  Pro-Am event featured 23-time Olympic swimming champion Michael  Phelps, rapper Macklemore (both USA) and star photographer Paul Ripke  (GER) on the tee.The BMW Championship represented the final opportunity for US golfers  to score points for the Ryder Cup. The first six players in captain  Steve Stricker’s squad have now been confirmed: Collin Morikawa,  Dustin Johnson, Bryson de Chambeau, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas and  Patrick Cantlay. Stricker will call up another six wild card entrants  after the TOUR Championship. Qualification for the Ryder Cup Team  Europe will end after the BMW PGA Championship (Wentworth Club, 9th to  12th September).\n"}
{"prompt":"With the RE:BMW CIRCULAR LAB, the BMW Group shares an authentic insight into the company’s contribution towards holistic product development, the careful use of resources and the transformation towards a circular economy. The platform is also an invitation for collaboration and exchange. ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is launching its new  communication and experience platform “RE:BMW Circular Lab”.The RE:BMW Circular Lab is an invitation to accompany the BMW Group  on its journey of transformation into a circular economy. The RE:BMW  Circular Lab focuses on circular thinking and awareness of new,  sustainable courses of action. The BMW Group aims to use the RE:BMW  Circular Lab to raise awareness of circularity: circular rather than  linear. Rethinking the entire process. Reducing what can be reduced,  and reusing what can be maximally reused.Communication and experience platform for enhanced dialogue, cooperation and new perspectivesThe newly  created communication and experience platform RE:BMW Circular Lab is a  hybrid experience for every user. Its aim is to communicate the BMW  Group’s development as a sustainable organisation in a manner that is  transparent, interactive and accessible to all. Numerous features and  exciting, informative storytelling offer an authentic insight into the  BMW Group’s progress towards holistic product development, the  responsible use of resources, and its transformation into a circular economy.On this path, the BMW Group is guided by four basic principles:  RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE and RE:CYCLE. The BMW Group uses the RE:BMW  Circular Lab to tell the story of its transformation on the basis of  these principles; however, the platform is also an invitation to  collaborate and participate in discussion. To underscore the joy of  discovering new perspectives together, the RE:BMW Circular Lab invites  everyone to walk this path and shape the future collectively. Special  emphasis is placed on interactivity and dialogue: users can attend  analogue and digital workshops and use social media to experience the  BMW Group’s transformation into a circular economy in a variety of  ways. At the same time, insights into topics such as circular economy  and circular design aim to provide exciting ideas for personal action.Four guiding principles: RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE and  RE:CYCLEAn overview of the four principles of circular economy:RE:THINK – We keep circularity in mind during all our deliberations.The key principles are RE:DUCING, RE:USING and RE:CYCLING throughout  the process and far beyond: new materials, new technologies, new  processes and above all new ideas. We have to rethink all our  activities within the BMW Group and beyond.RE:DUCE – Using less to achieve more, wherever and  however we can.This opens up enormous creative scope for ideas and possibilities.  Imagine a new premium segment for the future, with new materials,  different components and flexible combinations. The art is to leave  things out without compromising on the driving experience.RE:USE – Extending the use of our products for as  long as we can.We extend and expand the value, possible applications and use of our  products by means of modernisation, digital functions and many other  options. New mobility concepts will provide an interior that can be  used in a variety of ways: for work meetings, for gatherings with  friends, and as an additional living room. And, naturally, to drive  from A to B. What is important is daily use and how we can inspire our  customers every day.RE:CYCLE – Keeping resources in circulation for as  long as we can.Using as many unmixed mono-materials as possible. Using materials  that are already in circulation, such as recycled plastic, recycled  aluminium and recycled steel. Detachable connections are essential for  easy dismantling. Being able to separate materials more easily makes  it easier to recycle them. What is important is the environmental  footprint of our products and our business operations as a whole.Have fun discovering circularity with the CIRCULAR  HEROESThe BMW Group is fundamentally resetting its  design strategy with circular design, which focuses on circularity  throughout the design process and far beyond. “Circular design is all  about creating more with less; fewer resources, more emotion,” says  Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President of BMW Group Design,  explaining the fascination of circular design.The principles of circular design are brought to life in a playful  manner by the CIRCULAR HEROES, four sustainable characters created by  Milanese architect and designer Patricia Urquiola who are constantly  exploring the possibilities of design, shape, materials and colour.  “Every time I work with BMW, I learn something new about mobility and  the possibilities it offers, but this particular project is  one-of-a-kind. I had the opportunity to experiment, work with utopian  models and even venture beyond design boundaries,” says designer  Patricia Urquiola, talking about her work on CIRCULAR HEROES. As each  CIRCULAR HERO represents the various types of bond between parts and  materials, each of them has their own specific approach.The BMW Group understands the RE:BMW Circular Lab as an invitation to  join it on the circular path and shape the future – with the goal of  discovering new perspectives together. At the occasion of  IAA Mobility in Munich the RE:BMW Circular Lab  will be presented at the BMW Group Open Space (Max-Joseph-Platz,  Munich). Visitors are invited to join interactive workshops. Discover the RE:BMW Circular Lab now:www.bmw.com\/circular-lab RE:BMW Circular LabThe BMW Group is pioneering the development of a circular economy and  efficient resource management.

During the tour of the plant,    the Lavertys took a look behind the scenes of the motorcycle    production and met many of the employees. From Spandau, they travelled to Berlin-Tempelhof. Laverty  had been planning to visit his BMW colleagues in the FIA Formula E  World Championship for a long time, and finally had the opportunity to  do so at the finale of the 2021 season – the BMW i Berlin E-Prix  presented by CBMM Niobium. It goes without saying that he also took to  the track on two wheels. Appropriately for the Formula E finale,  Laverty took the brand-new, fully-electric BMW CE 04 scooter for a  spin. “I really enjoyed my time in Berlin where I was able  to combine a visit to the BMW plant as well as the final round of the  Formula E World Championship,” Laverty said. “I felt a fantastic  camaraderie amongst my BMW colleagues both at the plant and at the  race track. I’d never before had the chance to visit somewhere quite  like the BMW plant, the level of technology and the quantity of bikes  produced daily is phenomenal!” “It was cool to get the  chance to ride the track layout on the brand new electric BMW CE 04  scooter,” Laverty continued. “The bike is such an impressive piece of  kit ideal for riding around the city. I was keen to test the bike’s  top speed on the closed circuit. I am a racer after all! The fight for  the Formula E world title went right down to the wire so as a race fan  it was great to be there and feel a part of it.

{"prompt":"Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you an overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. ->","completion":" DTM: Marco Wittmann enjoys more success in the BMW M6 GT3 at    the Nürburgring.Two weeks after taking victory at Zolder (BEL), Walkenhorst  Motorsport again had cause for celebration at round four of this  season’s DTM at the Nürburgring (GER): Marco Wittmann (GER), in the  #11 BMW M6 GT3, finished third in race two to claim another podium.  Wittmann had previously secured a promising third place on the grid in  Saturday’s qualifying for race one. However, the team knew that it  would be tough to achieve a podium finish, due to the extra 25  kilograms he was carrying following the victory at Zolder. At the end  of the 40-lap race, Wittmann crossed the finish line in fifth place. In a wet qualifying for race two on Sunday, the two-time DTM champion  again put the #11 BMW M6 GT3 third on the grid. The safety car then  made two appearances in an eventful race. As Walkenhorst Motorsport  had already come in for an early pit stop, Wittmann had to fight his  way back past those drivers that had not yet stopped at the restarts.  He did so superbly and ultimately came home in third place to secure  the final spot on the podium. “That was one of the most eventful races  of my DTM career,” said Wittmann. “The second restart was particularly  chaotic. We were five cars side-by-side coming into the first corner,  and I just hoped that I would somehow get through in one piece. I  passed five or six cars within just a few corners. It could easily  have gone wrong, but it worked out and I had a lot of fun.” Wittmann  now lies third in the Drivers’ Championship. The ROWE Racing team had a mixed weekend. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)  fought back from 18th on the grid to finish sixth in the #31 BMW M6  GT3 in Saturday’s race. In the Sunday race, the South African was in  with a shout of a podium finish until his BMW M6 GT3 was hit by  another car at the second restart. The result was a broken steering,  which forced van der Linde out of the race. His team-mate Timo Glock  (GER) had to settle for 19th place in the Saturday race. However, the  tide turned on Sunday when Glock, in the #16 BMW M6 GT3, worked his  way from 20th on the grid to eighth place. In doing so, he scored his  first points of the DTM season. After the race, he was promoted to  seventh place following a penalty handed to one of his rivals. DTM Trophy: One-two for the BMW M4 GT4 in the Eifel mountains.BMW M Motorsport teams in the DTM Trophy once again impressed with a  strong display at the Nürburgring (GER). Saturday’s race produced a  one-two for the BMW M4 GT4. The dominant driver was Ben Green (GBR) in  the #10 BMW M4 GT4 of FK Performance Motorsport. Starting from pole,  Green took a comfortable lights-to-flag victory. Michael Schrey (GER)  followed him home in second place, in the #2 BMW M4 GT4 of Hofor  Racing by Bonk Motorsport, to make it a BMW one-two. Schrey finished fourth in the Sunday race, but was then handed a  five-second penalty which saw him relegated to eighth place. The  best-placed BMW driver was Yann Zimmer (SUI) in the #50 BMW M4 GT4,  who finished sixth for FK Performance Motorsport. His team-mate Green  finished just behind him in seventh, ahead of Schrey. Green and Schrey  lie second and third in the Drivers’ Championship. Green trails the  current leader by just three points. BMW M2 Cup: Exciting battle for the championship lead.The new BMW M2 Cup was also at the Nürburgring (GER) at the weekend  for its third event of the season. An exciting battle for the  championship lead developed over the course of two thrilling races on  Saturday and Sunday. In Saturday’s opening race, Louis Henkefend (GER) took a comfortable  second win of the season in the #17 BMW M2 CS Racing. He crossed the  finish line almost six seconds clear of his closest rival. In doing  so, Henkefend extended his championship lead - briefly. “That was a  perfect race,” said Henkefend afterwards. “I grabbed the lead in turn  one and then had a clear track in front of me. I am really happy, as I  have scored valuable points in the championship.” Behind him, Fabian  Kreim (GER \/ #43) and Nicolas Hancke (GER \/ #99) were embroiled in a  hard-fought battle for second place. Kreim had the upper hand for a  long time, but it was Hancke who eventually prevailed and took second  place. As such, the podium featured Henkefend, Hancke and Kreim. Race two on Sunday was another thriller with the drivers in the BMW  M2 CS Racing cars making a host of spectacular manoeuvres on a dry  track. This time, it was Hancke who added victory to the second place  he recorded on Saturday. “It has been a long road onto the podium. I  was lacking a bit of pace in the first few races, but it was better  here at the Nürburgring. I am incredibly happy with the result,” said  the #99 BMW M2 CS Racing driver. Second place went to Kreim, with  Davit Kajaia (GEO \/ #5) taking third. Henkefend had to settle for  sixth place after receiving a penalty for failing to observe track limits. That result saw the championship lead change hands and Kreim is the  new leader with 97 points. Henkefend is now second with 95 points,  followed in third place by Hancke (76 points). The BMW Junior Team  visited the BMW M2 Cup paddock at the Nürburgring weekend. Dan Harper  (GBR), Neil Verhagen (USA) and Max Hesse (GER) called upon their  experience to give the drivers some valuable tips. More information on  the BMW M2 Cup is available on the official website: bmwm2cup.com.  There, you will find images and videos to download in the ‘Media’ section. GTWC: New driver pairings for Walkenhorst Motorsport.Walkenhorst Motorsport will compete with three established drivers  and three new drivers in the cockpits of the two BMW M6 GT3 in the  remaining two races of the season in the Endurance Cup, within the  FANATEC GT World Challenge Europe, at the Nürburgring (GER, 5th  September) and Barcelona (ESP, 10th October). Jake Dennis (GR) will  make his GT debut for BMW M Motorsport alongside regular driver David  Pittard (GBR) in the #34 car. Just a few days ago, he ended his rookie  season in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship with BMW i Andretti  Motorsport in third place in the overall standings. The third driver  in the all-British line-up will be Nick Yelloly (GBR). At the wheel of  the #35 BMW M6 GT3, regular drivers Martin Tomczyk (GER) and Thomas  Neubauer (FRA) will be ably assisted by Nick Catsburg (NED). Catsburg  and Yelloly not only won the 2020 Nürburgring 24 Hours together in a  BMW M6 GT3, but also raced for Walkenhorst Motorsport in the  Intercontinental GT Challenge so know the team very well. The change  in the driver line-up is due to a schedule clash with the DTM, in  which Marco Wittmann (GER) is driving for Walkenhorst Motorsport on  the same weekends, while Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Timo Glock  (GER) compete for ROWE Racing. Super GT Championship: BMW Team Studie in action at Suzuka.BMW Team Studie was back in action in the Japanese Super GT  Championship last weekend – this time at Suzuka (JPN). The  300-kilometre race was originally scheduled for the end of May, but  had to be postponed to August due to the coronavirus. The #7 BMW M6  GT3 of BMW Team Studie was once again driven by Seiji Ara and Tomohide  Yamaguchi (both JPN). In Saturday’s qualifying session, the duo was  14th fastest. However, in Sunday’s race, which took place under cloudy  skies and in temperatures of about 30 degrees, the #7 dropped back  through the field as the result of a drive-through penalty. In the  end, Ara\/Yamaguchi came home in 25th place. GT4 Scandinavia: Second event of the season at Gelleråsen.GT4 Scandinavia staged its second event of the season last weekend.  This time, Gelleråsen Arena (SWE) hosted the two races. Flying the  flag for BMW was the 996 Lestrup Racing Team with the #98 BMW M4 GT4.  Alternating at the wheel were Joakim Walde and Victor Bouveng (both  SWE). The duo had previously taken victory and claimed another podium  result in the Pro-Am class at the season-opener at Fällfors (SWE) in  June. At Gelleråsen, Walde\/Bouveng finished fourth, narrowly missing  out on another podium. They were then unfortunate and failed to finish  in race two on Sunday. BTCC: Milestone victory for Colin Turkington at Knockhill.Colin Turkington (GBR) reached a milestone at round five of the  British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) at Knockhill (GR) in  mid-August. In the first of the three races, Turkington took a  comfortable victory in the #2 BMW 330i M Sport run by Team BMW – this  was the team’s 100th victory in the BTCC and the 75th time they had  celebrated together with BMW. Turkington then finished runner-up in  race two. His team-mate Stephen Jelley (GBR) stepped onto the podium  after race three, having finished third in the #12 BMW 330i M Sport.  Turkington ended the third and final race of the weekend in eighth  place. After five race weekends, BMW tops the Manufacturer standings  with 439 points and a lead of 55 over its closest rivals.\n"}

BMW Motorrad Motorsport has rounded off the FIM    Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) race weekend at Navarra    (ESP) by meeting the objective of securing a top five result for the    BMW M 1000 RR. Tom Sykes (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team    claimed fifth spot in race two on Sunday afternoon. His team-mate    Michael van der Mark (NED) was classified in ninth. Jonas Folger    (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team finished twelfth, his    second-best race result of the season. Sykes started the Superpole race in the morning from third place. He  fell back a little at the start, taking the chequered flag in sixth  after ten laps. Van der Mark improved from tenth on the grid to ninth  and moved up to seventh for a while, before losing a place and  crossing the line in eighth position. Folger slipped back several  places after starting from 14th but was able to regain ground with  some overtaking manoeuvres as the sprint race progressed and finished 16th. Sunday saw a repeat of the previous day’s high temperatures and the  start of race two was delayed by ten minutes after a rider experienced  some issues on the grid. The lights went out at 14:10. After a  hard-fought first lap, Sykes and van der Mark had moved up from sixth  and eighth into fourth and fifth positions. However, Andrea Locatelli  (ITA, Yamaha) was able to pass van der Mark on lap three and overtook  Sykes one lap later. That put Sykes in fifth place, and he maintained  that top five position to the finish line after 22 laps. Van der Mark  was seventh for a large part of the race, but lost a place in the  closing stages and took the chequered flag in eighth position. After  the race, van der Mark was demoted by one place for exceeding track  limits on the final lap. Folger started the race from 14th on the  grid. After the start, he fell back briefly to 16th place but then  worked his way back up through the field, crossing the line in twelfth. Navarra hosted the seventh round of the 2021 WorldSBK season. The  racing continues in two weeks at Magny-Cours, France, from 3rd to 5th September. Quotes after race two at Navarra. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “That  was not an easy weekend for us, but we did manage to finish all three  races with Tom and Michael in the points. Jonas also scored points in  both main races. We didn't do as well as expected in the Superpole  race this morning in the cooler conditions, however we did manage to  claim sixth and eighth on the grid. That was certainly an improvement  compared to the most recent races for Michael. It then paid off in the  second race. After both made a good start, we were in fourth and fifth  positions. Tom then fell back to fifth place but did some great  defending against Alex Lowes. Michael certainly had more of a battle  on his hands but compared to yesterday we closed the gap to the  leaders by seven seconds. That's still not enough but it's going in  the right direction. In the heat today, they both chose a different  front tyre to yesterday, which will have made the biggest difference –  and now we have to learn from that for the next high-temperature  events coming up in Spain and Portugal.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It was a good step of improvement from yesterday. Tom rode  very well today; he dug really deep and withstood a lot of pressure  from Alex in the feature race and improved his overall race finish by  six or seven seconds from yesterday. Tom will be pleased with his  performance; we certainly are. A big shout out for him for that one.  Michael just kind of never got comfortable with the bike on the bumpy  circuit with a lot of front end chatter problems. He did well in his  Superpole Race to move up a row so that was good for his start. I  think he could have matched the pace of Alex and Tom in front of him  but he just had a couple of moments and it prevented him from keeping  that fifth, sixth, seventh position. Overall, it was not bad,  improvement from yesterday, we still have some work to do but we can’t  be too disappointed, so we can go away pretty happy.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was not a  bad weekend. With the high track temperatures, it was definitely a  challenging weekend. For the engines and for the riders, this kind of  temperatures got to the limit in the afternoon race. Overall we have  been trying to improve the set-up of the bike, certainly since as well  the hot test in Catalunya, but still we had some limitations. We had  some big problems in the race and we tried two different solutions  from the tyre but I had some limitations in some different aspects to  be fair. Even in race two I had some issues with turning and  understeer, also rear traction. I just worked hard to try to managing  the bike on brake pressure, in throttle openings and tried to make the  best race I could. I had a lot of pressure throughout the race but we  were able to deal with this. The best was lap one. We struggled to get  a run on anyone this weekend but there was a bit of confusion between  Alex Lowes and Andrea Locatelli and going into the turn at the end of  the back straight that was a good opportunity for me so I took that  and that gave me a good track position for the rest of the race.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was a tough Sunday. In this morning’s Superpole race I struggled quite  a lot with the front end of the bike. I just couldn’t attack anyone or  stay with anyone so I was a bit disappointed but anyway, I gained a  few starting positions for race two. I then had a good start but I  immediately felt that I was losing at the exits compared to the others  so I tried to push more on the front but I didn’t feel good and it was  quite a long and tough race. We need to improve that but at least we  got some points, we always keep trying and I am looking forward to  Magny-Cours now.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “The Superpole race  was pretty good, even if the start didn’t work out, which was the case  for all three races. We had problems with the clutch at the start all  through the weekend, and we need to work on that now. My pace was good  in the second half of the Superpole race. The weather was also a bit  cooler, which generally suits us. After a difficult start to race two,  the pace was also OK. I am not entirely happy with the weekend but we  did score some points. Of course, some other riders took a tumble and  that helped us but I made it through OK and we achieved our objective  of scoring points.” \n"}

Sykes finished the afternoon’s race in sixth position. His team-mate    Michael van der Mark (NED) crossed the line in seventh. Jonas Folger    (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team was also in the points,    finishing 14th. 1:36.546 minutes was the lap time recorded by Sykes in the morning’s  Superpole qualification. That enabled him to take the lead for a brief  period before finishing the 15-minute session with third place, on the  front row of the grid secured. Van der Mark ended the hard-fought  qualifying session in tenth position. Folger qualified in 14th place.  A special surprise lay in wait for van der Mark on the grid later when  BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director Marc Bongers and Shaun Muir, BMW  Motorrad WorldSBK Team Principal, presented the new father with a BMW Babyracer. Air temperatures had already reached 24 degrees Celsius by late  morning, climbing to over 30 degrees by the time the race began. Sykes  fell back a little in the turmoil at the start but then maintained  sixth position for the duration of the 23-lap race. He was within  striking distance of the top five for some time, but the gap then grew  larger. Van der Mark was able to get into eighth before moving up to  seventh on lap seven, where he remained until reaching the finish  line. Folger dropped back after losing ground at the start, however he  moved up to 14th as the race progressed to secure a points finish. Quotes after race one at Navarra. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Sixth and seventh in the race – that corresponds to where we  are at the moment. Our pace was clearly better in this morning’s  practice. The temperatures kept climbing though as the race  approached. We had already struggled with that in practice yesterday.  Tom did very well in qualifying to secure a great third place. He  established himself in sixth position relatively quickly in the race  and was able to maintain that. Michael had a relatively good  qualifying session. He finished tenth but was just a tenth of a second  away from fifth. In the race, he lost a few seconds again during the  first laps. Our aim for tomorrow should be fifth place instead of  sixth and seventh. It is important for us to deliver a strong  performance tomorrow in the Superpole race, with the aim of reaching  the top five. That is realistic for us this weekend.”  Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “I was really pleased with FP3 in the morning when Michael  set a quick pace very early so he had a good run of laps and was  confident going into Superpole. Equally Tom found a good set-up as  well and was pretty happy so we quickly confirmed the tyre choice for  the rear tyre. In Superpole, Tom as usually did a great job putting it  on the front row in the top-three. He made good use of his qualifying  tyre. We used a slightly different strategy for Michael; he ran one  exit with the ‘X’ tyre and then changed to the ‘Q’ tyre. It worked  really well and it was a much improved performance compared to Most.  Okay, tenth place was not where we wanted to be but it was an  improvement. In the race, Tom settled into a race pace which was  pretty much where he was at the end of the race. He could not gain  much advantage but settled into a good rhythm. Michael got stuck  behind a couple of riders and lost four, five seconds on the opening  few laps. Once he got by and settled into it, he could not bridge the  gap. Both riders struggled with the front in the heat. Overall, we  can’t be too dissatisfied with sixth and seventh. 20+ seconds off the  win is not where we want to be but we will try to close that gap tomorrow.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was not  too bad. We had a good qualifying and starting from the front row is  always a nice target. Coming off the start, another rider came by me  and almost took my handle bar so I had to close the gas and a Kawasaki  had gone by. So the first lap wasn’t very good and then, to be honest,  behind Alex Lowes on the first couple of laps, it was just a bit too  steady so I need to have a look at that for tomorrow. I need to try to  get a better start and first couple of laps but after that I just  settled into the rhythm that we found yesterday afternoon. It looks  like everyone was suffering a little bit more today because the times  were slower than yesterday afternoon. I really struggled with the  front end of the bike with the turning and some of the rear traction  so for sure it was a difficult race to manage. We had to change the  way to approach some corners et cetera and try to find a way to ride  around those problems so we’ve got a lot of work to do tonight and  hopefully we can improve the set-up for these hot conditions tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “To  be honest, I was expecting a lot more. This morning, we made a huge  step in performance and in lap time consistency. Also in Superpole,  we’ve made a good step. I was tenth but the gap to P5 was really  close. I was happy with that, but in the warmer conditions in the race  the bike just did not react like in the cooler conditions. It’s normal  but I struggled too much so we need to find a solution for tomorrow.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Our start position  in the race wasn’t bad. Unfortunately, I didn’t make a great start. I  had a wheelie and lost a few places. On the second lap, I then went  straight on in turn 1 while I was trying to overtake another rider. I  was back in 21st or 22nd then, but my lap times were nearly as fast as  the riders around tenth. Now we have to analyse what happened, as the  wheelie at the start was unusual and has not happened at all during  practice. We will carry on working and see what we can achieve from  14th on the grid tomorrow.” \n"}

But this motto is now gaining an  additional meaning as the automotive world in Leipzig welcomes a  wealth of new paint options. Starting today, the plant is finishing  vehicles in Individual paintwork as well. The first BMW 1 Series and  BMW 2 Series Gran Coupes for those who prefer less ordinary colours  are resplendent in Speed Yellow, San Marino Blue, Verde Ermes Green  and Nardo Grey.Black and white are still among the most popular colours for cars,  but customers are increasingly seeking more expressive and individual  paintwork. Dealerships now offer 160 Individual colour options for the  BMW 1 Series and BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe, which are going down well  with customers despite the surcharge for matt and Individual finishes.  Leipzig’s order books for vehicles with Individual finishes have  filled up nicely until the end of the year, and the next major order  is for 180 BMW 118d vehicles in Hockenheim Silver, Ruby Red and Sepia  Violet for BMW Japan.The lead time for special finishes in a preferred Individual colour  is about ten weeks. Customers can even create their own colours, which  will be specially mixed and used on their car only.So that Individual finishes can be applied to smaller model series  too, the existing system has now been upgraded to handle the special  paints. In addition, new paint supply systems and a new mixing area  have been integrated. The paintshop can now paint five vehicles a day  in colours from the Individual range.The integration of the special new colours means extra service and  supervision work for the paintshop team compared with what’s needed  for standard finishes. Some processes, such as sign-off, can no longer  be carried out by automated means and have to be performed manually  instead, so the paintshop team has been expanded. For matt finishes  the process is especially time-consuming and complex, as defects  cannot be treated in the conventional way that is used with gloss  finishes. Instead, each matt-finished car takes 30 minutes longer to  prepare. There are currently two matt colour options: Frozen Black and  Frozen Orange.Individual paint finishes may only just be starting at Plant Leipzig,  but already the orders are revealing a few special favourites:  yellows, blues, reds and violet shades are especially popular at the  moment, bringing plenty of colour not only to the streets but also to  Plant Leipzig’s paintshop and production lines.The full range of options can be experienced via the BMW Individual Visualiser:https:\/\/visualizer.bmw-individual.com\/Ipps\/bmwoac?market=80001-de&pdf=1&qrcode=1&header=1&page=imc&lang=en&dc=1-1#top\n"}

After the debut of ‘Autodrom Most’ (CZE) on the calendar, now    ‘Circuito de Navarra’ in northern Spain will host the WorldSBK for    the first time. This coming weekend (20th to 22nd August), the    seventh round of the 2021 season will be held at the track. BMW    Motorrad Motorsport had the opportunity to familiarise itself with    the new track back in June. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team with    riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED), as well as    Bonovo MGM Racing and Jonas Folger (GER) completed a test at the    track with their BMW M 1000 RR Superbikes. The ‘Circuito de Navarra’ is located near Los Arcos in the regional  community of Navarra, around 60 kilometres southwest of Pamplona. The  modern racetrack, just under 4 kilometres in length, was opened in  June 2010. Since then, various car and motorcycle championships have  held events at the track, including the Spanish Superbike Championship ESBK. Quotes ahead of the Navarra round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “We’re already really looking forward to the race weekend at  Navarra. We got an initial impression of the track during testing in  June. It’s rather untypical of Superbike tracks, and first gear is  needed in several places. Now we need to see what awaits us there –  also in terms of the temperatures in August. We can use the  information and base set-up from testing to prepare the BMW M 1000 RR  for Superpole and the races. We confirmed our good race pace at Most,  and the goal is to convert this into corresponding results at Navarra  so we need to be strong in Superpole to get a good start position for  the races. I’d like to take this opportunity to congratulate the new  parents Michael and Nadieh – and welcome to the world Mason van der Mark!” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We finished Most in a reasonably strong situation. We can  still see the progression of the BMW M 1000 RR. We already had a test  at Navarra and we feel we have a good base setting. It has been a busy  time for our riders since Most – congratulations to Michael and Nadieh  on the birth of their first baby boy, Mason! Also last week, we tested  with Tom at Barcelona which gave him a good, positive outcome. So all  in all, we have got a lot of things to look forward to going to  Navarra. The team can start FP1 in a strong position and hopefully we  can carry on the progression and aim towards the podium.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I’m looking  forward to keeping the momentum going, with the races now coming quite  fast. So we aim to build on what we understood when we were testing in  Navarra some weeks ago – and also recently on the back of a test at  Barcelona which was in very hot conditions. Obviously, it looks like  Navarra will be warm. It’s a new circuit again for everybody so it  will be interesting to see how the weekend goes, but ultimately the  plan is to continue working with what we found in testing with the BMW  M 1000 RR and hopefully we can transfer that kind of set-up into the  hot track at Navarra and keep improving our results all of the time. I  also want to take this opportunity to say massive congratulations to  Michael and Nadieh on their fabulous new addition to the family, their  little baby boy. That’s a massive achievement in life and I wish them  all the best.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  has been an exciting time since I returned from Most. On Thursday  evening after the race weekend, Mason was born and it is great be able  to spend some days with the family before heading to the next round.  Now we will race at Navarra, and it is always good to have a new track  on the calendar. We have been testing there and it is quite different  compared to other tracks. It is really narrow and overtaking can be  hard. It’s good that we have done a test there, even if our bike has  changed quite a lot since then, so I am curious to find out how it  will work. The first goal for the weekend is to qualify a little bit  better. In Most I was a bit unlucky in qualifying with some traffic, I  must say, but we’ve seen that for example on Saturday and Sunday we  made a huge improvement on lap times and also pace-wise so it seems  that we really found a good way with the set-up of the bike. Hopefully  we will find that right set-up at Navarra pretty soon so we are right  at the point from the start.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “We got to know the  Navarra track during the two-day test in June. It’s not an easy track  and it will be a challenge, but we will give it our all, and I hope  that we can improve and find our way to the front. The most important  goal for us all is to bring home points this weekend.”  Track Facts Navarra*.Circuit        length3.933          km – clockwiseCorners15 – 9 right-handers, 6 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight630          metres (start-finish straight)Grip levelMediumTrack        layoutVery          narrow (slow corners), a bit bumpy surface, changes in elevationStrain on        brakesLower averageAmount at full        throttleAprrox. 18,4 % respectively 18 secondsTop speed \/ lowest        speed55          km\/h \/ 295 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityEnd of the back straightKey        factorsStability on bumps, power management when          accelerating from the slow corners, agility *Information based on testing \n"}
{"prompt":" Hydrogen fuel cell drive train delivers sustainable driving pleasure as new element of BMW i brand.  Worldwide-unique combination of high-performance fuel cell and optimised power battery underlines BMW Group's leading drive system expertise.  Small series for demonstration and testing purposes to be  launched in 2022.   ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is systematically pushing  forward with development of hydrogen fuel cell technology as an  additional option for sustainable individual mobility. Two years after  unveiling the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT concept car, the company will  present the BMW iX5 Hydrogen at the IAA Mobility 2021 in Munich.  Currently still in series development, the Sports Activity Vehicle  (SAV) with hydrogen fuel cell drive train will be one of several  vehicles visitors can experience as they are driven along the Blue  Lane connecting the main exhibition grounds with other exhibition  venues in the city centre.A small series of the BMW iX5 Hydrogen, developed on the basis of the  BMW X5, will be used for demonstration and testing purposes from the  end of next year. Its hydrogen fuel cell system is further proof of  the BMW Group’s leading development expertise in the field of electric  drive technologies. “With its high-performance fuel cell and    optimised power battery, the BMW iX5 Hydrogen’s drive system is    unique in the world,” said Juergen Guldner, head of BMW  Group Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology and Vehicle Projects. “With this,  we are forging new paths for sustainable driving pleasure.”With the right conditions, hydrogen fuel cell technology has the  potential to become a further pillar in the BMW Group’s drive train  portfolio for local CO2-free mobility. The BMW i brand, which is  entirely geared towards locally emission-free mobility, could in the  future also offer vehicles with hydrogen fuel cell drive trains, in  addition to battery-electric models such as the BMW i3, BMW iX3, BMW  iX and BMW i4. Provided the hydrogen is produced using renewable  energy and the necessary infrastructure is available, this technology  can complement the BMW Group’s electrified drive train portfolio –  and, in particular, meet the needs of customers who do not have their  own access to electric charging infrastructure, frequently drive long  distances or desire a high degree of flexibility.Model-specific design elements 3D-printed for locally    emission-free Sports Activity Vehicle. The BMW iX5  Hydrogen is a modern luxury Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) that  combines ground-breaking drive technology with the powerful  proportions, convenience and versatility of a BMW X model.    Individual exterior and interior design elements  highlight the car’s ties to the BMW i brand, as well as its specific  drive technology. The inner edging of the BMW kidney grille, the  inserts in the 22- inch aerodynamic wheels and the attachments in the  outer portion of the rear apron are all in BMW i Blue. The entry sills  and cover trim for the instrument panel also sport a “hydrogen fuel  cell” badge.The mesh inserts covering the cooling air openings at the front of  the BMW iX5 Hydrogen, as well as the rear apron and its diffuser  element, also have their own unique design. The ornamental grilles  covering the BMW kidney grille, the lower and two outer air inlets and  the body elements for the lower rear end trim all come from the BMW  Group’s Additive Manufacturing Campus, which uses 3D printing to  produce prototype and standard parts. Additive manufacturing enables  fast and highly flexible production of components – some of which have  geometric shapes that cannot be realised with conventional production methods.Systematic sustainability: Aerodynamic wheels and tyres made    of natural rubber.The BMW iX5 Hydrogen’s aerodynamic wheels come with sustainably  produced tyres made of natural rubber and rayon. The raw materials for  this are extracted in compliance with the standards of the independent  Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) organisation. The BMW Group is the  first automotive manufacturer worldwide to use Pirelli tyres made  exclusively from certified natural rubber and the wood-based material  rayon in its production vehicles.Hallmark BMW driving dynamics, strong long-distance capabilities.The BMW iX5 Hydrogen combines fuel cell technology with a  fifth-generation BMW eDrive. The drive system uses hydrogen as fuel by  converting it into electricity in a fuel cell – delivering an  electrical output of up to 125 kW\/170 hp, with water vapour as the  only emission. This drive power also enables it to maintain    consistently high speeds over longer distances. The  electric motor was developed from the fifth-generation BMW eDrive  technology also used in the BMW iX. In coasting overrun and braking  phases, it serves as a generator, feeding energy into a power battery.  The energy stored in this power battery is also utilised for  particularly sporty driving manoeuvres – delivering a system    output of 275 kW\/374 hp and guaranteeing the brand's  signature driving experience.The hydrogen needed to supply the fuel cell is stored in two 700-bar  tanks made of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), which together  hold almost six kilograms of hydrogen. “Filling up the    hydrogen tanks only takes three to four minutes – so there  are no limits on using the BMW iX5 Hydrogen for long distances, with  just a few, short stops in-between,” explains Guldner.Hydrogen as part of global activities for CO2-free  mobility. According to a report by the International  Energy Agency (IEA), hydrogen offers considerable potential as    a future energy source in connection with global energy  transition activities. Thanks to its storage and transport  capabilities, hydrogen can be used for a wide variety of applications.  Most industrialised countries are therefore adopting hydrogen  strategies and backing them up with roadmaps and concrete projects. In  the transport sector, hydrogen can become a further technology option,  alongside battery-electric mobility, for shaping sustainable  individual mobility in the long term. However, this will depend on  competitive production of sufficient quantities of hydrogen from green  power, as well as expansion of the corresponding filling  infrastructure, which is already being intensively pursued in many countries.The BMW Group welcomes and supports activities to promote innovation  in Germany and Europe that will help build a hydrogen economy and  accelerate production of green hydrogen. These specifically include  the large-scale hydrogen projects classified as Important Projects of  Common European Interest (IPCEI). The projects that comprise this  European Union initiative, supported in Germany by the Federal  Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Federal Ministry of Transport,  span the entire value chain – from hydrogen production to transport to  applications in industry.\n"}

The world title was within touching distance, but luck    deserted Jake Dennis (GBR) during the farewell race for BMW in the    ABB FIA Formula E World Championship. Despite retiring from the    season finale at the BMW i Berlin E-Prix presented by CBMM Niobium    (GER), he completed his rookie season in Formula E with an    outstanding third position in the drivers’ standings. BMW i Andretti    Motorsport finishes the season in sixth place in the team    championship. This race marks the end of BMW’s works involvement in    Formula E after recording seven race wins in three years as a works    team and seven years as Official Vehicle Partner. The home race in    Berlin provided BMW Group with a stage to demonstrate the current    range of fully-electric production vehicles whose drivetrains    benefited significantly from the knowledge gained in the competitive    environment of Formula E. Jake Dennis started the 15th race of the season from ninth on the  grid, just four points off the lead in the overall standings. The race  was quickly over for two of his title rivals after a collision between  Mitch Evans (NZL, Jaguar) and Edoardo Mortara (SUI, Venturi). That put  Dennis in a promising position for the restart, only for a jammed rear  axle to put paid to his world title ambitions as he slid into the wall  and was forced to retire. Nyck de Vries (NED, Mercedes) went on to  secure the title but Dennis was still able to finish third in the  drivers’ championship with 91 points despite his retirement – an  outstanding performance in his rookie Formula E season. Maximilian Günther (GER) was 18th place in qualifying and a bold race  strategy was not enough for a points finish. He finished 15th, ending  the season in 16th position in the overall standings. BMW i Andretti  Motorsport completed its final season as a BMW works team in sixth  place in the team championship with 157 points. Reactions to Race 15 in Berlin. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“We came into this final race with a really good chance of winning  the World Championship with Jake. Practice sessions went not quite as  smoothly as yesterday and in qualifying he again just missed Super  Pole by a few hundredths of a second. Still, he was in a good position  having most of his title contenders behind him. Then at the restart  after the unfortunate collision between Mitch Evans and Edoardo  Mortara we suspect a technical issue with Jakes car that we yet have  to analyse. The rear axle locked and Jake was just a passenger. At  that point his championship hopes were over, but I told him: ‘You must  have had a pretty good season if you are disappointed with third place  in the championship’. If someone had offered that position to us after  the first two rounds, we would have bitten his hand off. Jake did an  amazing job in his rookie season with his two race wins. Maximilian  went in the wrong direction with his setup and didn’t really have a  competitive car in this race unfortunately. Today we are disappointed,  but once all has settled in, I think we can be very proud of what we  have achieved together as BMW and Andretti Formula E and of the hard  work that everyone has put into it to get us to this point. Of course  we would have loved to continue like this but it is not to be. We are  excited what Season 8 swill bring for us. I say thank you to  everybody, not only the team on the front line but also everybody in  the background who helped to make this project a success. Thank you  very much!” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 8th    place, race result: 5th place, points: 91, driver    standings: 3rd place):“It’s a shame that the title fight ended like this – not only for me  but for Mitch Evans and Edoardo Mortara as well. Three title  contenders out of the race early. It felt like there was a technical  failure at the rear, but I don’t know yet what exactly happened. The  rear tyres complete locked before I even had a chance to do anything.  It’s a sad end, but nevertheless we had an incredible season and a  want to thank everybody for working so hard and giving me the chance  to fight for the world championship.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    18th place, race result: 15th place, points:    66, driver standings: 16th place):“Starting from 18th, our aim was of course to make up as much ground  as possible. We went for a bold strategy but unfortunately that did  not pay off. I made some progress at the start and had a few good  fights but we noticed early on that the level of grip wasn’t quite  there, and that we were a bit off the pace. I gave it my all at the  end but a points finish was just out range, sadly. I would have liked  to have managed that to finish the season. Many thanks to BMW for some  great times in Formula E. It was an honour for me to be part of it for  two years. We enjoyed many great moments together as BMW i Andretti  Motorsport and I will never forget them.” Summary: BMW i Andretti Motorsport in Formula E.BMW i Andretti Motorsport competed as a works team for the first time  in Season 5 – and made a perfect start. António Félix da Costa (POR)  claimed pole position and the win as the BMW iFE.18 debuted in Diriyah  (KSA). Alexander Sims (GBR) also gave the team a perfect start to  Season 6 in the same location, recording two pole positions and a win  in the BMW iFE.20. Maximilian Günther (GER) then gave two triumphant  performances in Santiago (CHI) and at the home race in Berlin. Season  7 saw Günther claim his third win for BMW i Andretti Motorsport in the  BMW iFE.21 in New York City (USA). Jake Dennis topped the podium twice  in his Formula E rookie season, at Valencia (ESP) and at his home race  in London (GBR). In three seasons together, BMW i and Andretti  Autosport celebrated a total of seven wins, five pole positions and  twelve podiums. Lessons Learned: Formula E as TechLab for BMW i production drivetrains.After seven years as ‘Official Vehicle Partner’ for Formula E and  three seasons of works team racing, the BMW Group is withdrawing from  the race series. The farewell appearance included a look at the BMW  iX, the BMW i4, the MINI Cooper SE (energy consumption in kWh\/100 km  combined (NEDC): 14.9 - 16.9 kWh\/100km, combined CO2  emissions (NEDC): 0 g\/km) and the BMW CE 04 Scooter, which are  spearheading the current range of fully-electric vehicles. From the word go, the driving force behind the involvement of BMW i  and BMW Motorsport in Formula E was the development of innovative  technologies in the area of electromobility, which are also relevant  for series production. Most of the opportunities for technology  transfer between motor racing and production have largely been  exhausted. An enormous amount of knowledge gained has been included in  the fifth generation of E-drivetrains, which are already on the road  in the BMW iX3 (energy consumption in kWh\/100 km: 17.8-17.5 (NEDC);  19.0-18.6 (WLTP); electric range (WLTP) in km: 450-458)* and will  continue to be applied in the BMW iX, the BMW i4 and other  fully-electric vehicle models. Examples:\n"}

He did not manage  to reach Super Pole from group one in qualifying, but claimed eighth  place on the grid and a good start position. Günther began the race in  tenth place. Both BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers dropped back a bit at the  start, before working their way back into the points with some  efficient driving and smart use of Attack Mode. Dennis was battling  for third place right to the end and was delighted to have finished  fifth, scoring ten points. Victory went to Lucas di Grassi (BRA, Audi). The 15th and final race of the season is on Sunday at the same  location. It will take place on the reversed Berlin-Tempelhof circuit  and starts at 15:30 CEST. Reactions to Race 14 in Berlin. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“The Berlin event started really well for us with Jake showing very  strong pace in both practice sessions. Unfortunately he got caught up  a little bit on his flying qualifying lap, which cost him one and a  half tenths and a place in the Super Pole shootout. Still we had solid  start positions with both drivers. We hung in there in the race, made  clever use of energy, tyres and Attack Mode. Both drivers made good  passes when they needed to and defended well when they needed to. The  outcome for Jake is third place in the championship. He has everything  to play for tomorrow. Maximilian scored important points for the team.  Looking at how close it is in the standings, I’m really excited for  tomorrow and confident we can have a strong finish to the season.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 8th    place, race result: 5th place, points: 91, driver    standings: 3rd place):“My aim before the race was to finish fifth but then we had a really  bad start and lost some positions. After that we came back strong and  the car behaved very well. At the end we didn’t quite have the pace  anymore to fight for the podium to be honest. Being a rookie entering  the final race of the season just four points behind the leader sounds  really good. To be fair it’s just incredible. I’m so proud if what we  have done here at BMW i Andretti Motorsport. I’ll just enjoy the race  tomorrow and have no pressure. If I fail, we still had an amazing  season together. If I do good, I might win the championship. I’m excited.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    10th place, race result: 8th place, points:    66, driver standings: 14th place):“Unfortunately, I damaged the nose of my car in the first corner  after the start which made me lose some ground. However, we got our  race set up well and had energy and tyre wear under control. In the  end, eighth place was the best we could have achieved I think. Getting  both cars into the points was very important for the team.

Calder Foundation and BMW are  pleased to announce the presentation of the Calder BMW Art Car    (Artist’s Proof) for the opening day of “Alexander Calder:  Minimal \/ Maximal” at the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin on August 22,  2021. Conceived by BMW Group Classic for the Calder Foundation, the  Artist’s Proof realizes Calder’s dream of creating his own example of  the first BMW Art Car, operating as the kinetic work of art that the  artist intended.Alexander S. C. Rower, grandson of the artist and president of the  Calder Foundation, recalls, “I first encountered the BMW Art Car as a  kid at the opening of my grandfather’s far-ranging retrospective at  the Whitney Museum in 1976. I asked him about the roar of its M49  engine, and he smiled and told me he wanted to make one for himself.  He died just a few weeks later. Ever since, I have dreamed of  realizing his wish to bring the car to life to experience its full  glory in motion. I am thrilled that that day has finally come, and  that the car will be activated for the opening of the Neue  Nationalgalerie’s ‘Minimal \/ Maximal’ exhibition, which highlights the  key element of social activation so fundamental to Calder’s work.”It is important to note that the Artist’s Proof is not a replica,  clone, copy, reproduction, facsimile, or 1:1 of the 1975 Calder BMW  Art Car. Rather, it is the identical Artist’s Proof that Calder was  entitled to but was never realized until now. Meticulously built from  an original BMW 3.0 CSL, the Artist’s Proof will carry the same  Vehicle Identification Number, with the suffix “AP” (227592\/AP).The story behind Calder’s legendary BMW Art Car originated not in the  automotive but rather the aeronautical sphere. In 1974, French  auctioneer and racecar driver Hervé Poulain visited Calder at his  studio in Saché, France, to propose translating the artist’s recent  collaboration with Braniff International Airways into the world of  cars; Calder’s painted DC-8-62 airplane, inaugurated in 1973, had been  wildly successful. BMW and Poulain commissioned Calder to paint a  design on a BMW to be raced at the 24 Heures du Mans in 1975. The  result was a momentous collaboration that spurred an entire Art Car  program at BMW—a prestigious, high-profile crossover with the art  world. After Calder’s Art Car was raced at Le Mans, it was  subsequently exhibited at the artist’s sprawling retrospective at the  Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City in 1976, where it  occupied a prominent place in the museum for the run of the  exceptionally popular exhibition.Poulain recalls, “It was a thrilling moment as a young driver to meet  the great American artist Alexander Calder at his home in Saché.  Racing what became the first in a storied tradition of prestigious Art  Cars is a memory I will never forget. I am delighted that more people  will now get to experience Calder’s vision, thanks to this new  Artist’s Proof.”The Calder Foundation and BMW Group Classic consulted with key  members of the original team to realize this project, including not  only Poulain but also Jochen Neerpasch, who was a key supporter of the  BMW Art Car series from the beginning, and Walter Maurer, who did the  technical painting of the Calder BMW Art Car in 1975 as well as of the  Artist’s Proof in 2021.Following its debut in Berlin, the Calder BMW Art Car (Artist’s  Proof) will be presented at The Bridge in Bridgehampton, New York, on  September 18, 2021. The Calder Foundation will subsequently lend  Calder’s Artist’s Proof to exhibitions worldwide.On the occasion of 50 years of its cultural engagement, BMW has  recently joined forces with Acute Art to initiate a unique virtual  exhibition. Since July 21 and for the first time ever, the BMW Art Car  by Alexander Calder and the renowned BMW Art Car Collection are being  exhibited in augmented reality (AR) via the free Acute Art app,  marking the first time that the digital rolling sculptures are  accessible to everyone around the world at any time.Not only BMW Group Cultural Engagement but also the BMW 3.0 CSL  celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2021. The BMW 3.0 CSL is  not only a legend as a BMW Art Car. As a serial version, it was  launched alongside the BMW 3.0 CSi in 1971 and was defined by the  characteristics of its name: coupé, sport, lightweight. Produced in  small series beginning in 1971, the lightweight coupés quickly became  particularly important. The BMW 3.0 CSL was raced with the famous BMW  Motorsport Works colors from 1973 on and triumphed six times in the  European Touring Car Championship. The BMW 3.0 CSL is still one of the  most iconic cars in the BMW automobile history.Calder BMW Art Car (Artist’s Proof), 1975 \/ 2021 on  display:Alexander Calder: Minimal \/ MaximalNeue  NationalgaleriePotsdamer Straße 50, 10785 BerlinSunday,  August 22, 2021, from 10:00am–6:00pmThe Bridge1180 Millstone Rd, Bridgehampton, NY  11932Saturday, September 18–Sunday, September 19, 2021 For further questions please contact:Prof. Dr  Thomas Girst BMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Head of Cultural Engagement Telephone: +49 89 382    24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comwww.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.deLily LyonsCalder FoundationDirector of External  AffairsPhone: +1 212 334 2424Email: extaffairs@calder.orgWeb:    www.calder.org Christoph GontardBMW Group Corporate and Governmental  AffairsHead of BMW Group Classic Communication Phone: +49  89 382 53404Email: christoph.gontard@bmwgroup.comWeb:  www.press.bmwgroup.com\n"}

Ending on an absolute highlight, the BMW i Berlin E-Prix    presented by CBMM Niobium (GER) this weekend is also the sporting    highly exciting finale of Season 7 of the ABB FIA Formula E World    Championship and BMW i’s farewell as ‘Official Vehicle Partner’ and    as a works team in the first-ever race series for all-electric    formula cars. For BMW i Andretti Motorsport and its drivers Jake    Dennis (GBR) and Maximilian Günther (GER), anything is possible in    the battle for the world championship titles in the team and driver    standings. Dennis is in fourth place going into the final two races    at the Berlin-Tempelhof airport grounds. In the support programme    for the races, BMW Group will present its range of electric    production cars, the drive of which benefitted greatly from    development in Formula E. “BMW i has been a partner of Formula E from the outset, and we are  delighted to conclude this unique partnership, after seven successful  years, with another highlight, the title sponsorship at our home event  in Berlin,” said Stefan Ponikva, Vice President Brand Communication  and Brand Experience BMW Group. “I would like to thank Formula E and,  on behalf of the whole organisation, Alejandro Agag, Alberto Longo and  Jamie Reigle. The BMW i Berlin E-Prix will be the highlight of the  season for us. As well as the fully-electric BMW i3s and BMW iX3, we  also have the MINI Electric Pacesetter in action as the safety car and  are delighted to be able to present our latest products, including the  BMW i4 and BMW iX, to the guests and spectators permitted at the  event. We have our fingers crossed for our drivers Jake Dennis and  Maximilian Günther, and the BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team at the  season finale.” Dennis goes into the final two races in fourth place in the overall  standings with 81 points after his second win of the season at the  London E-Prix (GBR), and trails leader Nyck de Vries (NED, Mercedes)  by just 14 points. Günther has 62 points to his name. In the team  standings, BMW i Andretti Motorsport is in fifth place with 143  points, which sees them trail the top spot by 22 points. Both of the races at the weekend will use two track versions familiar  from last year in Tempelhof. Saturday’s race will be held on the  standard track. Then the track will be driven in the opposite  direction on Sunday. This will require the track to be converted,  which will take place overnight. Saturday’s race gets underway at 2.00  p.m. CEST, while Sunday’s race starts at 3.30 p.m. CEST. Quotes ahead of the BMW i Berlin E-Prix: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“Berlin will be a very special race weekend for the whole team; not  only is it the end of the championship and there is all to play for,  but it is also the final two rounds for the factory partnership  between BMW i and Andretti Formula E. A partnership that came together  formally in Season 5, it started with a pole position and a win, and  hopefully we can close out together in a similar manner. I am sure  there will be many mixed emotions come the end of the weekend. The  championship points are so close, almost anything can happen between  Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon. The unique nature of the track  surface means that tyre management will be key. The weather also looks  to be quite hot and that should suit the efficiency of the BMW i drivetrain.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21):“It feels like it was just yesterday that I contest my first Formula  E race in Diriyah. We’ve come a long way since then, won two races in  my rookie season and are right in the middle of the battle for the  world championship. I’m really excited for Berlin and will give it my  all to make use of the momentum and drive for the title. But we can  already be very proud of what we have achieved as a team this season.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21):“I’m super excited for the season finale in Berlin. Two track layouts  in two days is a real challenge, and one that we have prepared well  for. We are still right there in the battle for the title in both  championships, and the home fans at the track make the atmosphere even  more special. We will give it everything we’ve got once again for the  final two races for BMW as a works team in Formula E.”  TRACK FACTS BERLIN.Track length2.355 km. Saturday:            Anti-clockwise. Sunday: Clockwise.Corners10 – In both layouts 5 right            turns and 5 left turns.Track surfaceThe special airfield surface            causes high levels of tyre wear.

The Autodrom Most debut in the FIM Superbike World    Championship ended with a solid day of racing for BMW Motorrad    Motorsport. In the Superpole race on Sunday morning, Tom Sykes (GBR)    and Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team    finished fifth and eleventh. In the afternoon’s second race, van der    Mark climbed ten places to finish as the best-placed BMW rider in    seventh. Sykes came home in ninth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from BMW    Team Bonovo MGM Racing narrowly missed out on the points in race    two, finishing 16th. First on Sunday morning was the Superpole race, which Sykes started  from fourth place. He lost one position in the turmoil at the start,  before holding onto fifth place right through to the finish after ten  laps of racing. Van der Mark climbed into eleventh place from 17th on  the grid. Folger was 18th, having started 21st. Van der Mark gave another eye-catching performance in race two on  Sunday afternoon, gaining ten positions with an impressive fightback.  Having started 17th, he crossed the finish line 22 laps later in  seventh place, just half a second outside the top five. After the  start, van der Mark had to take evasive measures to avoid a multi-bike  crash, before launching his assault on the front of the field. By lap  three he had reached the top ten. After seven laps, he was running  ninth. The Dutchman climbed into seventh place on lap 17. Team-mate  Sykes spent the majority of the race in the top six, but then fell  back a few positions to ninth in the final third of the race. Folger,  who again started from 21st place, raced into 17th place on the  opening lap. He then continued to make progress into 16th place and  eventually crossed the finish line in that position, just 0.210  seconds outside the points. Quotes after race two at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “I  think we can be pleased with the results today. Tom had a very good  Superpole race and didn’t have to go straight on at T1 so he could  stick in his fifth position and brought it home very well. Michael had  a good catch up all the from 17th, but the first lap was difficult and  he lost nearly five seconds to the front runners in the first lap. He  finished one second off P9 which would have given us ninth position on  the grid, but it was not meant to be so we started 17th again with  Mickey for the feature race. In race two, Michael confirmed his very  good pace and to come all the way from 17th to seventh is pleasing,  although this confirms that you need to start in those first three  rows. With Tom, we will have to see which issues he had. He was still  quite close in the group but couldn’t hold his position and dropped  down to ninth. Jonas had another difficult day so we will have to  investigate what is going on there, but he doesn’t have his mojo at  the moment. Overall, it was nice to be in Most, and to have the fans  back with us. It is a nice track layout however with some safety  points to be raised for next year.”  Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “The Superpole race gave us everything we had hoped, all but  the fact we didn’t quite get that ninth position that Michael needed  to give him an increased grid position. Tom made a really good job on  the ‘X’ tyre and did well to finish fifth. It was a real shame for  Mickey; if he had just got into ninth position it would have made a  real difference in main feature race. Nevertheless, Michael did really  well not to get tangled up in a crash in the first corner and got to  work really quick and one by one picked off the riders in front of  him. I think another lap and we could have had sixth, but it proves  how strong Michael is feeling with the BMW M 1000 RR, so overall a  good job by Michael. Tom got a good start but got a bit stuck in the  middle of the race really and couldn’t improve his lap time. He got  passed by a few riders but still commendable to finish ninth. So,  overall, we leave Most frustrated on Friday, not so bad on Saturday  and a lot happier Sunday.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I  think the at the end of the weekend it was not too bad. Especially  this morning in the Superpole race I had such good pace, I improved  over a second compared to yesterday and I was really happy on the  bike. Unfortunately, I didn’t get a good start, I was a bit unlucky at  T1 and couldn’t gain as many positions as I hoped so for race two I  had to start from 17th again. The first run off the line was good and  then the bike started to wheelie so we lost a little bit of time.  Something happened at T1, but I was quite smart and took a tight line  and avoided a lot of people. After that we had good pace and I was  catching the guys in front one by one but I just couldn’t get by  Rinaldi. Together we passed some people and in the end I tried to grab  sixth or fifth. Overall, I think after all the struggles this weekend  the team deserved a solid result.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It is what it  is, I’m not entirely happy. In the sprint race I was able to maintain  ten laps but in the second race I was struggling to just finish off  the turn in the latter stages. There is still work to be done. We made  a couple of small changes but we can’t do what our competitors are  doing in the last eight laps. We have learnt a lot this weekend and  certainly I’ve been close to several bikes, so I know where we are  strong and where we need to work on. Overall, it was not the best  weekend but there were some positives in Superpole and in the sprint  race, so now for the longer race we can look to improve that package  and keep working.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Today’s race was  the best of the weekend, even if it was not quite as successful as I  had envisaged. I had difficulties setting fast lap times this weekend,  and am still having issues with various areas of the bike. We will  keep working hard, comparing the data with that of Tom and Michael,  and hope to take the next step forward. My goal is to consistently  finish in the points.” \n"}
{"prompt":"Saturday in the Czech city of Most began with a strong Superpole result for BMW Motorrad Motorsport but ended with a disappointing race result. The FIM Superbike World Championship is making its first appearance at Most, where it is staging round six of the 2021 season. ->","completion":" Most. Saturday in the Czech city of Most began with a strong    Superpole result for BMW Motorrad Motorsport but ended with a    disappointing race result. The FIM Superbike World Championship is    making its first appearance at Most, where it is staging round six    of the 2021 season. In Superpole, Tom Sykes (GBR) of the BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team finished fourth on his BMW M 1000 RR,    narrowly missing out on the front row of the grid. He then came home    ninth in race one. Sykes’ team-mate Michael van der Mark (NED) made    an impressive fightback in the race before crashing out. Jonas    Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing team retired with a    technical issue. Sykes came up just 0.015 seconds short of a place on the front row of  the grid in Saturday morning’s Superpole qualifying. However, fourth  place also put him in a good position going into the race. Van der  Mark had to settle for 17th place in Superpole. Folger, who had  crashed in the morning’s third free practice session, qualified 21st. Sykes climbed into third place at the start of race one. However, he  went wide in turn one while having to avoid other riders and slotted  back into fifth place. On lap five, he again headed straight on in  turn one when he was touched by another bike. Finding himself in tenth  place, Sykes attempted to work his way back to the front of the field,  but then had issues with the rear tyre. He ultimately crossed the  finish line in ninth place. Starting from 17th on the grid, van der Mark launched a spirited  comeback on his M RR. However, having climbed into eighth place, that  comeback came to an abrupt end. The Dutchman was one of several riders  who crashed out of Saturday’s race. Folger had been continuously  moving up the field towards a points finish until a technical issue  forced him to retire on lap seven. Quotes after race one at Most. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  outcome of the race has been disappointing. In Superpole, Tom gave a  strong performance, he was right up there, and his race simulations  looked good in practice. During the race, he had to abort at T1 twice  going straight on, so he lost several positions throughout. Mickey had  a very disappointing qualifying but, in the race, made up in the early  stages as he usually does. He had good pace during the race and was  catching the P6, P7 group in front of him which would have been a good  result to come home with, but he unfortunately crashed. So we take the  positive point from today that the pace from Michael was there, but if  you don’t bring it home you get no points, so it was disappointing  overall. Jonas unfortunately retired due to an engine failure, so we  have to look into the cause. Now we hope for a better day tomorrow.”  Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We always aim for the first two rows as it’s a great  position to be in and Tom did just that in Superpole. In the race, Tom  got pushed wide going into the first corner and reacted quickly not to  lose many positions and time. The SC0 was the tyre of choice for the  race and he got into a pretty lonely battle at the end of the day so  he will equally be disappointed to finish 26 seconds off the win.  Michael had a difficult qualifying session but come the race he did  true Michael van der Mark style to battle and come through into a good  position. He was doing lap times in that race he hasn’t found all  weekend, so I am more pleased he was able to find that comfortable  feeling and his confidence ahead of tomorrow. Unfortunately, he  crashed at T20 which is easy to do with the temperatures increasing.  But we are not totally disappointed, we will come back stronger  tomorrow as we gained a lot of information.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The  qualifying result for sure was nice. When we put the Q tyre into the  BMW M 1000 RR, I am able to ride the bike much more naturally, and the  bike does things much better. But unfortunately for the race there was  a mix of tyres. We went down the safer route and this certainly did  not help us. After the start, going into T1 I was in there and I’ve  been happy with my braking all weekend, but the guys had stopped, and  I didn’t want to collect anyone, so I took the option to spoil my  first lap. Then the second time somebody was up the inside of me and  touched my handlebar, so I wasn’t able to make the turn. For tomorrow,  we will look to improve the set up, and we will revisit the tyre  choice. Overall, I am a little bit disappointed, also disappointed  with the final race result but we have learnt a lot today. Tomorrow we  will get two more chances.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was a really disappointing day, to be honest. In Superpole, I had bad  traffic on both outings on the Q tyre, which was such bad luck. It’s a  shame as I felt we could really make a step forward, so it was not  easy starting from P17 on the grid. Anyway, in the race I got a good  start and had good pace. I was fighting my way towards the front and  was feeling good with the bike but unfortunately when I was sat in P8  I lost the front going into T20. I was trying hard so it’s a shame  because we lost some valuable points. It was a difficult day overall,  but we can be happy with the pace we had in race one.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I was quick in  yesterday’s first free practice session, but unfortunately I then had  a crash in practice this morning. The mechanics managed to get the  bike ready just in time for qualifying. As a result, I only rode two  laps before we went into Superpole. That was probably why I didn’t  manage a good time. In the race, I noticed when changing gear that  there was a problem with the engine, which unfortunately then failed.  It was a tough day.” \n"}

When it comes to maintaining  production systems, the solution of choice at the BMW Group is to use  sensors, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). So rather  than the previous approach of rule-based maintenance at regular  intervals, predictive maintenance is carried out, based on the current  condition of the system. This not only prevents unscheduled downtimes  in production but also makes an important contribution to  sustainability and the efficient use of resources by ensuring optimum  system availability. Innovative, cloud-based predictive maintenance  solutions are currently being rolled out across the global production network.Predictive maintenance as an early warning system in production.The increasing digitalisation of maintenance has made a predictive  approach more and more important. By monitoring equipment and status  data, predictive maintenance can forecast system failures before they  actually happen. To optimise the upkeep of systems, data is used to  decide when to replace components as a precaution so as to prevent  unnecessary downtimes. Predictive maintenance also enhances efficiency  and sustainability by ensuring intact components are not exchanged too early.Forecasting states via a cloud-based platform.Predictive maintenance uses a cutting-edge cloud platform to obtain  early warnings about potential production downtimes. The data comes  directly from the manufacturing systems themselves, which are  connected to the cloud only once, via a gateway, for monitoring, and  then constantly transmit data – usually once a second. Individual  software modules within the platform can be switched on and off  flexibly, as needed, to accommodate changing requirements immediately.  And with a high degree of standardisation between its individual  components, the system is globally accessible, highly scalable and  allows new application scenarios to be implemented easily and existing  solutions to be rolled out fast. Predictive maintenance allows maintenance and repair processes to be  carried out as required by the actual condition of the system and  planned into already-scheduled production downtimes. Repairs can be  more accurately targeted and carried out more cost- and  resource-efficiently. In addition, extending running times prolongs  the service life of tools and systems significantly. The guiding  principle behind the provision of this solutions is: Developed once,  rolled out often – across the BMW Group production network.Diverse range of applications. The flexible, highly automated systems in mechanical drivetrain  production manufacture a conventional engine or casing for an electric  motor every minute. To keep these machines in good condition,  predictive maintenance uses simple statistical models – or predictive  AI algorithms, in more complex cases – to detect any anomalies. It  then issues visual warnings and alerts to inform employees that  maintenance is due.Over in the bodyshop, the welding guns perform about 15,000 spotwelds  each per day. To prevent potential downtimes, data from welding guns  around the world is collected by specially developed software. It is  then sent to the cloud to be collated and analysed with the help of  algorithms. All the data is displayed on a dashboard for worldwide use  to support the maintenance processes.In vehicle assembly, predictive maintenance helps prevent downtimes  in conveyors. At BMW Group Plant Regensburg, for example, the control  units of the conveyor systems work 24\/7 to send data on points such as  electrical currents, temperatures and locations to the cloud, where it  is constantly evaluated. The data specialists can then identify the  position, condition and activities of every conveyor element at any  given time. Predictive AI models use the data to detect any anomalies  and locate technical problems.\n"}
{"prompt":"BMW Motorrad Motorsport is once again entering new territory with the FIM Superbike World Championship. This weekend (6th to 8th August), WorldSBK races in the Czech city of Most for the first time. ->","completion":" Munich. BMW Motorrad Motorsport is once again entering new    territory with the FIM Superbike World Championship. This weekend    (6th to 8th August), WorldSBK races in the Czech city of Most for    the first time. Autodrom Most is unfamiliar terrain for the BMW    Motorrad WorldSBK Team and its two riders Tom Sykes (GBR) and    Michael van der Mark (NED), although Mark has ridden there many    years ago. Jonas Folger (GER) from the Bonovo MGM Racing Team has    more recent experience of the circuit. Autodrom Most is located in the northwest of the Czech Republic, not  far from the border with Germany. The Most region has hosted  motorsport events for over 70 years – first on street circuits, before  the permanent racetrack opened in 1983. Since then, races in national  and international championships have been held there. Most features on  the WorldSBK calendar for the first time in 2021. Quotes ahead of the Most round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Most  is a new circuit on the calendar. For this reason, it is very  important to immediately find a good basis in the two free practice  sessions on Friday. Jonas Folger has been there often, and our  colleagues in the International German Motorcycle Championship have  also ridden there. As such, we have some information, but it can never  be transferred directly to World Superbikes. In addition, it had been  agreed that no one goes testing there with their Superbikes so we are  all entering uncharted territory. We will see what awaits us there.  Recent events have shown that you have to land on the front two rows  in Saturday’s Superpole to have a successful race weekend. That is one  of the goals for the weekend.”  Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “The team is looking forward to going to the first WorldSBK  round at the Most circuit. That's exciting for everybody and very much  a level playing field with all the competitors and teams agreeing in  not take part in any testing leading up in the event. Overall, I think  it will be a very challenging circuit, lots of variations. Changeable  weather conditions are expected and we already know that we were  competitive in those environments. But overall, the team hopes that we  end up with a completely dry weekend to continue the development of  the BMW M 1000 RR. I think we are in a very good place, the riders are  feeling very good about the progression of the bike over the last  three, four races and we are looking forward to getting the event underway.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “I’ve been to Most, but that was 13 years ago. I watched an  on-board lap on YouTube and noticed that I have forgotten half of the  track, so it I think one can say that it’s like a new circuit for me.  So in the first couple of laps I will just try to learn the track and  find some markers, braking points and stuff like that. The last couple  of weekends, we saw that we were making progress. The gap to the  podium was getting smaller and smaller. So we now have to try and find  these last couple of tenths, especially on race pace, to be able to  fight for the podium. It is difficult to say what to expect for this  weekend on a new track but this is our goal, for sure.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am  obviously very much looking forward to the new venture. I have been to  the Czech Republic a number of times before but Most is a new circuit  for myself and I believe for most of the WorldSBK paddock. This is  going to be very interesting and hopefully now with our base set-up of  the new BMW M 1000 RR we can have a strong start to the weekend and  look to build on this in preparation for the races even if we only  have a small amount of time on Friday to do so. The weekend will be a  kind of an unpredictable one in terms of results because most of the  teams are going there with zero information. I am looking forward to  this new challenge.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I am really looking  forward to Most after the race weekend in Assen was such a positive  one – apart from the crash. We had really good pace there. We are now  looking to continue at Most where we left off at Assen. The circuit is  not far from me, so I can virtually call it a home race. I hope a lot  of German fans make the trip. I am looking forward to WorldSBK’s debut  at Most. I can hardly wait.”  Track Facts Most*.Circuit        length4.212          km – clockwiseCorners21 – 14 right-handers, 7 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight720          metres (start-finish straight)Grip levelComparatively highTrack        layoutVery          few straights, apart from start\/finish; mainly slow corners, chicanesStrain on        brakesMediumAmount at full        throttle23          % resp. 22 secondsTop speed \/ lowest        speed280          km\/h \/ 50 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityT1Key        factorsDynamic changes in direction, lots of          confidence in the front wheel *Information from the International German Motorcycle Championship  (IDM) – no data for WorldSBK available yet. \n"}

Both cars retired during the night. ->","completion":" Spa-Francorchamps. Walkenhorst Motorsport battled for the    podium with both BMW M6 GT3s at the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps    (BEL), but their strong performance went unrewarded. Both cars    retired during the night. The #35 BMW M6 GT3, with Martin Tomczyk,    Timo Glock (both GER) and Thomas Neubauer (FRA) at the wheel, was    damaged in a collision. The #34 BMW M6 GT3 suffered a technical    issue. That car was shared by Sheldon van der Linde (RSA), Marco    Wittmann (GER) and David Pittard (GBR). When night fell after the opening stage with periods of heavy rain,  the #35 was on track to the podium in third place. A collision  occurred shortly before midnight, however, while Tomczyk was lapping  another car and the left front suspension broke. After a repair break,  the #35 returned to the track but then had to retire. The #34, which  successfully fought its way back up the field after tyre damage early  on, was then in line for a podium finish, but Pittard was forced to  park the car at the edge of the track at around half past three in the  morning when the car lost drive. The #10 BMW M6 GT3 of Boutsen Ginion Racing, which contested the  Pro-Am Cup, crossed the finish line in 35th position. Jens Klingmann  (GER), Karim Ojjeh (KSA), Jens Liebhauser (GER) and Yann Zimmer (SUI)  took turns at the wheel of the car. Quotes from the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps: Niclas Königbauer (Team Manager Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “Obviously, it is a bitter disappointment. We  were up there fighting for the podium with both cars. The drivers and  the whole team were highly motivated, and we saw that we had the pace  in the race, but sometimes things work out differently than you hope.  The fact that two unfortunate situations meant we didn’t finish with  either car makes us very sad – particularly as it was the BMW M6 GT3’s  farewell race here at Spa-Francorchamps.” Sheldon van der Linde (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “It’s a very bitter pill to swallow after such a  strong start to the weekend. We were up there in every single session  and I honestly think we had all the ingredients to win this race but  unfortunately we had to retire the car early in the morning. It’s a  big shame, especially as both cars were out. It hurts twice as much  when you are in such a good position and know you have a strong  package and all you need to do is to bring it home. But Spa is such a  hard race to win, you need so much luck and you have so many different  factors involved that all need to fall into place and unfortunately  that wasn’t the case this year.” Marco Wittmann (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “Obviously, it is a disappointing outcome for  us, especially seeing as both cars retired. We had incredibly strong  pace and were in the position of being able to battle for the podium  or even the win. After tyre damage in the opening stage, we battled  our way back up through the field gradually, and I handed the car over  to David in third place. But then we had to retire. It’s really sad  because we had a strong car and wanted to commemorate the BMW M6 GT3  with a different result in its final 24-hour race at Spa. But that’s  motorsport for you.” David Pittard (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “I am obviously very disappointed for us in both  the #34 car and the #35 car. Walkenhorst Motorsport had prepared two  front-running cars but then unfortunately both had issues while  running in the top three. Unfortunately, that is endurance racing and  you always have to expect these things but it makes it all the more  painful when you are running so close to the front. A big thanks to  all the team for all their efforts to make the car so quick and put us  in such a competitive position. Unfortunately it wasn’t meant to be  this year for Walkenhorst Motorsport and BMW.” Martin Tomczyk (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “It’s a shame that both cars retired. Everything  was going really well for us in the #35, we had a strong pace, the car  was good and I was faster than the two leaders in my stint. I was  within reach of them but then the collision happened while overtaking.  That brought the 24-hour race to an end for us. It was a real shame,  but these are the kind of things that happen in motorsport, however  bitter they may be. Now we’re focussing on the next race, which will  hopefully turn out better.” Timo Glock (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst Motorsport):  “Both cars retiring was a real shame for the whole team. But that’s  24-hour races. Our car was really good, we were in the top three, had  a flawless race with strong stints, had no track limit warnings and  nothing. Before the accident we were at a very, very good level and  were in a really good position for getting a strong result. Martin and  Thomas drove fantastic stints, and I was also very pleased with mine.  I had good pace and worked the car up into the top three. I felt very  at ease in the car.” Thomas Neubauer (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “It was really heartbreaking to see both our  BMWs retiring from the race. We all had a really strong pace and  everyone, the drivers, Walkenhorst Motorsport and BMW did a great job  this weekend. That is why it’s even tougher to finish like this. But  we showed that we were fighting for the top positions, and now we just  need to keep our head high and move on to the next race. A big thank  you to Walkenhorst Motorsport and BMW for providing such an amazing  car. It was so much fun driving this car. It was not the way we wanted  to finish the last 24 hours of Spa for the BMW M6 GT3 but it is what  it is. Motorsport can be an amazing sport and very ruthless at the  same time.” \n"}

Everything is ready for the classic    endurance race in the Ardennes: Walkenhorst Motorsport secured a    promising starting position for the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps    (BEL) in Super Pole qualification on Friday evening. Sheldon van der    Linde (RSA) claimed fifth place in the #34 BMW M6 GT3, Thomas    Neubauer (FRA) finished the final qualifying session in the #35 BMW    M6 GT3 in 14th place. Van der Linde is sharing the cockpit in the #34 car with Marco  Wittmann (GER) and David Pittard (GBR). Neubauer will be driving the  #35 car with Martin Tomczyk and Timo Glock (both GER). The two BMW M6  GT3s put on a strong performance in Thursday’s multi-session  qualifying, which was red-flagged several times. The average of the  best times for the individual drivers in each car is calculated to  determine qualifying classification. The 20 fastest cars move on to  Super Pole. This posed no problem for Walkenhorst Motorsport, with  fifth place for the #34 car and #35 in sixth. On Friday afternoon, it was time for a different event, the FANATEC  Esports GT Pro Series race. This sim racing series is a central  element of the FANATEC GT World Challenge Europe powered by AWS, which  also includes the 24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps. Each team  nominates a driver who competes in the race on the Assetto Corsa  Competizione platform and can score points for the real overall  standings. Victory at Spa-Francorchamps went to BMW as Pittard won the  sim race for the Walkenhorst Motorsport team. Super Pole followed on Friday evening, a shootout with two flying  laps for each car. Rain began to fall just before the start of the  final qualifying session, but the conditions were still conducive to  driving on slicks. The two BMW M6 GT3s went out onto the track, one  after the other. Van der Linde recorded a fastest time of 2:18.590  minutes, which was enough to secure fifth on the grid for him and his  team-mates. Neubauer claimed 14th place, going round in 2:19.011 minutes. “That was a really good Super Pole for us and that makes me happy,”  said van der Linde. “We are also aware that qualifying is not decisive  at Spa, so I am confident about the race. I think that we’ve got a  good race car, which is what counts. But it was nice to be driving in  Super Pole for the first time. Thanks to the team for placing their  trust in me. Now I am hoping that we can record a great result.” “It is not easy to compete against the world’s fastest GT3 drivers in  Super Pole, and when you see a bit of rain as you are getting into the  car, things get a bit more tense. But we were still able to push on  dry tyres and the track conditions were good,” reported Neubauer. “Us  BMW drivers had a decent qualifying session, and especially Sheldon  did a mega job so congratulations to him. Our plan is now to make a  good start, then to keep our heads down and avoid making any mistakes.” The #10 BMW M6 GT3 car from Boutson Ginion Racing, competing in the  Pro-Am Cup, will be starting from 45th position. Jens Klingmann (GER),  Karim Ojjeh (KSA), Jens Liebhauser (GER) and Yann Zimmer (SUI) will be  sharing driving duties in this car. Right after Super Pole, BMW M Motorsport provided a glimpse of the  future as the new BMW M4 GT3 completed several demonstration laps of  the ‘Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps’. The new GT3 flagship, which will  be competing as of 2022, appeared with Glock at the wheel before  Klingmann took over. “It was so much fun driving the new BMW M4 GT3 here. Those were my  very first laps in this car, but I have to say that all the hard work  that has been put into this race car has really paid off,” explained  Glock later. “As soon as you get into the BMW M4 GT3, you feel good.  The driving position and the level of driving comfort are just as good  as everything else. The car feels very, very good right away and  delivers convincing driveability. The guys really did some outstanding  work. I am already looking forward to getting some more laps in with  the car, but that was a very positive start.” “Driving the first demo laps with the new BMW M4 GT3 was definitely  something special,” said Klingmann. “That gives you an idea of what  next year will be like, when we will hopefully be battling for overall  wins with that car. But I think that the demo laps were enough to  realise just how much potential the car has. I can now compare it  directly with the BMW M6 GT3, which I am also driving here this  weekend, and I think that the car gets a great reception in the  paddock. A lot of teams have already shown an interest, which shows  that BMW M Motorsport is on the right path with the BMW M4 GT3.” The 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps will start on Saturday, 31st July  at 16:30.\n"}
{"prompt":"BMW R 18 B and R 18 Transcontinental celebrate their debuts in The Cadillac Three’s new music video. ->","completion":" Munich. The new BMW R 18 B and R 18 Transcontinental  celebrate their world premieres like no other motorcycle before: they  are starring in the music video of well-knownBig Machine Records  act The Cadillac Three and their new song “Get After  It”. After various digital world premieres, this is another completely  new approach to show a new bike for the first time.The collaboration with the band from Nashville, Tennessee (USA)  came to life just natural. “One of the most exciting things about this  partnership is being able to combine awesome music and motorcycles. It  was a truly special experience to be the first person in the USA to  ride these new bikes for the first time,” says lap-steel guitarist  Kelby Ray, who is a passionate rider himself.The video production took place just outside of Nashville in  June with director Dylan Rucker leading the high-octane clip. “This  was such an awesome experience! While recording the track we tried to  incorporate the feeling of getting on that BMW Motorrad bike for the  first time while playing a really loud guitar through huge Marshall  stacks like we do out on the road. I think we nailed it,”  Singer-guitarist Jaren Johnston adds. And the third member of the  band, drummer Neil Mason, says: “We’ve had a great relationship with  Marshall Amplifiers for a long time and when we found out they’d  recommended us to BMW to help launch their new motorcycle with a music  video for “Get After It,” it felt like a big ole hell yes for us.”Riding a motorcycle while listening to music – both fit well  together, as they promise deep emotional experiences and intense  pleasure on two wheels. It is not for nothing that generations of  artists have dedicated their songs to the experience of motorcycling.“BMW Motorrad stands for the passion for riding, but it’s also  about meeting people and being part of the community,” says Ralf  Rodepeter, Head of Marketing and Product Management BMW Motorrad.  “Both music and riding a motorcycle are just about pure emotion. I  can’t think of a better song than this awesome track from The Cadillac  Three for this project.” To ensure that beats and basses perfectly  complement the ear while riding, BMW Motorrad has long been engaged in  intensive development work on its sound systems. With its now agreed  long-term partnership with world-renowned British company Marshall  Amplification, the innovation and quality of BMW Motorrad sound  systems are set to reach new heights.With the Marshall sound system, the new R 18 Transcontinental  and R 18 B offer an intense sound experience. Already as standard both  bikes feature a sound system developed in collaboration with the  British manufacturer Marshall, featuring 2-way speakers integrated  into the front of the fairing. Black speaker grilles with white  Marshall lettering round off the classic look. The Marshall Gold  Series Stage 1 and Stage 2 sound systems are optionally ex works to  provide even more intensive listening pleasure. Up to 4 loudspeakers  and 2 subwoofers with 280 watts of total output provide incomparable  sound quality and \"good vibrations\".For 60 years, Marshall, originally from Hanwell, London, now  based in Bletchley, Milton Keynes (UK), have produced legendary guitar  amplifiers used by the world’s best musicians. Since 2012 they have  expanded their audio quality into award winning headphones and active  speakers designed for music lovers.“The legendary Marshall spirit and the development power of BMW  Motorrad just fit perfectly together. It’s the perfect match,” says  Alex Coombes, Commercial Director Marshall. “We’re already looking  forward of much more to come”.With the new R 18 Transcontinental, BMW Motorrad is adding a  Grand American Tourer to the R 18 family as well as the R 18 B  \"Bagger\", which is particularly popular in the USA. As with  the previous R 18 models, the new R 18 Transcontinental and R 18 B  combine the thrilling power of the \"Big Boxer\" with a  classic chassis concept based on historical models, exclusive  equipment and a stylish design.The two new members of the R 18 family will be presented on 6  August in Sturgis, South Dakota, USA for the first time to the public.

Sights set on overall victory, whilst looking ahead to    the future: BMW M Motorsport is focussing on two main sporting    priorities at the highlight of this season’s FANATEC GT World    Challenge Europe, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). In the    race, Walkenhorst Motorsport, armed with the BMW M6 GT3 and a host    of BMW works drivers, will be out to claim the team’s second overall    victory, having previously won in 2018. The new BMW M4 GT3 will    complete a number of demo laps after Superpole on Friday. Not only    will the car be presented, but also the hybrid steering wheel,    developed in collaboration with FANATEC. The flood disaster in    Germany and Belgium is another important topic. Among other things,    the BMW Group is donating 1.5 million euros to support the rescue    services in the disaster areas. As an expression of sympathy, the    BMW race cars at Spa-Francorchamps will bear the message ‘We stand together’. As in the races already completed in this season’s Endurance Cup – at  Monza (ITA) and Le Castellet (FRA) – Marco Wittmann (GER), Sheldon van  der Linde (RSA) and David Pittard (GBR) will compete in the #34 BMW M6  GT3 for Walkenhorst Motorsport. Timo Glock, Martin Tomczyk (both GER)  and Thomas Neubauer (FRA) will share the wheel of the #35 car. Both  crews recently finished in the top ten in the 1000 km of Paul Ricard.  The team receives support from BMW M Motorsport partners Akrapovič,  BMW M Performance Parts, CATL, MultiBank Group, and Shell with the  running of both cars. Spa-Francorchamps was the scene of Walkenhorst Motorsport’s greatest  success so far. The team from Melle (GER) took overall victory in  2018. Three years prior to that, Glock was among those who caused  quite a stir when he shared the driving duties in a BMW Z4 GT3,  sporting a Michel Vaillant look, with Bruno Spengler (CAN) and BMW  brand ambassador Alessandro Zanardi (ITA). Thanks to BMW M Motorsport  Team Boutsen Ginion Racing, this year’s starting grid will again  feature a BMW car with a Michel Vaillant design. In the Pro-Am Cup,  BMW works driver Jens Klingmann (GER) races alongside Karim Ojjeh  (KSA), Jens Liebhauser (GER) and Yann Zimmer (SUI) in the #10 BMW M6 GT3. Glock and Klingmann will play a main role in a joint show event, put  on by BMW M Motorsport and series partner FANATEC after Friday  evening’s Superpole. The two BMW works drivers will complete a number  of demo laps in the new BMW M4 GT3, during which they will demonstrate  the globally unique feature of the steering wheel. It was designed to  be used in both a real race car and a race simulator. To showcase  this, Glock and Klingmann will use the identical steering wheel in  both the car’s cockpit and a simulator. The BMW M4 GT3, which caused people to sit up and take notice a few  weeks ago with the best time at the official tests at  Spa-Francorchamps, will be on display in the paddock all weekend. From  2022, the BMW M Motorsport teams will do battle for victories and  titles around the world with the new GT flagship. Quotes ahead of the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps: Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “This 24-hour  race is particularly poignant given the catastrophic flooding we have  experienced, some of which has been very close to the Nürburgring and  Spa-Francorchamps racetracks which we all love so much. Our thoughts  are with all those suffering as a result of the floods. From a  sporting point of view, our goal is to bid farewell to the BMW M6 GT3  by adding another success to the outstanding record it has enjoyed at  Spa-Francorchamps in the past. The car took overall victory in 2016  and 2018, and I am confident that Walkenhorst Motorsport can play a  major role again this year. Furthermore, we are heralding the era of  the new BMW M4 GT3 with a number of demonstration laps. It gave an  indication of what sort of speed it is capable of a few weeks ago, at  the official tests, even if that was without any opposition and in a  classification of its own. We are looking forward to a varied weekend.” Niclas Königbauer (Team Manager Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “This weekend, we return to the scene of the  Walkenhorst Motorsport team’s greatest success to date. We know that  the BMW M6 GT3 is strong at this circuit, and want to mix it at the  front of the field again in the car’s final race at Spa-Francorchamps.  We have fantastic drivers, who are definitely capable of challenging  for the podium, and hopefully even the win.” Sheldon van der Linde (#34 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “I’m really looking forward to racing at Spa  together with Marco Wittmann and David Pittard and trying to win again  for Walkenhorst Motorsport, who have shown before how strong the team  and the BMW M6 GT3 are on that track. I think it would be the perfect  farewell for the car in its last year. We had strong pace in the last  race at Le Castellet but couldn’t bring it home so we have some  unfinished business. I would love to win this race, after having  finished third there in 2018 – behind two BMW M6 GT3s…” Timo Glock (#35 BMW M6 GT3, Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “I am really looking forward to driving in the  24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps again, having appeared alongside  Alex Zanardi and Bruno Spengler last time out at this event.  Unfortunately, on that occasion we only managed 23.5 hours instead of  24. As such, our goal for this year is obviously to finish the race –  and, if possible, in a good position. It is a very special race. The  circuit is simply outstanding, and Spa-Francorchamps always guarantees  good racing. For this reason, I am looking forward to taking on the  race together with Martin Tomczyk, Thomas Neubauer and Walkenhorst  Motorsport. I am excited to see how it plays out, and am looking  forward to the challenge of the 24 Hours of Spa.” Jens Klingmann (#10 BMW M6 GT3, Boutsen Ginion  Racing): “For me, the 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps is the  biggest GT3 race in the world, with more than 60 cars in the starting  line-up. Together with Boutsen Ginion Racing and my fellow drivers in  the Pro-Am class, I will be striving to finish for the family, even if  the class is a very strong one. I am also really looking forward to  the show run in the BMW M4 GT3. It is a great honour to present the  car to the fans and the other teams on this occasion.”\n"}

And I have a good reason for being confident  that we can achieve this enormous transformation: namely, our  employees,” noted Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management  of BMW AG responsible for Human Resources and an OYW Counsellor, at  the big closing ceremony on Sunday at BMW Welt. “The reason for my  optimism is employees like Evelin Hartmann and Florian Kantop,”  Horstmeier added. The two talented young people from the MINI design  team and the seat development department set themselves the goal of  finding a sustainable and recyclable alternative to leather seat  covers. With the help of their colleagues, they developed a design  concept for a 100 percent recyclable seat cover that produces over 99  percent less CO2 emissions than conventional leather covers. “Along  with seats, our teams are also taking a closer look at vehicle  components such as the floor trim, trunk and headliner. There is  plenty of potential there!” promised the two when presenting their  project on the OYW stage at BMW Welt. The BMW Group’s other OYW delegates have likewise recognised this  potential – and, in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable  Development Goals, are also helping to make the world a little better  through their projects. They collect and recycle PVC scraps from  manufacturing, make backpacks and toilet bags from old factory  uniforms, and support schools in South Africa with solar energy  storage units made from used high-voltage batteries. “It’s up to us to take responsibility”“It’s up to us to take responsibility,” says Ilka Horstmeier.  Thinking hard about the future and actively shaping it today is thus  not only the guiding principle of the OYW organisation but is also  strongly anchored in the consciousness of the BMW Group.  Far-sightedness and social responsibility can even be called hallmarks  of the BMW Group. This also includes offering committed young  professionals a platform for complex and constructive discussions  about solutions for the future. “We must strive to develop a common  image of our society – as a people-centred society that balances  solutions to environmental and social problems with economic  progress,” according to Horstmeier. The four-day One Young World Summit is held in a different city each  year. The host city in 2022 will be Tokyo. Please contact us if you have any queries:Corporate CommunicationsAngela Konert, BMW Group, Spokesperson Human ResourcesPhone: +49-89-382-50591, angela.konert@bmw.deMarkus Sagemann, BMW Group, Head of Communications Human Resources,  Corporate CitizenshipPhone: +49-89-382-68796, markus.sagemann@bmw.de The BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

{"prompt":"BMW M Motorsport teams are once again in action all over the world in 2021. They are challenging for race wins and titles with the BMW M6 GT3, the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW M2 CS Racing, and other BMW M Motorsport race cars. Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you an overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. ->","completion":" DTM: Pole position for the BMW M6 GT3 at the Lausitzring. Round two of the season in the new DTM: This weekend, the Lausitzring  (GER) hosted the GT3 series in glorious summery conditions. Sheldon  van der Linde (RSA) secured the first pole position in the DTM for the  BMW M6 GT3. The ROWE Racing driver set the fastest time in qualifying  on Saturday morning. Van der Linde then led for much of Saturday’s  race in the #31 BMW M6 GT3, before eventually finishing third.  However, he was subsequently handed a time penalty for a moment of  carelessness from the pit crew, which saw him relegated to ninth  place. The best-placed BMW M6 GT3 on Saturday was the #11 Walkenhorst  Motorsport car, driven by Marco Wittmann (GER), who came home seventh.  Wittmann climbed seven positions from 14th on the grid. Timo Glock  (GER) struggled with tyre wear before finishing eleventh in the #16  ROWE Racing BMW M6 GT3. Glock was then the best-placed BMW driver in Sunday’s qualifying,  securing fifth place on the grid. Van der Linde started the race from  seventh place, with Wittmann again 14th. In race two on Sunday, van  der Linde came home fifth, just ahead of Wittmann who produced another  impressive fightback to finish sixth. Glock twice ended up in the  gravel during a hectic start to the race, and fell well back down the  field as a result. He eventually crossed the finish line in 13th place. The third race weekend of the 2021 season will take place at Zolder,  Belgium, from 6th to 8th August. --DTM Trophy: Three podiums for the BMW M4 GT4 in Lusatia. There was another strong display from the BMW M Motorsport teams at  the second event of this season’s DTM Trophy at the Lausitzring (GER).  Seven BMW M4 GT4s finished in the top ten in Saturdays race, with that  figure rising to eight on Sunday. Spearheading the BMW contingent was  Ben Green (GBR) in the #10 BMW M4 GT4, who was runner-up in both races  for the FK Performance Motorsport team. In race two on Sunday, Green  was joined on the podium by Michael Schrey (GER) in the #2 BMW M4 GT4  of Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport. Green, who had started the season with a victory in the opening race  at Monza (ITA) back in June, was once again in contention for the top  step of the podium in both races. In race one, he missed out on the  win by less than half a second, crossing the finish line in second  place. Race two was even closer. Green led at times before eventually  finishing just three-tenths of a second behind the winning car. In the  championship standings, Green is currently second after four races.  Schrey, who won race two of the season at Monza and added another  podium at the Lausitzring, is third in the Drivers’ Championship. In  the Team competition, FK Performance Motorsport is currently second,  ahead of Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport. --BMW M2 Cup: New racing series makes its debut at the Lausitzring. The new BMW M2 Cup made its debut during the DTM weekend at the  Lausitzring (GER). The new series features spectacular racing with the  BMW M2 CS Racing. 17 cars were in action at the season-opener in the  Lusatia region of Germany. The dominant driver on the inaugural weekend of the BMW M2 Cup was  Tim Heinemann (GER), who secured both pole positions in the #78 BMW M2  CS Racing and went on to claim comfortable lights-to-flag victories in  both races. In Saturday’s opening race, Heinemann finished almost nine  seconds ahead of his closest rivals. In race two on Sunday, his lead  was over four seconds. Runner-up in race one was Fabian Kreim (GER \/  #43). In race two, second place went to 16-year-old Salman Owega (GER  \/ #7). The third place on the podium in both races was occupied by  Louis Henkefend (GER) in the #17 BMW M2 CS Racing. The second event of the season takes place from 6th to 8th August at  Zolder, Belgium. More information on the BMW M2 Cup can be found on  the official website bmwm2cup.com. Image and  video material is also available for download here in the ‘Media’ section. --IMSA: Eventful race weekend at Lime Rock Park. The second half of this season’s IMSA series got underway at Lime  Rock Park (USA) in mid-July. The competitors in the IMSA WeatherTech  Championship and the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge had an eventful  race weekend at times. On Friday, unsettled weather presented a real  challenge for the teams. In GTD qualifying in the IMSA WeatherTech  Championship, the #96 Turner Motorsport BMW M6 GT3 finished seventh.  The only way was up for drivers Bill Auberlen and Robby Foley (both  USA) in the Saturday race, which was scheduled to last two hours and  40 minutes. However, an intense thunderstorm forced the race to be  suspended after 90 minutes, and it was never re-started. That left  Auberlen\/Foley in fifth place. They currently lie second in the  Drivers’ Championship. Friday’s qualifying for the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge was  shortened following a crash. Auberlen qualified second in the #95  Turner Motorsport BMW M4 GT4, which he shares with Dillon Machavern  (USA). In the two-hour race on Saturday, a technical issue resulted in  the duo dropping well down the field. They eventually finished 16th in  the GS class. Foley and Vincent Barletta (USA) were eighth in class in  the #96 BMW M4 GT4. The AutoTechnic Racing team competed with the #52  BMW M4 GT4, driven by Attilio Albani and Elivan Goulart (both USA).  They came home eleventh in the GS class. Auberlen and Machavern  continue to lead the GS standings, but are now tied at the top of the standings. --British GT Championship: Leaders Century Motorsport on the    podium at Spa-Francorchamps. The British GT Championship was in Belgium at the weekend, where  Spa-Francorchamps hosted round four of the 2021 season. It was another  successful weekend for the Century Motorsport team – despite the  additional weight the team had to bear as a result of its brace of  victories at round three at Donington (GBR). Gus Burton and Will Burns  (both GBR) in the #57 BMW M4 GT4 secured pole position in a  hard-fought qualifying session on Saturday. The two-hour race on  Sunday was an eventful one. In the end, Burton\/Mills finished third  overall in the GT4 class and second in the Silver class. Their  team-mates Andrew Gordon-Coldbrooke and Chris Salkeld (both GBR) gave  a courageous fightback in the #9 BMW M4 GT4. Having dropped through  the field following a drive-through penalty, they recovered strongly  to finish fifth overall and fourth in the Silver class.    In the GT4 Drivers’ standings in the British GT Championship, Burton  and Burns still hold a commanding lead with 111.5 points. They are  followed in second place by Gordon-Coldbrooke and Salkeld with 81  points. Burton\/Burns also lead the Silver class, with  Gordon-Coldbrooke\/Salkeld the top pair in the Pro-Am competition. In  the GT4 Team standings, Century Motorsport are top with 196.5 points  and a seemingly-unassailable lead of 132 points. --Super GT Championship: Round four at Motegi. The Japanese Super GT Championship held its fourth round of the  season at Motegi (JPN) in mid-July. In the thick of the action was BMW  Team Studie with the #7 BMW M6 GT3, driven by Seiji Ara and Tomohide  Yamaguchi (both JPN). The summery heat, with temperatures reaching 33  degrees Celsius, made for challenging conditions. In Saturday’s  qualifying, the #7 was the fastest Pro-Am car and finished 13th  overall. However, the team then had to retire from Sunday’s race due  to a technical issue.\n"}

BMW Art Journey winner 2021  Julien Creuzet, represented by High Art, Paris, started the first part  of his BMW Art Journey on July 15, 2021. In Martinique, he will  explore the unexpected and surprising in the familiar environment of  his ancestors.The BMW Art Journey is part of BMW Group’s global cultural  engagement, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.  Committed in the fields of modern and contemporary art, classical  music, jazz and sound as well as architecture and design, the BMW  Group has been an integral part of culture on a global scale.Inspired by the Martinican thinker, critic and poet Édouard Glissant  who had written about the concept of creolization, “It is a mixture of  arts, customs and languages ​​that produces the unexpected,” Creuzet  will make five trips in total to the Antillean islands Martinique and  Guadeloupe between July 2021 and Spring 2022.Creuzet himself was raised in Martinique, but never had the chance to  work there. About his BMW Art Journey he says: “I strive to make my  contribution, to give back by offering my experience and a place, a  living world, a workstation for long-term experimentation. My journey  is related to a long-time project that I had in mind, but I was never  able to realize it. It is a good opportunity for me to return and to  re-connect with my native land. I have shown and shared my practice  and perspective around the world, but never in the land of my ancestors.”During his BMW Art Journey Julien Creuzet will focus on three  artistic projects around the geographically and culturally distinct  region of the Antilleans. Filming landscapes, underwater scenes, and  local festivals such as carnival, on the ground and with drones, he  will create a video in collaboration with local contemporary artists  and musicians.A second project is an eight months-long workshop with the art  students of Beaux-Arts de Fort-de-France (Campus Caribbean des Arts),  opening a studio for their artistic work. One focus of the workshop  will be about the creation of “bwadjacks” – sculptures made of  modified cars and materials which are usually found on scrapyards, in  a gesture of circularity.Lastly, Creuzet will work on a project with the local fauna of the  Antilleans. Drawing inspiration from natural forms, he aims to create  new hybrid sculptures recycling plastic and other materials. The  results of his BMW Art Journey are expected to be shown during Art  Basel in Hong Kong in 2022.About Julien Creuzet at High Art, ParisJulien  Creuzet (b.1986) lives and works in Montreuil, France. He creates  protean artworks incorporating poetry, music, sculpture, assemblage,  film and animation. Evoking trans-oceanic postcolonial transactions in  relation to multiple temporalities, the artist places his own  inherited past, present and future at the heart of his production.  Eluding generalized narratives and cultural reductions, Creuzet’s work  often spotlights anachronisms and social realities to construct  objects of irreducibility. Recent solo exhibitions include Camden Arts  Center, London (upcoming); Palais de Tokyo and Fondation d'entreprise  Pernod Ricard, Paris. His work was featured in group exhibitions at  Manifesta 13, Marseilles; Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt; Musée  d’Art moderne de Paris and Centre Pompidou, Paris. Creuzet is a  nominee for the Prix Marcel Duchamp 2021.Julien Creuzet was selected for BMW Art Journey 2021 from a shortlist  of three artists represented by galleries originally accepted into  this year’s Art Basel show in Hong Kong, in an online jury process.  The international jury of experts included Claire  Hsu, Executive Director, Asia    Art Archive, Hong Kong; Matthias Mühling,  Director, Städtische Galerie    im Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau, Munich; Patrizia Sandretto    Re Rebaudengo, President, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo,  Turin; Philip Tinari, Director, UCCA Center for Contemporary Art,  Beijing; and Samson Young, artist and winner of the  first BMW Art Journey. About the BMW Art JourneyLaunched in 2015, the    BMW Art Journey is a collaboration between Art  Basel and BMW, created to recognize and support emerging artists  worldwide. Since 2020, the circle of eligible artists has broadened  and includes not only emerging and mid-career artists from the  Discoveries sector, but also artists represented by galleries founded  no more than ten years ago at Art Basel’s show in Hong Kong.

{"prompt":" Innovative design concepts for city-centre travel  Electrified bicycle Concept DYNAMIC CARGO promises high variability, everyday usability and sheer cycling pleasure  e-scooter Concept CLEVER COMMUTE with remarkably compact de-sign thanks to folding mechanism   ->","completion":" Munich. In recent years, there has been an increase  in traffic in many city centres, and the mobility requirements of the  people who live there remain high. In its role as a premium provider  for individual mobility, the BMW Group is actively helping to create  the liveable city of the future. Here, its approach to mobility also  looks beyond the company’s core business. The BMW Group has already  presented a number of innovative micromobility solutions to the public  in the past, including the BMW Motorrad X2City, the Personal Mover Concept and the BMW Vision E³ Way elevated road concept. With  the unveiling of the electrified bicycle Concept DYNAMIC CARGO and the  e-scooter Concept CLEVER COMMUTE, the BMW Group engineers are once  again demonstrating their unrivalled ability to transfer know-how from  the automotive sector to concepts for micromobility vehicles.Concept DYNAMIC CARGO: unexpected cycling pleasure plus    exceptional variability.Bicycles offer great flexibility of use, produce zero emissions and  are one of the fastest and most efficient means of transport in urban  areas. However, rainy, cold or slippery conditions are usually all it  takes for the majority of cyclists to switch to public transport or  their car instead. The same applies when they need to carry loads that  are too large for a standard luggage rack to handle, such as a larger  food shop, or to transport children. A wide range of cargo bikes are  now available that offer an additional alternative to using the car  for urban trips. However, many cargo bike concepts are wider and,  above all, longer than normal bicycles due to the requirements for  transporting loads and\/or children. In conjunction with the resulting  additional weight and the possible payload, this leads to restrictions  of varying degrees compared to normal bicycles, particularly with  regard to driving agility and handling.\"Our goal was to develop a concept that retains the agility and  driving feel of a normal bicycle while adding innovative, safe  transport options\" says Jochen Karg, Head of Vehicle Concepts in  the BMW Group's New Technologies and China division. \"The  \"Concept DYNAMIC CARGO\" is the first dynamic 'pick-up' cargo  bike that combines driving pleasure with flexible use and increased  year-round suitability.\"The key component of the three-wheeled Concept DYNAMIC CARGO is the  front main frame, which is connected to the rear section via a pivot  axle and tilts in corners. The rear section remains stable through all  corners without tilting towards the road. This combines with the  electrified powertrain – which is activated as soon as the rider  starts to pedal and drives the two rear wheels – to make the cargo  bike just as easy to ride as a standard bicycle. As well as producing  far greater riding stability in all weather conditions compared to  two-wheeler designs, the rear wheels with their rigid, non-pivoting  axle mounting also provide the basis for a versatile, pick-up-style  transport platform. This can be fitted with a selection of innovative  modular attachments for carrying luggage and\/or children. The modular  design principle paves the way for many more use cases, too. The  non-pivoting design of the transport platform has the additional  benefit that the rider is barely aware of any extra weight being  carried, enabling safe, stable transportation of all loads while also  ensuring a pleasurable riding experience.The concept is rounded off by a facility for adding a modular system  of weather protection. Together with the superior riding safety, which  proves especially useful in adverse weather, this makes the Concept  DYNAMIC CARGO an attractive means of transport all year round.Although the BMW Group will not manufacture the Concept DYNAMIC CARGO  itself, it is already in discussions with potential licensees.Concept CLEVER COMMUTE: the perfect companion for the “last mile”.E-scooters have firmly established themselves in the urban mobility  mix, thanks to sharing schemes in particular. They offer flexible  usability, zero local emissions and the ability to get city dwellers  to their destination extremely quickly over short “last-mile” urban  journeys. The uptake of e-scooters for private ownership has been  relatively slow to date. Robust models that can be ridden safely are  difficult to take onto public transport or carry by car due to their  size, while small, more portable models suffer from poor riding stability.With its Concept CLEVER COMMUTE, the BMW Group is now presenting an  e-scooter that folds easily for carrying on public transport and\/or by  car without compromising on riding stability in any way. In public  transport mode, the footboard folds up at the sides and the rear wheel  pivots into the resulting aperture from below. This mechanism shortens  the wheelbase of the CLEVER COMMUTE substantially so that it can even  be carried on an escalator without difficulty. This is an important  requirement if the journey includes underground transport routes. It  can also be rolled along on both wheels in this mode, rather like a  trolley case. And the front wheel’s integral hub motor provides an  electric impulse that makes it easier to push the CLEVER COMMUTE up  ramps. The e-scooter’s compact dimensions when folded up means it  should be possible to take it on all forms of public transport free of charge.The CLEVER COMMUTE can be folded up to a size that fits easily into  small vehicle boots, with larger boots able to accommodate several of  them for family outings. In the BMW Group range, this means that the  CLEVER COMMUTE fits into luggage compartments lengthways from the  3 Series upwards, for example, without any need to fold down the rear  backrest, and it can be carried crossways in MINI boots.With its unique product characteristics, the CLEVER COMMUTE is a  versatile companion in the city and allows any journey to be completed  quickly, safely and easily. Its transformability makes it a truly  ideal solution for multimodal travel.Although the BMW Group will not manufacture the Concept CLEVER  COMMUTE itself, it is already in discussions with potential licensees.Both micromobility concepts have been designed in such a way that the  electric range can be scaled with regard to the respective  application. One final very important feature for city use is the  battery pack, which can be removed and charged at home.\n"}
{"prompt":"In a tumultuous Sunday race, Maximilian Günther (GER) and Jake Dennis (GBR) scored valuable points in the overall ABB FIA Formula E World Championship standings.  ->","completion":" London. In a tumultuous Sunday race, Maximilian Günther (GER)    and Jake Dennis (GBR) scored valuable points in the overall ABB FIA    Formula E World Championship standings. Günther had started the 13th    race of the season from sixth on the grid and crossed the line in    the same position. Dennis followed up his win at the London E-Prix    (GBR) on Saturday with a courageous recovery performance, clawing    back eight places to finish ninth, having started from 17th on the    grid. A drive-through penalty just before the end of the race put    paid to his chances of a better finish. The MINI Electric Pacesetter    inspired by JCW, the official FIA Formula E Safety Car, appeared    twice after incidents had occurred. Günther drove a commanding race after a disappointing Saturday. He  had delivered proof of his pace during the morning qualifying session,  securing a place in the Super Pole competition for the seventh time  this season. He reached sixth in the battle for grid positions,  recording a time of 1:20.398 minutes. Günther was unable to steer  clear of all the incidents as the race progressed at the London  exhibition centre, but he displayed plenty of stamina to maintain his  position to the finish line. Dennis gave another strong performance in the free practice session,  ending the session in second place as he had done on the previous day.  However, his starting position in the drivers’ standings meant that he  had to compete in qualifying group one. He was the first driver out on  the track and secured third place, before being pushed back down to  17th as the session progressed. Dennis mounted a spirited chase in the  race and spent some time ahead of Günther before being knocked back to  ninth place due to a drive-through penalty for a technical infringement. Formula E rookie Dennis is now fourth in the drivers’ standings, with  81 points. Günther is in 15th place, with 62 points. BMW i Andretti  Motorsport is fifth in the team standings with 143 points. The Season 7 finale will take place in three weeks, at the former  Berlin-Tempelhof (GER) airport. After races 14 and 15 complete the  season, one driver will be crowned world champion for the first time  in the history of Formula E. Reactions to Race 13 in London. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 5th place):“The second race here in London was much more eventful. Everyone was  a little more conservative yesterday but it was much more aggressive  today. In the end, we finished with both cars in the points. That’s  what we came here for and that is what helps us in the championship.  Maximilian came home in sixth place; Jake finished ninth. It was a  great performance from Jake, who worked his way up from P17 after a  somewhat disappointing qualifying session. Maximilian reached  Superpole again. We are now fifth in the team standings and we had a  great time here in London. Formula E organised a fantastic event. Now  we are heading into the final two rounds of the world championship in  Berlin. Let’s see what we can achieve.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 17th place,    race result: 9th place, points: 81, driver standings: 4th place):“Overall, we can be very happy with our weekend. We scored points  twice and had a win to celebrate. My car behaved really well from FP1  to the final race on Sunday. We were superfast in each session. I  don’t think that we were ever outside the top five, apart from during  qualifying of course. We moved up from 17th to seventh place and then  I got a drive-through penalty, so that was a bit of a shame. But  overall, it was a great weekend. Now I am looking forward to Berlin.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 6th    place, race result: 6th place, points: 62, driver standings: 15th place):“All in all, it was a solid day. I felt good in my car during free  practice and built a good foundation for qualifying. I can also be  very pleased with group qualifying. I put in a good lap in Superpole,  although the first drops of rain had started to fall. We were just two  tenths of a second away from pole position, which shows how close it  was. We were banking on racing in the rain, but unfortunately that  didn’t happen so the pace was not quite ideal. I also had the feeling  that we could have used attack mode better to finish higher up, but in  motorsport there’s no point thinking about could have, would have. We  gave it everything and scored some good points.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race. The five drivers with the most FANBOOST votes receive an extra  100 kJ of power, which they can make use of during a brief time frame  in the second half of the race.

After his crash on Saturday, the race doctors did not grant    clearance for Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team Bonovo    MGM Racing to compete on Sunday. After some heavy rainfall, there was still water on and around the  circuit in the morning, causing the warm-up session to be postponed by  50 minutes. The start of the morning’s Superpole race was then also  pushed back by ten minutes. The track was then dry, but conditions  still proved to be treacherous in places. Sykes once again gave a  fantastic chase. Starting from 18th on the grid, he moved up ten  positions with his BMW M 1000 RR on the first lap and secured seventh  place on lap four. That was where he finished the sprint race,  claiming seventh spot on the grid for the afternoon’s second race. Van  der Mark also made a good start from ninth only to take a fall a short  time later. This put him eleventh on the grid for race two. At the start of the second race, two riders collided at the front in  turn one – while van der Mark was able to leap forward six places to  move into fifth. Sykes claimed seventh position on lap one, but then  fell back a little. Van der Mark also lost some time. During the  second half of the race, van der Mark and Sykes were then involved in  a duel lying in eighth and ninth places, all while closing in on the  top six. Events took a dramatic turn coming into the final lap; van  der Mark was able to overtake two rivals and secure sixth place, while  Sykes took a tumble. He was able to rejoin the race and finished 15th  to score a point. Markus Schramm, Head of BMW Motorrad, was at Assen to experience the  race weekend on site. “It was super to be back again,” said Schramm on  Sunday afternoon. “I hadn’t been here for over a year and I really  missed it. It was also the first time that I had seen the new BMW M  1000 RR in action in the WorldSBK. It was great to see the BMW family  again and to view the progress that we have made with the M RR. That  is what made it a good weekend.” BMW Motorrad Motorsport can now look forward to a first in two weeks’  time; Most, in the Czech Republic, will host the WorldSBK for the  first time when the sixth event of the season takes place there from  6th to 8th August. Quotes after race two at Assen. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Our  achievements did not match our expectations today. Things did not go  smoothly. Michael made a very good start to the Superpole race in the  morning, but he crashed after letting his motivation get the better of  him. The after-effects of that certainly hampered his efforts in the  second race. He had a great race nonetheless, finishing sixth from  eleventh on the grid. Tom had a really strong Superpole race this  morning, moving up from the back of the field to seventh with some  outstanding pace. That pace could have taken him to within grasp of a  podium from seventh on the grid this afternoon. He fell back a little  in the early stages of the race and then battled his way back together  with Michael. He then slipped out over the front wheel just before the  end, but was able to cross the finishing line in 15th to score a  point. Overall, we definitely could have done better this weekend. I  think that we have shown potential but we were not able to convert it  into results as we had hoped.”   Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “After Saturday’s race one where we were reasonably happy  with the results overall and showed strong lap times, we were looking  to carry those over into today. But it was a tough Superpole Race. For  sure, Michael felt he needed to be with that front group of riders  which yesterday’s pace indicated he could do that. But he  unfortunately crashed out which was a disappointment and set him back  to 11th on the grid for race two. Tom managed to push his way through  and improved on his starting position, which was perfect. Going into  the race, there was a bit of a coming together at T1 which unsettled  the pack, but Michael settled back into a rhythm. However, he couldn’t  find the grip he was looking for. Tom was waiting for his tyre to come  to him but again got stuck in a battle where he was just off the  leading two packs. Overall, it was a tough race. We expected a little  more from the performances but all in all we are showing the  improvement of the bike and that gap to the front is getting narrower  at every event. This is the target with the podium in sight. We take  the positives from this weekend and move to Most where we will pick up  the game from there.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning’s crash was a stupid mistake by myself. I  really wanted to go for it, and on the fastest corners of the track I  tried to go even faster which was a silly mistake on my behalf. In  race two, I had an okay start. I had a bit of luck at T1 starting in  P11 and by the end of lap one I was in fifth but I didn’t have the  pace or the grip I was hoping for. I was struggling to keep the bike  on track and I just didn’t have any more to give so it was quite  tough. But at the end of the race I found a little extra pace and  managed to catch and pass Michael Ruben Rinaldi and Alex Lowes so P6  wasn’t too bad in the end. But I really wanted more.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We managed to  start race two on the third row which was a lot better. We got a much  cleaner start to the race as the guys did a bit of work to the BMW M  1000 RR. We used the harder rear tyre and just couldn’t find the grip  we needed at the beginning of the race but having said that, the bike  stayed very constant throughout the race. Unfortunately coming into  the last corner before entering the final lap, I tried to close the  line and square the corner off and lost the front. It was such a slow  speed crash, but I wasn’t able to save it. It’s such a shame, the bike  today was good enough for that top-six and it would have been nice to  be consistent the whole weekend. It certainly seemed we have made some  good improvements including both me and Michael. A disappointing end  to the weekend but we can take the positives from it, and we will  focus on that and try to build on it for the next round.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was a really  great weekend - until the crash. I am delighted that we were able to  show once again that we have the speed and that we can really compete.  That did us all a lot of good. I actually wanted to race today. I am  still in some pain and a bit stiff walking, but I felt ready.  Unfortunately, the race doctors did not give me the OK. I would like  to thank the team for their great work nonetheless and for getting us  back on track. Thanks also to everyone who has sent their best wishes  after my crash. Now it’s time for a few days of recovery and then we  will go back on the attack at Most the weekend after next.” \n"}
{"prompt":"After a tactically astute and commanding driving performance in his home race in London (GBR), Jake Dennis (GBR) has celebrated his second win in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship for BMW i Andretti Motorsport.  ->","completion":" London. After a tactically astute and commanding driving    performance in his home race in London (GBR), Jake Dennis (GBR) has    celebrated his second win in the ABB FIA Formula E World    Championship for BMW i Andretti Motorsport. The British driver    started the London E-Prix from second on the grid in the #27 BMW    iFE.21. He moved ahead in the opening third of the race, pulled away    from his rivals before using the second attack mode and never looked    likely to surrender the lead. Having already tasted victory at    Valencia (ESP), this is the second time that Dennis has topped the    podium in his Formula E debut season. His team-mate Maximilian    Günther (GER) crossed the finish line in 20th place.  Dennis had already given an impressive performance in the morning’s  free practice session, recording the second-fastest time behind  Günther in difficult and rainy conditions. One feature of the track  layout in particular made the session a challenging one. As one  section of the 2.252-kilometre circuit runs through the surroundings  of ExCel London and another section is located inside the halls  themselves, the drivers struggled with aquaplaning on the wet outdoor  surface, while the track inside the exhibition centre was bone dry. The course gradually dried out as the qualifying session progressed.  Both BMW i Andretti Motorsport drivers were chasing the best time in  group three. Günther’s session ended early after he slammed into a  wall when braking into a corner. Dennis was right behind him and was  forced to abort his fast lap. When qualifying restarted, the British  driver was able to try again. He managed to reach the Super Pole  competition, where he secured second place on the grid that proved to  be the perfect starting point for his victorious drive. This victory sees Dennis move up to third place in the drivers’  standings. He has now scored 79 points and is just two points off the  lead. Günther is in 15th place with 54 points. BMW i Andretti  Motorsport is sixth in the team standings, with 133 points. Race 13 of the season will take place on Sunday in London as well. It  starts at 15:00 CEST (14:00 local time). Reactions to Race 12 in London. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“From Jake's point of view, it was a strong qualifying session that  put him on the front row. After a sensible start from him, he settled  into a good rhythm and then we experienced some smart driving from him  and some smart strategy calls from the engineering team. We saw the  result with Jake on the podium and massive rewards towards his  championship position. On Maximilian's side of the garage it was a  different story. What was looking like a good qualifying lap really  came to nothing with the impact into the wall. It took a big team  effort to get the car rebuilt in time for the race. Both car crews got  together and worked well. That shows the strength of the team.  Unfortunately with Maximilian starting from the back, it meant it was  going to be hard work all afternoon. He made up some positions, but  after another contact he slipped back to P20. I am looking forward to  tomorrow. Let’s see what we can do again here in London.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 2nd    place, race result: 1st place, points: 79, driver    standings: 3rd place):“I am super happy. I pretty much didn't know what to expect going  into the race. It was a little bit different to normal, with really  not much energy-saving going on. It was obviously an intense battle  with Alex Lynn; I was trying to put him under pressure. We took the  risk to stay up in front when he took his second attack mode. I knew I  could keep him behind, but I didn’t know if it would work out better  or not. Luckily he made a small mistake and then it was about three  qualifying laps to pull the two-second gap before I went for my second  attack mode. Then it was just a matter of bringing it home when we got  the lead. We had really severe vibrations on the right rear. It was  probably in the last 15 laps of the race. I was generally not taking  any kerb just to make sure to bring it home. Now being third in the  championship is far more than I expected at the beginning of the season.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    24th place, race result: 20th place, points:    54, driver standings: 15th place):“Congratulations to the entire team. Unfortunately, I could not see  what was going on ahead in the race from where I was, but of course,  that was a great job by Jake. He was great in qualifying and drove a  superb race. During practice, I felt good in the car. It was the same  in qualifying too but then I unfortunately had that crash. That was  the end of our chances for today. That is hard to take but it is also  part of the business. In the race, I did all I could to get the most  out of it but I was a long way from the points. Tomorrow is a brand  new day and that is what we are concentrating on now.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

{"prompt":"BMW Motorrad Motorsport gave a strong performance in Saturday’s race at Assen (NED) to confirm the upward trend in the FIM Superbike World Championship, but a serious accident for Jonas Folger (GER) overshadowed the good results. ->","completion":" Assen. BMW Motorrad Motorsport gave a strong performance in    Saturday’s race at Assen (NED) to confirm the upward trend in the    FIM Superbike World Championship, but a serious accident for Jonas    Folger (GER) overshadowed the good results. Running in seventh    place, the rider from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing    crashed out just before the finish. After initial examinations in    the Medical Centre, Folger was transferred to hospital for further    checks as a precautionary measure, which he was able to leave again    in the meantime. Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad    WorldSBK Team was fourth in the first race on his home circuit. His    team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR), who started from 20th on the grid, was    classified seventh. Folger had been the fastest BMW rider after a strong performance in  the morning’s Superpole. He claimed sixth spot, on the second row of  the grid. Van der Mark finished Superpole in ninth place. Sykes  endured some back luck, as a technical issue prevented him from taking  to the track until the end of the session. He chalked up the  second-fastest time but the lap was not classified as it had begun  just a few fractions of a second too late. As Sykes’ time did not  count, he had to start from 20th on the grid. All three BMW riders gave impressively strong performances in the  race itself. At the start, Folger defended his sixth place, van der  Mark fell back for a brief period and Sykes moved up five positions  straight away. However, van der Mark sprinted quickly up through the  field, reaching fifth place on lap three. One lap later, he was in  fourth and intent on closing the gap to the leading trio. Folger held  on to sixth spot before dropping down one place on lap 16. Meanwhile,  Sykes continued to work his way up through the field from the back,  reaching eighth position. Folger, however, crashed out two laps before  the end, leading to an immediate red flag. Quotes after race one at Assen. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  most important thing is that Jonas is doing pretty well after that  fall. That was a day of mixed feelings for us. We had to switch  Michael’s engine in the morning and he was unable to participate in  the third free practice session. We had a technical problem with Tom  during qualifying. We were able to fix that and he still recorded a  fast lap, which would have been good enough for second place but the  lap was not classified as he crossed the line just shortly after the  end of the session meaning that he started from 20th on the grid.  After missing out on practice, Michael put in a good lap to secure  ninth place in qualifying. Jonas was doing really well and it was  great to see him placed so high up. At the start of the race, Michael  was pushed wide on turn one and fell back to 13th place, but he  recovered from that very quickly and finished fourth in the end, 1.2  seconds away from the podium. That was a really strong performance,  which we had not expected after this morning. Tom also rode a very  good race after starting at the back. In the second half of the race,  he was the fastest rider out there with his lap times. Starting from  sixth on the grid, Jonas was able to keep pace very well and we could  see that the work had paid off. Unfortunately, he crashed out on one  of the fastest corners on this circuit and slid under the air-fence.  We were glad to get the news that he is doing well after some initial  examinations. We will start from the same positions tomorrow but if we  produce the same level of performance in the race as we did today, we  are well set to aim for a podium finish.”   Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Both riders really showed their fighting spirit. After  having missed this morning’s FP3, Michael struggled a bit in Superpole  to make best use of his tyre so he did a really good job to put it on  the third row of the grid. Tom sadly had a technical issue, and to  miss the chequered flag by so narrowly and his lap, which would have  put him second on the grid, not counting really was cruel luck for  him. So he had to start from the back but both riders did a fantastic  job in the race. Michael lost a lot of time coming together with Lucas  Mahias in a typical first corner melee but fought back very well. I  think if it wasn’t for that he could have been in the battle for the  podium positions because finishing just a bit more of a second behind  when the red flag came out showed how much progress he had made. And  equally Tom came through very well from the grid. We will take that  result and build on that. Tomorrow is another day and overall it has  been a good job in the circumstances. I am very proud of the guys and  all the hard work they have done on and off the track. We are looking  forward to tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was a tough Saturday, to be honest. This morning, I did not do any  laps as we had a mechanical problem and so we went straight into  Superpole. We thought we can do two laps with the qualifying tyre but  I could just do one so it was quite tough. P9 on the grid wasn’t  great, and also my start was not the best. I had some wheelieing and  lost some positions there, then I got a bit of wrangling with another  rider going into turn one and the first lap wasn’t really clean, but  then straight away I had a good pace and I managed to pass some riders  one by one. At the end I had a similar pace as the guys in front of me  who were fighting for the podium but I just could not get any closer.  We need to find a little bit extra grip to have the pace so I can  battle with them.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a  little bit of a character building day. We have been unlucky in  Superpole and that set the scene for the opening race today. We had a  slight technical issue; fair play to the marshals who brought the bike  back. The boys did an unbelievable job to get me back out there and we  managed to get a lap in which was good enough for second position on  the grid but unfortunately it wasn’t to be. Then at the start of the  race, we made an acceptable first lap and away we went. Unfortunately  we had some limitations, I feel we had an issue which made it  difficult for me to consistently make the apex. We will check that and  again, we understand the bike a little bit more. For tomorrow we will  make some changes. Overall, it was again a strong showing from BMW  from a not so good start position. Michael rode a very strong race and  it is just proof that we have been working hard.” \n"}

At the final concert of the BMW Welt Jazz  Award 2020 held on Friday evening, the Peter Gall Quintet won over the  award’s renowned jury. Together with saxophonist Wanja Slavin, Dutch  guitarist Reinier Baas, pianist Reiner Böhm and up-and-coming bassist  Felix Henkelhausen, drummer Peter Gall prevailed against the dam  Bałdych Quartet. Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of  BMW AG, presented the prize together with Anton Biebl, Head of the  Department of Cultural Affairs of the state capital Munich.Following the theme “The Melody at Night”, the concerts of the BMW  Welt Jazz Award 2020 were presented at BMW Welt’s double coned  structure and for the first time on Tuesday evenings. Having been  postponed for over a year due to the global pandemic, the final  concert of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 now took place at the  philharmonic hall at Gasteig, thanks to the city of Munich.The expert jury said: “Both finalists convincingly brought the motto  ‘The Melody at Night’ of this BMW Welt Jazz Award edition to life with  a personal twist of their own. Adam Bałdych has once again proven to  be a technically and stylistically unique violinist. And the drummer  Peter Gall, who has already shown his brilliance in so many ways while  participating in the projects of others, has proven to be an  outstanding composer and great band leader with his very first work of  his own. Together with his dream team, the all-star quintet starring  Rainer Böhm, Reinier Baas, Wanja Slavin and Felix Henkelhausen, Gall  generates a veritable intoxication of sound. As complex and  interconnected the song structures are, they are simultaneously  powerful, exciting and simply created to take in and enjoy. Many  elements flow into this endeavor – and everything fits together  fantastically as well as harmoniously. A real somnambulistic  ‘Dreambox’ as the album is titled. A magic box so thrilling and  inspiring that the jury would like to congratulate Peter Gall and his  quintet for winning the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020.”Peter Gall Quintet received a prize money of 10,000 Euro as well as  the trophy designed by BMW Design. The runner up Adam Bałdych Quartet  was awarded 5,000 Euro.In addition to the award and supported by the jazz award’s partner  Bayerischer Hof, the public’s favorite was also selected. Based on  audience votes at each performance, Adam Bałdych Quartet excited the  guests and will therefore receive an exclusive performance at the  Night Club of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich.Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG,  Director of Hu-man Resources and Labour Relations, praised the skills  of the finalists: “I am delighted that we were now able to hold the  final concert of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 this year and celebrate  its winner. My fullest congratulations to the Peter Gall Quintet. I  would also like to thank our long-standing partners, especially the  state capital Munich. Together with them, the BMW Group stands for  reliability and takes its social and cultural responsibilities  seriously for already 50 years now.Therefore, it gives me great  pleasure that the BMW Welt Jazz Award will also be continued next  year. Following the theme ‘Key Position’, the BMW Welt Jazz Award will  focus on one of the characterizing instruments of jazz music: the  piano. It has been playing an important role and has been inspiring  audiences from the very beginning with ragtime and boogie woogie over  great bigband pianists and legends of modern jazz until now.”“I cannot think of our city’s cultural life without the BMW Welt Jazz  Award anymore. The series of concerts at BMW Welt with high-ranking  jazz ensembles gives free access to thousands of music fans for many  years now. I am very grateful to our partner BMW for their great and  continuous cultural engagement over all those years. It fills me with  joy that by providing the philharmonic hall for this year’s final  concert, a large audience could be a part of it following the  necessary COVID regulations,” said Anton Biebl, Head of the Department  of Cultural Affairs of the state capital Munich.Different from the previous years, there were only five instead of  six performances given by renowned ensembles from around the world in  the double coned structure of BMW Welt in January and February 2020.  Besides the two finalists, the musicians playing in the double cone  structure of BMW Welt were: Cecilie Grundt Quintet (Norway), the  Andrea Hermenau Quintet (Germany) and Reis\/Demuth\/Wiltgen  (Luxembourg). The sixth concert with the Giovanni Guidi Quintet  (Italy) had to be cancelled due to related measures taken to control  the corona virus. The Italian jazz pianist and his quintet will now  perform at BMW Welt Jazz Award 2022 following the theme “Key Position”.The winner of the BMW Welt Jazz Award 2020 was selected by a  top-class jury of reputable jazz experts and connoisseurs.

To celebrate 50 years of cultural commitment,  BMW is joining forces with Acute Art to initiate a unique exhibition:  For the first time ever the renowned BMW Art Car Collection is shown  in augmented reality (AR). On July 21, the project is launched via the  free Acute Art app, marking the first time that the digital rolling  sculptures are available for everyone all around the world at any time.Initiated by French race car driver and art aficionado Hervé Poulain  and conceived in collaboration with the founder of BMW Motorsport  Jochen Neerpasch, the first BMW Art Car was commissioned when both  asked Alexander Calder to design Poulain’s BMW race car in 1975. Since  then, 19 prominent artists from throughout the world have designed BMW  automobiles of their times, all making extremely different artistic  statements and reflecting the cultural and historical development of  art, design, and technology. On the occasion of 50 years of BMW Group  Cultural Engagement, the Art Cars are finally entering the digital  realm and can virtually be staged in this wholly immersive 360°  exhibition: indoors, outdoors and in any location the user desires.On July 21, the first BMW Art Cars can be experienced via the App:  Alexander Calder (BMW 3.0 CSL, 1975), Michael Jagamara Nelson (BMW M3,  1989), Ken Done (BMW M3, 1989), Matazo Kayama (BMW 535i, 1990), Esther  Mahlangu (BMW 525i, 1991), Jeff Koons (BMW M3 GT2, 2010) and John  Baldessari (BMW M6 GTLM, 2016). From then on, further BMW Art Cars  will be integrated in the Acute Art App every two weeks. On time for  the Art Basel in Basel all Art Cars will be included in the App.To fully discover and experience the interactive BMW Art Cars, the  Acute Art app is available free of charge on the App  Store and Google Play.1.

Through  mutual respect and curiosity, BMW is connecting people through culture  across the globe – both physically and virtually. This is why BMW is  partnering up with Acute Art: to push the physical boundaries of art  by exploring the medium in a different dimension.“The BMW Art Cars are an essential part of the DNA of BMW’s  50-year-long cultural engagement. Finally, they are entering the  digital realm and can be accessible everywhere and for everyone. I am  excited about the collaboration with Acute Art as we both strive for  innovation and cutting edge technology. I can‘t wait to place the Art  Cars in my living room and get behind the wheel of these exceptional  masterpieces!”, says Pieter Nota, member of the Board of    Management of BMW AG responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. Acute Art collaborates with the world’s leading  contemporary artists, providing access to cutting-edge technologies  that allow them to translate their creative vision into new digital  mediums – including virtual, augmented and mixed realities. Today’s  immersive media give rise to new possibilities for the production and  distribution of art and the arrival of augmented reality makes  possible entirely new exhibition formats.“We are thrilled about this partnership with BMW, a company that has  demonstrated an exceptional commitment to technological innovation and  art over decades” says Jacob De Geer, CEO of Acute  Art. “Acute Art was founded on the vision of democratising  art and bringing it to places where it could not be before. In these  challenging times we have to find new solutions. The collaboration  with the BMW Group will intensify the exchange between technology,  design and art. Together we will explore future landscapes involving  today’s most innovative minds working in these fields.”Acute Art’s collaboration with the BMW Group will make the Art Cars  digitally visible anywhere in the world for the very first time.  Through the app, they can be individually displayed, or users can also  display multiple vehicles together at the same time.

Having taken a year's break due to the Coronavirus pandemic,    the FIM Superbike World Championship is returning to the TT Circuit    at Assen (NED) this coming weekend (23rd to 25th July). The fifth    event of the 2021 season will take place at the historic circuit in    north-eastern Netherlands. The first motorbike race in the region    took place as long ago as 1925 and the permanent circuit was opened    in 1955. Racers and fans are equally enthusiastic about the    challenging course, which boasts high speeds and swift changes of direction. At Assen, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team will be aiming to build on  the successful weekend at Donington Park (GBR), where Tom Sykes (GBR)  and Michael van der Mark (NED) recorded the first WorldSBK podiums for  the new BMW M 1000 RR. The BMW satellite team MGM Racing will again be  competing with Jonas Folger (GER) at Assen. For internal reasons, the  RC Squadra Corse team will not be attending the Assen round. Quotes ahead of the Assen round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Assen is a very special circuit and you can really feel the  over 100 years of motorbike tradition in every corner. Of course, the  podiums at Donington Park have given us some extra momentum for Assen,  but we know that we still have a lot of work ahead of us. Now we need  to back up the results from Donington. The TT Circuit has a very  special character. It's a fast track layout with lots of leaning and  some high outside turns – these are the challenges that we face during  setup for our BMW M 1000 RR. We are looking forward to the Assen  weekend and also to the enthusiastic Dutch fans, who are sure to  generate a great atmosphere once again at the TT Circuit. We deeply  regret that RC Squadra Corse is unable to participate at Assen and we  hope to see them back on the track again soon.”   Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “The team came away from round four at Donington Park with a  very positive state of mind. Both Tom and Michael reached the level we  were hoping in a successful event with some podium success. But more  important for us is that the gap to the front is much reduced, which  is our target. We are going to Assen having had a strong performance  there the last time we were there in 2019. We aim to take over our  level of performance from Donington Park over to Assen. For sure,  Michael will have a home turf advantage similar to Tom at Donington,  but in general we believe the BMW M 1000 RR can performance strongly  at Assen. Overall, our expectations are that we can continue the good  work at Donington and continue to close the gap to the leading group.  If we succeed in doing so we would be very happy.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Obviously I  am very much looking forward to Assen. On the back of some strong  results for the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team at Donington I am  going to Assen trying to keep that momentum going. We have certainly  found some improvements with the new BMW M 1000 RR and Assen to me is  a circuit I really enjoy. It’s a very exciting track and my target  would be to get back on the podium. That’s what I am aiming for and  for my team-mate Michael, it’s his home race, so he will be pushing  for something extra. Overall I think we have all ingredients to try to  make it a successful weekend again. It will also be a pleasure to see  fans on the grandstands again after they already cheered us at  Donington so I am looking forward to that as well.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Assen is a special race for me, my home race, and I missed  it last year. It definitely is one of my favourite tracks, also  because I really enjoy the fast and flowing bits. Especially the last  part of the circuit is great; it’s fast and flowing and with the last  chicane there is always really nice action there. We are making steady  progress with our BMW M 1000 RR and at Donington we had a really good  weekend with both of our BMWs with finishing on the podium in the  Superpole race and Tom also reaching the podium in race two. We now  want to continue this progress and of course it would be really nice  to even do a bit more at my home race. It is also fantastic that we  will have fans at the grandstands for my home round. I am really  looking forward to it.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I am already  looking forward to Assen. We have analysed the data from Donington in  detail and fixed a fault that we noticed. Now that we know what was  causing the problem, we have the strength to head to Assen and make a  positive start to the weekend. I hope the weather stays fine and I am  looking forward to the circuit. It is a great circuit that suits me  very well. We are aiming to record a clear upturn in form.”  Track Facts Assen.Circuit        length4.542          km – clockwiseCorners18 – 12 right-handers, 6 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight300          metres (start-finish straight)Grip levelHigh (new asphalt)Track        layoutMainly flowing, partly very fast sections;          partly slow cornersStrain on        brakesComparably lowAmount at full        throttle26          % resp. 25 secondsTop speed \/ lowest        speed299          km\/h \/ 55 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityT16Key        factorsMuch          confidence in the front in maximum lean angle and on the          brake; good stability  \n"}

{"prompt":"In our preview, we present the most important facts and key factors of the London E-Prix. ->","completion":" Munich. After Maximilian Günther’s (GER) victory in New York    City (USA), BMW i Andretti Motorsport now heads to the team’s next    home event, the London E-Prix (GBR). The team’s headquarters in    Banbury (GBR) is less than 150 kilometres from the ‘ExCel Circuit’.    The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to London for the    first time since 2016 with races 12 and 13 of the season on Saturday    and Sunday. One of the features of the new circuit is that it is    partly outside and partly in the halls of the ExCel London    exhibition centre. Günther and Jake Dennis (GBR), for whom the    London E-Prix (GBR) is also a home outing, lie 14th and    15th in the Drivers’ Championship – each with 54 points –    ahead of the penultimate race weekend of the season. However, they    trail the championship leader by just 27 points. BMW i Andretti    Motorsport is currently sixth in the Team competition with 108    points. In our preview, we present the most important facts and key    factors of the London E-Prix. You can find detailed information in our media guide: https:\/\/b.mw\/Formula_E_Media_Guide.

It is fantastic to be back in  London after such a long absence. A new and very unique venue for all.  It’s the first time that the track will feature an indoor section as  well as the conventional outdoor surfaces. At this stage, we know  little of the track surface and how this will evolve with cars running  on it. Fortunately, we have a practice session on the Friday afternoon  which will give us overnight to review and consider how we might adapt  to the new circuit. For the first time as well, the FIA has decided to  reduce the amount of available energy to us for the race by just under  ten percent. The nature of the track with the full amount of energy  would likely have led to flat out racing but the reduced amount will  bring back an element of energy saving. Both drivers now have a win a  piece and I am sure both will be vying for more success. There is a  lot to play for in both the team’s and driver’s championships.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21):“I am extremely excited about my home race in London. Nobody knows  the circuit, which suits me as a rookie. I hope we come out of the  blocks quickly in the first practice session and qualify well. It  looks as though it is going to be difficult to overtake, which makes  it all the more important to secure a good grid position.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21):“London is an outstanding place to go racing. It’s a really cool  element to be racing indoor and outdoor. The track looks very  technical and I definitely can’t wait to drive my first proper laps  there. We are heading into the last four races of the season and  everything is possible. So as always, we just focus on a good  performance from our side.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

Second race and a second podium finish for the BMW    Motorrad World Endurance Team and the new #37 BMW M 1000 RR in the    FIM Endurance World Championship 2021 (FIM EWC). In the, at times,    dramatic 12-hour race at Estoril (POR), Xavi Forés (ESP), Markus    Reiterberger (GER) and Kenny Foray (FRA) secured third place on the    podium as at the Le Mans (FRA) season opener. Once again they    battled their way back up the field impressively after a fall in the    opening stage forced the team right down the field to start with.    The podium finish was a fitting present for Team Manager Werner    Daemen’s 50th birthday. Everything was going perfectly for the BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team to begin with. Starting from second on the grid, Forés took the  lead after just a few minutes. The #37 M RR dropped back into second  place briefly after about 50 minutes, but was soon back in front.  Reiterberger then extended the lead but after almost two and a half  hours of racing Foray skidded while in the lead and fell. He returned  the #37 M RR to the pits and after a repair break lasting four and a  half minutes it was back to the race. The BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team was temporarily in 20th place and trailing by four laps, but from  there the only way was up. The rest of the race was turbulent at times, with various race  leaders dropping right down the field after falls or issues, but went  without a hitch for Forés, Reiterberger and Foray and they made up  place after place with fast lap times. Forés held the fastest lap time  of the whole field for quite some time. After five hours of racing  they had worked their way into the top ten. The trio was in sixth  place after seven hours, and moved up into fourth place soon after,  when two motorbikes in the leading pack collided. That was when the  BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team set about reducing the margin to the  top three. In the final stage the race became something of a real sprint  thriller. Ninety minutes before the end the team leading at that time  developed a problem which put the podium within realistic reach of the  #37 M RR. When all the teams had completed their final pit stops 30  minutes before the chequered flag, Reiterberger, the closing rider,  was just ten seconds off the podium. He really went for it and set the  team’s fastest race lap in the final stint (just six-thousandths of a  second behind the fastest lap overall). Reiterberger closed the gap to  two seconds – and just a few minutes before the end of the race, the  rider in third place ended up in the gravel. That cleared the path to  third place and the second podium finish in a row. After 416 laps,  Reiterberger crossed the finish line in third place with the #37 M RR,  just 0.976 seconds behind second place. The privateer BMW squad Team LRP Poland finished in 16th place. The  riders of the #90 BMW S 1000 RR were Nigel Walraven (NED), Stefan  Kerschbaumer (AUT) and Thomas Gradinger (AUT). Quotes after the ‘12 Hours of Estoril’. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Congratulations to the whole team on another fantastic  performance. It was a real thriller and history repeated itself. It  was similar to Le Mans: leading shortly after the start, then a  setback, then moving up the field to finish on the podium. We weren’t  quite able to race at our pace in the first stint with the cool track  temperatures. Things went really well from the second stint and our  pace was definitely good enough to win. Unfortunately, Kenny fell and  we dropped down to P20. Everyone did a magnificent job in the ensuing  race to catch up. Our pace was really good down to the wire, but  realistically we wouldn’t have done better than P4 or P5. But the  other teams also experienced a few dramas, so the battle for P2 to P4  was really close in the end. We had to change the brakes, which was  planned, but the final two stints from Xavi and Markus were incredibly  strong so we really piled the pressure on the rider in third place. To  end up finishing in P3 less than one second behind second place –  after the fall at the beginning – we have to be pleased with that  result. We saw that we had the pace required to win. Now we are in a  very good starting position for the rest of the season, and our motto  for the Bol d’Or in September is ‘full attack’. After all, we are  still in with a chance of winning the world championship. We still  have some work to do, but have a very good team, a very good bike, and  the potential to become even better. I’d like to thank the team, they  did a fantastic job, were great in the pit stops, and I’m happy that  we could mark Werner Daemen’s 50th birthday by gifting him this podium.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “What a big day. It was a very exciting day, to be honest.  I’m really enjoying my present now. It also was a very difficult day  with the crash and some small issues but in the end we got the podium  and I am really, really happy. I think the team again did a great job  and except for the crash, everything was perfect and we showed again  that we are among the top runners in the World Championship. I am sure  that soon we can reach the highest step of the podium.” Markus Reiterberger: “Xavi did a great opening stint.  I took over being in the lead, was able to extend the gap again and  hand over the bike in the lead, too. Unfortunately, Kenny then fell.  Initially, that was a setback for us all but we kept our focus and  always said that we try to get the best out of it. 12 hours is not as  long as 24 hours but we still can achieve something. Xavi did really  strong lap times and I then was able, especially in my last stint, to  give my everything. The bike worked perfectly for me in cooler  conditions. I really pushed and if the race had lasted one lap more,  even second place would have been possible. But we made it to the  podium and that is the main thing. We are still in the mix in the  World Championship.” Xavi Forés: “It was a very tough race. Honestly,  after the crash we could not expect to finish on the podium. But we  had a really good pace, the bike was working really well, so credit to  all the team that worked amazingly to fix the bike in a way that I  could get 1:39 times in all my stints. I am really happy with the  performance we had all weekend. We have shown that we are really  strong and as soon as we can complete the race with no mistakes or  issues we will be on the top step. Thank you to the entire team and to  Markus and Kenny; they did an amazing job. Now roll on Le Castellet in September.” Kenny Foray: “First of all I want to apologise for my  crash. It was a small mistake but it what it is. I am very  disappointed about it because I think today it was possible to easily  win. The bike was perfect, the tyre, too, and the riders were strong.  Especially my team-mates were incredible. I love endurance for that;  you never give up and that we could make it to the podium was  fantastic. A big thank you to the team, thank you to Xavi and Markus,  because it was an incredible effort today.” \n"}

It was difficult to  manage the tyre and I didn’t have a clear lap. But overall we are  happy with the race pace and the feeling with the race tyre. So for  me, I am confident for tomorrow.

Of the 250-plus applications that came in,  only five made it onto the shortlist – but ultimately it was Leipzig  that won. Twenty years ago, on 18 July 2001, the BMW Group announced  at a press conference in Munich that it would build a new plant in  Leipzig. “Here you can see the location that best meets our needs  overall,” said Prof. Joachim Milberg, Chairman of the BMW AG Board of  Management at the time.Leipzig as a base and the over 200-hectare site near the city’s  exhibition centre won on the basis of the following criteria:1. Ideal conditions and location for a future plant2. Availability of qualified personnel3. Use of existing supplies and logistics structures4. Very good infrastructure for traffic, supplies and waste5. Links to the BMW production network6. Fast implementation process7. Economic efficiency and flexibilityAt the time, the BMW Group expected… 5,500halfat in the new plant  Daily output from 2005 was projected to be 650 units, at an investment  of around €1 billion. When production was finally launched, the plant  employed about 2,500 people. Today, twenty years later, daily output  stands at more than 1,100 units, made by a plant workforce of over  8,000 employees. Investments have so far totalled more than €3 billion  and are still ongoing. Since March 2005 Leipzig has produced more than  three million vehicles in total. Speaking about the positive  development of Leipzig, Works Council Chairman Jens Köhler expressed  his delight: “Ever since the decision was made, the management and  Works Council have cooperated to increase the workforce considerably  and make us an integral part of the region.”The choice of Leipzig received an enthusiastic welcome, and support  in the region was huge. There was also a vast number of job  applicants: the day after the announcement, the dedicated call centre  received more than 4,000 calls, and boxes and boxes of mail came in in  a matter of days. In September 2001, a first cohort of 35 trainees  began work at BMW Group Plant Leipzig. Since then Plant Leipzig has  welcomed 900 apprentices, almost all of whom continue to work there.The BMW Group laid the foundation in Leipzig for one of the most  sustainable, state-of-the-art vehicle plants in the world. Its  particularly well thought-out, flexible structures are an outstanding  feature and include the ‘finger’ layout of the assembly hall – a world  first that enables ideal logistics solutions and offers plenty of  scope for flexibility. Specially developed for Plant Leipzig, the  ‘finger’ layout allows trucks to deliver purchased parts and  pre-assemblies straight to the lineside. In addition, new production  stages can be integrated into the process and lines can be extended  without requiring new buildings.Since 2005 Plant Leipzig has consistently demonstrated its  adaptability, integrating new products, processes and technologies and  often playing a pioneering role within the BMW Group production  network. As the birthplace of electromobility at the BMW Group, for  example, Leipzig has manufactured over 200,000 fully electric BMW i3  cars and was the first car plant in the world to use CFRP (carbon  fibre-reinforced plastic) in series production. The BMW Group  continues to benefit from the plant’s collective skills in the field  of electromobility, and Leipzig has been part of the international  production network for high-voltage batteries since May of this year.In 2023 Leipzig will demonstrate its flexibility once again, when it  becomes the first German facility to produce both BMW and MINI  vehicles, all on the same production line. Contracted to manufacture  the all-new successor to the current MINI Countryman, the plant will  make both the combustion-powered and the fully electric versions.  “Over the last few years, we have worked constantly to lead our plant  into a successful future. The contract to manufacture the MINI  Countryman successor is taking us towards a further milestone,” said  Hans-Peter Kemser, Plant Director at BMW Group Plant Leipzig. And  that’s not the only goal Leipzig has set itself: “As a green plant, we  want not only to be carbon-neutral but also to manufacture with zero  CO2 emissions,” said Hans-Peter Kemser, announcing plans for the near  future of the plant.Burkhard Jung, Lord Mayor of Leipzig, also sees the BMW Group’s  choice of Leipzig as a major milestone for the city and region:  “Leipzig is an industrial base again. This development – which has  been so important for us in economic terms – would have been almost  unimaginable without the decision that was made in Munich 20 years  ago. Over the last two decades, the north of Leipzig has evolved to  become an industry heartland for the entire region. It’s a  technological and industrial development that is benefitting people  from Leipzig and far beyond. BMW in Leipzig not only produces cars but  also works on the vehicles and production methods of the future. That  fills me with confidence: Leipzig will remain particularly important,  both for the transformation of transport and in the development of new technologies.”Key events, past and future, at BMW Group Plant Leipzig:\n"}

The second edition of the Berlin Brawl took the United    in Rivalry teams supported by BMW and their fans back in time. On    Monday, players from G2 Esports, FNATIC, OG Esports and FunPlus    Phoenix met at LVL World of Gaming in Berlin (GER) and entered    unfamiliar territory. Instead of showing off their skills in League    of Legends, Dota 2 or Valorant, they entered the world of arcade    games and duelled each other in three cult classics from the 1980s:    Vulgus, Strider and Street Fighter II Turbo. Victory went to FNATIC,    as it did last year. In keeping with the ethos of the Berlin Brawl,    hosted by Eefje Depoortere, as Official Automotive Partner at LVL    World of Gaming, BMW showcased a real cult car, the Ken Done BMW M3    Art Car from 1989. “This Berlin Brawl with a retro look reminded us once again that the  obsession with Esports and gaming is not a new phenomenon, it has  decades of tradition,” said Ingmar Johannsen, Head of BMW Esports.  “Congratulations to Bwipo and FNATIC, who had also edged it against G2  Esports at the Brawl premiere in 2020. Once again LVL World of Gaming  was a fantastic stage for our United in Rivalry derby. It’s fantastic  that this event got our collaboration as Official Automotive Partner  off to a spectacular start. At times there were more than 12,000  viewers following the Berlin Brawl at the same time on Twitch. The  response from the community was very positive. Thank you to all teams  who got involved in this journey to the 1980s.” BMW Esports teams were represented by the players Caps, Mikyx (both  G2 Esports), Bean, Bwipo (both FNATIC), N0tail (OG Esports) and ANGE1  (FunPlus Phoenix) in Berlin. The challenge was to modify their skills  perfected for modern games to suit three cult classics. Bwipo was the  most successful, beating Caps in the final. To celebrate both the arcade game era in the 1980s and the new  partnership between BMW and LVL World of Gaming, the BMW M3 Art Car of  artist Ken Done from 1989 was on display in Berlin. There is a long  tradition of BMW Art Cars. From the 1970s to today, world-famous  artists such as Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Jeff Koons have  immortalized themselves with their designs on BMW racing and road  cars. The BMW M3 made its debut in 1987, the same year that the Vulgus  game was released, and the first Street Fighter. Street Fighter II  Turbo followed in 1992, the same year in which the second-generation  BMW M3 was launched. As part of the Berlin Brawl, BMW also gave fans the opportunity to  get further acquainted with The Rival Rig, which had made its debut at  the BMW Esports Boost at the end of June. This visionary Esports  hardware is the first product from the virtual RIVALWORKS technology  factory. The Berlin Brawl was also the first event made available for  the community to follow on the new BMW Esports Discord server. BMW  will now also present itself to fans on this communication platform  used by gamers around the world at www.discord.gg\/bmwesports. About BMW Esports.BMW has been collaborating with five of the world’s best teams as a  partner in the classic League of Legends game since 2020. Cloud 9,  FNATIC, FunPlus Phoenix, G2 Esports and T1 fly the BMW colours in the  biggest events in the industry.

The stage is set for the second round of the FIM Endurance    World Championship 2021 (FIM EWC): This Saturday (17th July) BMW    Motorrad World Endurance Team will take on the 12-hour race at    Estoril, Portugal. After third place on the podium at the season    opener, the 24 Hours of Le Mans (FRA) in June, Werner Daemen’s team    is confident ahead of the second endurance race with the new #37 BMW    M 1000 RR. The #37 M RR will be ridden by Markus Reiterberger (GER), Xavi Forés  (ESP) and Kenny Foray (FRA), the fourth rider of the BMW Motorrad  World Endurance Team, at Estoril. Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) will be in  action in the International German Motorcycle Championship (IDM) at  the Nürburgring (GER) at the same time. Forés was recently forced to  sit out races after injuring his wrist in the British Superbike  Championship (BSB) but was able to take part in the Estoril test rides  without any restrictions on Tuesday, and was given the go-ahead to  race at the weekend by the official FIM race doctors on late Tuesday  afternoon. Eugene Laverty (IRL) was on hand just in case Forés was  unable to ride, which is why he also completed test laps on the #37  BMW M 1000 RR on Tuesday. Last year the 12-hour race in Estoril was held as the season finale  in September. From third on the grid, BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team took an early lead and broke away from the pack. After a fall and  ensuing repair break, the team battled its way back up the field from  19th place to finish the race in seventh place. In addition to BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team, privateers BMW Team  LRP Poland will also be in action at Estoril with the #90 BMW S 1000 RR. Quotes ahead of the ‘12 Hours Estoril’. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “Our  goal at Estoril is to carry on where we left off with the strong  performance at Le Mans. We proved the potential of our new BMW M 1000  RR in endurance racing. We were initially pushed back down the field  due to a technical issue, but the team resolved it quickly. The test  on Tuesday was promising once again, so we are optimistic going into  the race weekend. All three of our riders, Markus, Xavi and Kenny,  were riding at the same very high level once again so we are  well-prepared and hope to be as strong as we were at Le Mans. Thanks  also go to Eugene for coming to Estoril at short notice to jump in as  reserve rider if necessary.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “If you see the result from Le Mans where we finished third  despite some setbacks, I expect that we will aim for the podium again  as a minimum. If we stay on two wheels and if we don’t have any  technical problems, which I’m not expecting, I think we will be among  the frontrunners, going for the podium or maybe more.” Markus Reiterberger: “We’re very confident and highly  motivated going into the second race of the FIM EWC season at Estoril.  We have good memories of last year’s event, and it’s a fantastic track  that should suit our motorbike and the tyres should perform well again  there. I expect that it will be really hot, which will be a big  challenge for everyone but we are well-prepared. The team has been  working on the motorbike intensively since Le Mans, and I hope that we  will be able to take the next step and do battle for the win with our  package. We’re hoping for a great, accident-free, successful weekend.  I’m really looking forward to Estoril.” Xavi Forés: “I am really focused on the Estoril race.  It is going to be a very important race for us because we had a good  finish at Le Mans, so the feeling we have from the bike and the tyres  is quite good. I hope that Estoril will suit us all. Last year, the  team did a great job there and I was also fast in World Superbikes  there so hopefully we can do a very good job. The target definitely  has to be to go out and try to fight for the win.” Kenny Foray: “I am really looking forward to being  part of the #37 BMW M 1000 RR line-up in the second round of the FIM  EWC season. It is great to be back on the bike and to ride with Reiti  and Xavi. I think it is possible to secure a strong result. I will  give it my all to help the team to be successful, I will definitely  enjoy this week and I am sure that we will be strong.”\n"}

Starting today, researchers, start-ups and  pioneering companies from the global quantum computing community can  propose solutions for specific industrial challenges to the BMW    Group Quantum Computing Challenge. Run in collaboration with  Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), the Challenge encourages entrants to  come up with innovative quantum algorithms and test their solutions on  real quantum computing technologies. Quantum computing holds potential  to address challenging problems in the automotive sector in complex  optimisation, materials research, and – in the form of quantum machine  learning – automated driving in tomorrow’s world. Peter Lehnert, Vice President BMW Group Research, New  Technologies: “The technological landscape in the field of  quantum computing is only just starting to take shape. Different firms  and research institutes are pursuing a variety of approaches. By  launching our crowd innovation initiative, we are hoping to tap into  additional innovative power that would be beyond the reach of a  standard tendering process.” Specific challenges for quantum computing.Experts from the BMW Group have identified over 50 challenges at  various stages of the value chain where quantum computing could  provide a potential benefit in the future. This requires innovative  algorithms and a significant improvement of the hardware. The BMW  Group has decided to engage the global quantum computing community to  help find the best solutions for the immediate future and beyond. The  Quantum Computing Challenge will focus on four specific challenges  where quantum computing could deliver an advantage over classical  computing methods: Registration begins today, and the deadline for submissions is 24  September 2021, after which they will be examined and judged by a  panel of experts. A final event will take place in December 2021,  where the top entrants will have the opportunity to pitch their  solutions to the panel of expert judges. The winners will gain the BMW  Group as a client and will also be involved in the implementation of  the respective pilot projects. AWS is supporting the BMW Group via the Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab,  an expert group of professionals that helped outline the challenge use  cases and who will be on the panel that selects the winners. AWS will  provide credits for entrants to use Amazon Braket to encourage  development and testing of the quantum algorithms submitted. Amazon  Braket provides a development environment for users to explore and  build quantum algorithms, test them on quantum circuit simulators, and  run them on a variety of quantum hardware technologies. “Quantum computing is in its early stages but its long-term impact  promises to be transformational for many industries,” said Bill Vass,  Vice President of Engineering, AWS. “Indeed, enabling cutting edge  research in quantum computing and helping businesses prepare for the  quantum future is why we launched Amazon Braket and built out our team  of experts at the Amazon Quantum Solutions Lab. We’re thrilled to  support BMW and the quantum community in this innovation challenge. We  applaud BMW’s leadership in tackling real industrial challenges where  quantum computers may one day provide an advantage.” BMW Group is driving the creation of a quantum ecosystem.The Quantum Computing Challenge once again underscores how the BMW  Group is playing a leading role in efforts to establish a quantum  ecosystem. As recently as June, the company joined forces with nine  other major corporations to found the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium  (QUTAC). The consortium’s goal is to produce a high quantity of  use cases for industry and, in so doing, create demand for quantum  computing. QUTAC will speed up development of the technology in  Germany and Europe. On 16 June, the BMW Group, together with the Technical University of  Munich (TUM), also announced the creation of an endowed chair in “Quantum Algorithms    and Applications.” Over a period of six years, the BMW Group  will make a fund of €5.1 million available to TUM for a professorship,  equipment and personnel. By taking this step, the BMW Group and TUM  are seeking to bridge the gap between the outstanding basic research  carried out in Germany and its specific application in industry.\n"}

{"prompt":"One day after his first win of the season in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, Maximilian Günther (GER) made an impressive recovery in the Sunday race at the New York City E-Prix (USA).  ->","completion":" New York. One day after his first win of the season in the ABB    FIA Formula E World Championship, Maximilian Günther (GER) made an    impressive recovery in the Sunday race at the New York City E-Prix    (USA). Rain in qualifying meant he had to start from 23rd    on the grid. However, clever strategy and good energy management    allowed him to gradually work his way through the field until he    eventually climbed into tenth place on the final lap. He was    rewarded for his fighting spirit with one point in the Drivers’    Championship. Like Günther, Jake Dennis (GBR) also suffered from the    fact that it started to rain lightly during qualifying group two,    preventing him from setting a fast time. As a result, he also had to    start from near the back of the grid and ultimately crossed the    finish line in 16th place. Starting his recovery from the back of the field, Günther initially  saved energy to use it later on in the race. That worked out well for  him, and he climbed into the top ten on the final lap, as a number of  drivers were powerless to stop him passing them, thanks to the fact  that he had more energy at his disposal. Dennis started the race from  19th and quickly improved to 13th. However, he  fell back down the field because he missed the activation zone for the  attack mode, costing him a lot of time. He eventually had to settle  for 16th place. Günther and Dennis are now 14th  and 15th in the Drivers’ Championship, each with 54 points.  BMW i Andretti Motorsport lies sixth in the Team competition with 108 points. Races 12 and 13 of the season take place in London (GBR) on  24th and 25th July. Reactions to Race 11 in New York. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“After yesterday’s success this was a disappointing day for us. It  all resulted from the misfortune we had in qualifying with the rain.  Anyway, we tried to make the best of it. With Jake we had a slightly  more aggressive strategy than we had with Maximilian’s car. That was  paying off when he had a good start and passed a couple of drivers  ahead of him. Unfortunately, after he had missed the loops of the  attack zone we were on the backfoot. With Maximilian it was more of a  game of patience. We slowly made our way through the field saving a  lot of energy. Then we took our chances where we could and ended up  finishing in P10. A great recovery drive from Maximilian – and who  knows? This one point can make a huge difference at the end of the season.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    19th place, race result: 16th place, points:    54, driver standings: 15th place):“A difficult race after an unfortunate qualifying with the rain  coming down just as we went on track. In the race I was looking strong  and made up a few places at the start. But then I missed the attack  zone, which basically compromised our whole race. Nothing more I could  do. After that, the race was more or less finished. Now I focus on my  home races in London.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    23rd place, race result: 10th place, points:    54, driver standings: 14th place):“It was fun to race my way into the points from the back of the  field. Given the circumstances, I think we had an ideal race with a  very good strategy. We saved a lot of energy at the start and then  gradually worked our way towards the front. It is obviously very  pleasing to have come away with a point.

{"prompt":"The spell has been broken: Maximilian Günther (GER) claimed his first win of the season in race ten of this year’s ABB FIA Formula E World Championship in New York City (USA).  ->","completion":" New York. The spell has been broken: Maximilian Günther (GER)    claimed his first win of the season in race ten of this year’s ABB    FIA Formula E World Championship in New York City (USA). Starting    from fourth place on the grid, he managed his energy extremely well    and was then able to climb from third place into the lead in the    closing laps. This was the third win of Günther’s Formula E career    and his first podium this season. Following Jake Dennis’ (GBR)    triumph at Valencia (ESP), this was win number two of Season 7 for    BMW i Andretti Motorsport. Dennis also had a strong race on his    debut in New York, but unfortunately dropped well down the field    after suffering a puncture, before ultimately retiring. Under the watchful eye of Andretti team owner Michael Andretti (USA),  who was attending a Formula E event for the first time this season at  the home round for his team, Günther drove a very clever and strategic  race. He took the attack modes at exactly the right time and had more  energy at his disposal in the closing stages than his closest rivals.  When Jean-Éric Vergne (FRA, DS Techeetah) attacked the leader Nick  Cassidy (NZL, Envision Virgin Racing) in front of Günther, resulting  in both of them straying from the ideal racing line, the Andretti  driver seized the opportunity to pass both cars on the inside and take  the lead. He then did a great job of guiding the car home to take an  impressive victory. In the Driver’s Championship, Günther has climbed  from 18th to 12th place, courtesy of the 25  points for the win. With 53 points, he now trails Dennis in eleventh  place by just one point. BMW i Andretti Motorsport is now sixth in the  Team standings with 107 points. Dennis started the race from 15th place and battled his  way into the points with some impressive racing. Unfortunately, he  suffered a puncture during a courageous overtaking manoeuvre and had  to come into the pits. That initially dropped him well back through  the field, before he eventually had to retire completely. The eleventh race of the season takes place on Sunday at the same venue. Reactions to Race 10 in New York. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“We couldn’t ask for any more today – a great result for the team.  Super happy for a win here in New York at the home race for BMW i  Andretti Motorsport. Seeing team owner Michael Andretti receive the  trophy on the podium and listen to the US anthem was just great.  Maximilian drove a very strong race from P4 on the grid after yet  another Super Pole appearance. Then he managed a great pass against  Jean-Éric Vergne and Nick Cassidy. I’m very pleased for him. He was on  it today from the first practice session. Jake had an unfortunate day,  first with the red flag that ruined his qualifying. He then drove a  smart race with great overtaking and good use of attack mode and made  it into the points, only to have his race ruined by a cut tyre  following contact.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    15th place, race result: DNF, points: 54, driver    standings: 11th place):“A pretty disappointing day, to be honest. In qualifying we were a  bit out of position with the red flag, but I felt like we could move  forward in the race. Everything was going well, we managed to go up to  ninth and maybe were looking for a top-8 or top-7. But then  unfortunately a car from behind made contact and gave me a puncture.  That’s a shame, but it’s encouraging for tomorrow that we have  definitely one of the fastest cars out there. As a team, we can be  happy with the win today. Well done to Maximilian.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    4th place, race result: 1st place, points: 53,    driver standings: 12th place):“Winning here in New York at the team’s home race is very special,  but it’s also a special victory because of the season we had so far.  Many times things didn’t go our way and we couldn’t score as many  points as we wanted to, but we always kept going and focused on  ourselves. We know what we are capable of. Today we did a good job  managing the race. I had the most energy of all frontrunners left in  the end. That is an advantage, but overtaking still is very difficult  here. Jean-Éric made the move into the hairpin, both race leaders ran  wide and for me that was the perfect opportunity to overtake both.

After reviewing an extensive statement  submitted by the BMW Group, the European Commission has dropped most  of its charges of antitrust violations. With the withdrawal of most of  the original allegations, the Board of Management of BMW AG has agreed  to a settlement proposed by the European Commission that will bring  these proceedings to an end. No suspicion of unlawful defeat devices against the BMW GroupThe following aspect is particularly important to the BMW Group: The  European Commission has once again confirmed that the investigation  concluded with this settlement solely concerned possible infringements  of competition law. The fine notice issued by the European Commission  also states that there is no indication of collusion between the  parties relating to the use of prohibited defeat devices to manipulate  exhaust gas tests. This underlines that there has never been any  allegation of unlawful manipulation of emission control systems by the  BMW Group. Unlike some of its competitors, the BMW Group never considered  reduced, illegal emission control. Discussions had no influence on product decisionsThe fine now issued by the European Commission pertains to  discussions between automotive manufacturers that took place around  ten years ago. From the BMW Group perspective, the talks were aimed at  creating a customer-friendly AdBlue filling infrastructure to support  an effective exhaust gas treatment system. These discussions had no  influence whatsoever on the company’s product decisions. In a Statement of Objections issued in April 2019 in connection with  this antitrust investigation, the European Commission made very  serious allegations against the BMW Group and others. These  allegations mainly centred on two key issues: First, the accusation of  alleged joint development of a software to restrict AdBlue dosing.  Second, the allegation of delaying and\/or preventing development and  rollout of a particle filter for direct-injection petrol engines. In  response to the very serious allegations made at that time, the  company implemented appropriate risk provisioning in April 2019,  recognising a provision of around 1.4 billion euros. Based on a review  of the BMW Group statement, the European Commission dropped the above  allegations relating to AdBlue dosing and the particle filter for  petrol engines. As a consequence, the BMW Group already re-evaluated  its provision on 20 May of this year. This resulted in a positive  effect on earnings of around one billion euros. European Commission enters uncharted territory for antitrust lawThe European Commission acknowledges that the proceedings now  concluded by settlement represent uncharted territory for antitrust  law. Price and territorial agreements were not the subject of this  investigation. The European Commission nevertheless used the standards  generally applied to “classic” cartels of this kind to calculate the  fine – with merely a certain reduction to reflect the unique nature of  the case.Despite the Commission dropping most of its charges, this approach  resulted in a fine of 372.8 million euros. The Board of Management of BMW AG has now accepted this fine in the  current settlement, which acknowledges the excessive transparency  provided in the context of the discussions in question – with regard  to the necessary size of AdBlue tanks, the range that can be achieved  with them and the presumed average AdBlue consumption. From the BMW Group perspective, these discussions were aimed at  creating a customer-friendly AdBlue filling infrastructure, to be  built by the petroleum industry. A marketable filling solution was  crucial to enabling wide-scale use of the highly efficient SCR system for exhaust gas treatment. The discussions were clearly  not held in secret. On the contrary, the aims pursued were openly  communicated to the petroleum industry and within the VDA and ACEA  associations. This was also confirmed by the European Commission. However, excessive transparency, like that during the discussions  between the manufacturers, may also be prohibited under competition  law – even though this transparency did not disadvantage customers in  any way. BMW Group took own approach to exhaust gas treatmentIt became clear during the discussions with the petroleum industry  that the AdBlue filling infrastructure, which was considered necessary  under the conditions at the time, would not be available within the  near future. To avoid any disadvantages this might create for  customers, the BMW Group consistently designed the tank sizes and  ranges of its vehicles to be well above the dimensions agreed in the  working groups. For this purpose, the BMW Group even installed complex  two-tank systems in most vehicles. The European Commission explicitly  recognised this in its decision. The exhaust gas treatment technology used by the BMW Group was  significantly different to its competitors’ solutions from the very  beginning. The BMW Group adopted its own approach, using a combination  of several systems in its diesel vehicles. This included supplementing the SCR emission control systems with an  NOx storage catalytic converter. The result was excellent emissions  performance in real driving conditions and lower AdBlue consumption  than competitor models. In fact, in rolling out its emission control technologies, the BMW  Group was once again fulfilling its aspiration to be an innovation  leader and occupy a leading position among its competitors worldwide  in this area. Applying for leniency not an option for the BMW GroupThe BMW Group made it clear from the start of the antitrust  proceedings that it considered the allegations made at that time to be  exaggerated and unjustified. For this reason, unlike the other  competitors involved, the company did not prematurely admit its guilt  by applying for leniency. Instead, after careful internal preparation  and examination of the substance of the case, a comprehensive  statement was submitted to the European Commission. As a result, the  Commission dropped most of its original allegations against the BMW Group. Comprehensive Compliance Management System ensures responsible    and lawful conductThe BMW Group considers responsible and lawful conduct to be key  elements of its company values and guiding principles worldwide. To  ensure this, the BMW Group relies on a comprehensive Compliance  Management System that is also constantly further developed to reflect  tighter regulatory requirements.    If you have any questions, please contact: Corporate Communications Michael Rebstock, Communications Corporate, Finance, Sales  Email:  michael.rebstock@bmwgroup.com, Telephone: +49 89 382-20470 Eckhard Wannieck, head of Communications Corporate, Finance, SalesEmail: eckhard.wannieck@bmw.de,  Telephone: +49 89 382-24544  Media website: www.press.bmwgroup.comEmail: presse@bmwgroup.com  The BMW Group With its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad, the BMW  Group is the world’s leading premium manufacturer of automobiles and  motorcycles and also provides premium financial and mobility services.

It is particularly pleasing that we  were able to more than double our sales of electrified vehicles,”  continued Nota. With 153,267 units sold in the first half of 2021, the BMW Group grew  its sales of both fully-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles by 148.5  percent year-on-year – making electromobility a major growth driver  for the company in absolute terms as well. Sales of fully electric  vehicles increased by 183.9 percent to a total of 36,089 and plug-in  hybrid vehicles by 139.4 percent to 117,178 units. “We are continuing the decisive electrification of our model line-up  and expanding our range of fully-electric vehicles with two key  innovation flagships: the BMW iX and the BMW i4,” explained  Nota. “The iX and the i4 embody a new era of  electromobility for BMW and I am looking forward to seeing both on the  roads from November. High incoming orders for both models confirm our  customers’ strong interest in these highly emotional vehicles.” In the coming years, these will be joined by further models,  including fully electric versions of the high-volume BMW 5 Series, the  BMW 7 Series, the BMW X1 and the successor to the MINI Countryman.  Between now and 2025, the company plans to increase its sales of  fully-electric models by an average of well over 50 percent per year –  to more than ten times the number of units sold in 2020. The BMW Group  expects fully electric vehicles to account for at least 50 percent of  its global sales in 2030. Over the next ten years or so, the BMW Group  plans to release a total of about ten million fully-electric vehicles  onto the roads.  Semiconductor situation remains difficultThe BMW Group has made individual adjustments to its production  programme to take account of the availability of semiconductor  components. The company expects the supply situation for semiconductor  components to remain difficult and cannot rule out the possibility of  this impacting sales during the rest of the year.  BMW sales up more than a third In the first half of this year, 1,178,292 BMW  vehicles (+39.9%) were delivered to customers worldwide. The top  performers included the high-volume BMW 3 Series, with growth of  almost 50 percent (+49.1%). This confirms the strong appeal of this  model series, which has enjoyed considerable success for more than  four decades. With sales growth of 33.3 percent, the BMW 5 Series  underlined its strong position in the upper mid-size premium segment.  Sales of the BMW X3, which comes with four drive train variants,  climbed 43.9 percent in the first six months of the year. The fully  electric iX3*, in particular, gave sales a significant boost.  MINI brand grows sales by almost a third in first half-yearIn the first six months of 2021, the MINI brand sold  a total of 157,799 vehicles worldwide (+32.6%), growing its sales in  all regions of the world. The brand's electrified models proved  especially popular with customers. Together, the fully electric MINI  SE* and the plug-in hybrid variant of the MINI Countryman* accounted  for more than 15 percent of the brand’s total sales volumes for the  first half year. BMW M GmbH posts strong sales for YTD Q2With year-on-year sales growth of +39.4 percent (83,357 units),  BMW M GmbH reported its most successful first  half-year ever. The M3 and M4, which have been available since March,  as well as the X5 M and X6 M, made a significant contribution to this  all-time sales high. In the Performance Segment, the M440i Coupé* is  driving growth. The new M440i Convertible* launched in March is  another major contributor to this success, along with consistently  high volumes for the M340i Sedan* and Touring* models. Thanks to strong global demand for all its models,    Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was able to sell 2,989  (+91.6%) vehicles in the first half of 2021, almost double the figure  for the previous year. The introduction of the successor to the Ghost  in late 2020 also contributed greatly to sales growth in the first six  months of this year. The company remains optimistic for the rest of  the year. BMW Motorrad: Best-ever first half-year confirms brand's    successful growth strategyIn the first six months of 2021, BMW Motorrad delivered 107,610  motorcycles and scooters to customers (+40,3%). With its best-ever  sales result for a first half-year, BMW Motorrad impressively  underpinned its successful growth strategy by continuing to build on  the all-time sales high of the first quarter. This success relies on a  strong product offering with a wide range of different models,  including no fewer than eight new models released onto the market in  the first six months of the year. With today’s world premiere of the  all-new fully electric BMW CE 04, BMW Motorrad is expanding its  product portfolio to offer entirely new options for urban  emission-free mobility. BMW & MINI sales in the regions\/marketsThe BMW Group continued its strong performance in  China, growing its sales by 41.9 percent to 467,064  units in the first half of the year. A total of 42,502 vehicles were  sold in the key Asian market of South Korea in the  first six months of the year – an increase of +34.6 percent compared  to the same period of 2020. In the US, the company was able to build on the  sales success of the first quarter and, with a total of 183,619 units  sold in the first six months, sales of BMW and MINI vehicles climbed  by more than 50 percent year-on-year (+51.8%). Europe also had a successful first half-year, with  sales increasing by a third (+35.3%). Total BMW and MINI sales for the  region reached 504,327 vehicles. With 141,983 new vehicle registrations in its domestic market of  Germany, BMW Group sales were 22.1 percent higher  year-on-year. The percentage of electrified vehicles continues to  climb and nearly one in four BMWs in Germany is now electrified. The  fully electric MINI SE* represented more than 19 percent of total MINI  sales in the first half of 2021. This means almost 30 percent of newly  registered MINI models in Germany are electrified.   2nd Quarter 2021 Compared with previous year %1st Half 2021 Compared with previous year %BMW Group Automotive 702,474+44.6%1,339,080+39.1%BMW 617,749+43.5%1,178,292+39.9%MINI 83,116+52.2%157,799+32.6%BMW Group electrified* 83,060+166.9%153,267+148.5%Rolls-Royce 1,609+127.6%2,989+91.6%BMW Motorrad65,018+55.1%107,610+40.3%*BEVs and PHEVs  2nd Quarter 2021 Compared with previous year %1st Half 2021 Compared with previous year %Europe265,566+74.9%504,327+35.3%74,044+53.3%141,983+22.1%Asia291,891+15.1%578,859+39.1%237,316+11.6%467,064+41.9%Americas128,264+82.4%224,225+47.4%105,901+88.3%183,619+51.8%*Provisional registration figures The delivery figures reported in this press release are provisional  and may change up until the Half-Year Report to 30 June 2021 is  published.

{"prompt":"New design feature, unique in the competitive environment, is offered for the MINI 3-door, the MINI 5-door and the MINI Clubman. Innovative painting process at the MINI plant in Oxford enables a three-colour design of the roof, which sets visual accents in the typical style of the British premium brand. ->","completion":" Munich. MINI has a long tradition of colour  diversity. A contrasting paint finish for the roof once helped the  classic Mini to achieve a particularly expressive appearance and has  continued to set attractive visual accents in various colour tones  since the launch of the modern MINI 20 years ago. With the exclusive  Multitone Roof, the individualisation of the MINI exterior achievable  by means of paintwork now reaches a whole new dimension. For the first  time, an innovative wet-on-wet painting process is being used at the  MINI plant in Oxford, UK, to create a three-colour design for the  vehicle roof.The pioneer for the innovative form of roof design is the MINI Cooper  SE (power consumption combined: 17.6 - 15.2 kWh\/100 km according to  WLTP, 16.9 - 14.9 kWh\/100 km according to NEDC). For the first time,  the Multitone Roof was offered as part of the MINI Electric Collection  for the British premium brand's all-electric model, which was  presented alongside the world premiere of the latest new edition of  MINI's small car models. In the meantime, the Multitone Roof, which is  unique worldwide in the mass production of automobiles, is available  as an optional extra for both the premium small cars MINI 3-door and  MINI 5-door as well as for the MINI Clubman, which is successful in  the premium compact segment.The visual highlight of the new design feature is the flowing  gradient between the three colour tones selected for the Multitone  Roof. From the dark San Marino Blue in the front section of the  vehicle's roof, the colour scheme gently transitions to the lighter  shade of Pearly Aqua, then just as smoothly to Jet Black in the rear  section. The unique aesthetic created by this colour gradient is also  easily recognisable in conjunction with the optional panoramic glass  roof as well as the optional roof rails. The colour scheme of the  Multitone Roof forms an interplay that is as appealing as it is  harmonious with almost all the body paint finishes available for the  MINI 3-door, the MINI 5-door and the MINI Clubman. It is therefore  available in combination with all exterior colours with the exception  of the Chili Red uni and British Racing Green metallic variants as  well as the Indian Summer Red metallic available for the MINI Clubman.With the contrasting paint for the roof, the characteristic  three-part division of the MINI body is emphasised particularly  intensively. The horizontal structure of vehicle body, glass passenger  cell and roof is a design principle typical of the brand. The design  of the roof becomes an expression of personal style. Depending on the  model variant, contrasting paint finishes in white, black and silver  are offered as optional equipment ex works. A red-painted roof is also  available for the John Cooper Works models. In addition, the MINI  Original Accessories range includes roof decors in various designs -  from the Union Jack to the Checkered Flag design - for retrofitting.The expansion of the range of contrasting paint finishes to include  the Multitone Roof is made possible by the introduction of a new type  of painting technique at the British MINI plant in Oxford. There, the  light colour Pearly Aqua is first applied to the roof of the  correspondingly configured vehicles. In further steps, San Marino Blue  is applied to the front of the roof and Jet Black to the rear,  creating the flowing colour gradients characteristic of the Multitone  Roof. The innovative painting process is fully integrated into the  automated production process at the MINI plant in Oxford.  Nevertheless, slight deviations in the colour pattern occur due to  changing environmental conditions, so that each MINI with a Multitone  Roof is already given the character of a unique specimen by the  painting process at the factory . In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product  Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com Fuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption were    measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC)    2007\/715 as amended.

{"prompt":"In our preview, we present the most important facts and key factors of the New York City E-Prix. ->","completion":" Munich. After two successful races in Mexico, BMW i Andretti    Motorsport will be competing in the tenth and eleventh races of the    season in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship at the New York    City E-Prix (USA) this coming weekend. On its previous appearance at    the Brooklyn circuit, the team celebrated a pole position and two    podiums to round off Season 5. As was the case then, the Manhattan    skyline will once again provide a wonderful backdrop for the two    races that will take place. Jake Dennis (GBR) and Maximilian Günther    (GER) will take the momentum from their strong performances in    Puebla (MEX) into the weekend. They are in eighth and 18th positions    in the drivers’ standings with 54 and 28 points, while BMW i    Andretti Motorsport is seventh in the team championship with 82    points. The two regular drivers will be joined in New York by BMW    works driver Philipp Eng (AUT), who will be available as a reserve    driver. Eng has received his FIA E-Licence and will also assume this    role until the end of the season in London (GBR) and Berlin (GER).    In our preview, we present the most important facts and key factors    of the New York City E-Prix. You can find detailed information in our media guide: https:\/\/b.mw\/Formula_E_Media_Guide.  It provides detailed information on the technology behind the BMW i  drivetrain and the BMW iFE.21, background stories on the technology  transfer between motor racing and production development, the BMW i  Andretti Motorsport Team and the drivers as well as the BMW Group  safety car fleet.

Significant            improvement in grip expected between qualifying groups.Track layoutSimilar to layout from Season 5.            Mix of slow, medium-fast and few fast turns. Some good            overtaking opportunities. Primarily T6 and T10. T14 to            start\/finish is very fast, difficult to follow, therefore no            ideal overtaking opportunity in T1.Tyre wearRelatively high, especially on            rear tyres.Top speedApprox. 220 km\/h before T1.Attack zoneNew position on outside of T10.

Also high            probability of losing places.Key factorsEnergy management, temperature            management if the weather is hot, good grid position to            steer clear of potential midfield collisions. Quotes ahead of the New York City E-Prix: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“The BMW i Andretti Motorsport team heads to one of two home events;  this one for the Andretti organisation with the double header in New  York City. The track is familiar to the team and on the last visit  produced a strong result with double podiums and a pole position. We  know from the past there can be a reasonable evolution in the track  conditions through qualifying and so our qualifying groups two and  three should bode well for us. One of the bigger challenges for the  team is the anticipated higher temperatures for this time of year in  the New York area; this will mean that monitoring the RESS temperature  during the race will be critical. After the double points scoring  finish in Mexico for the team, we will be hoping for a repeat. That  will be key to a successful outcome in the championship standings.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21):“I have been looking forward to this event since the race calendar  was published. I’ve always wanted to go there since I was a kid, but  I’d never made it. I can hardly wait to see the Statue of Liberty and  the Brooklyn Bridge and to race in such a cool part of New York. I am  sure that the double-header weekend will be very intense but I hope  that we can build on our good performances in Puebla and get involved  in the battle for the top three in the drivers’ championship.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21):“Looking at the whole season, the races in New York are definitely  some of the most special ones. Racing in front of that skyline gives  the weekend that certain something. The circuit is superb, we have  prepared well and I feel ready to have some fun in the Big Apple.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

A good Saturday was followed by a great Sunday    at Donington Park (GBR).

In the    morning’s Superpole race, Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark    (NED) finished second and third to record a double podium, while    Sykes finished third in the afternoon’s second main race to reach    the rostrum once again. Van der Mark crossed the finish line in a    good fifth place. Donington Park hosted round four of the 2021    WorldSBK season.  The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team had laid the foundations for Sunday’s  success in Superpole qualifying on Saturday, as van der Mark and Sykes  began the Superpole race in the morning from second and third places  on the grid. Rain showers made a brief appearance before the sprint  race but the circuit dried out quickly. In common with much of the  field, both BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team riders went with intermediate  tyres. They both initially dropped back by one place on the first lap  but regained those positions on lap two and did not surrender them  thereafter. After ten laps, Sykes finished second and van der Mark  third to secure not just the first WorldSBK podium for the new M RR,  but a double podium finish. As the Superpole race decided the grid for race two that afternoon,  they had a great start position with both riders back on the front row  again, Sykes in second and van der Mark in third. Sykes exited the  first turns in third place, staying in touch with leading duo Jonathan  Rea (GBR \/ Kawasaki) and Toprak Razgatlioglu (TUR \/ Yamaha). Sykes  dropped back to fourth place for a short while around the halfway  point of the race, but the BMW rider moved back to third after a fall  for leader Rea. He then defended until the chequered flag was waved  after 23 laps - celebrating his second podium finish of the day. Van  der Mark lost ground at the start but moved back into fifth place on  lap 16 to secure another top five finish. Eugene Laverty (IRL) crossed the finish line in twelfth place in the  Superpole race on the BMW M 1000 RR of BMW satellite team RC Squadra  Corse. He finished 15th in race two, scoring another world  championship point. Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team  Bonovo MGM Racing claimed 16th place in the morning’s sprint race. He  then retired early from the afternoon race as the quickshifter did not  work properly. Quotes after race two at Donington Park. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  are very happy. It’s very good to get this under the belt, it takes  away a bit of the pressure when we focus on the next rounds. As I said  yesterday, there is still some work to do. I was hoping for some rain  today but it didn’t come in the afternoon. So it was very, very good  to confirm our performance in a full dry race on slicks as we were  definitely not as competitive in such conditions in the last race and  also at the beginning of this weekend. Overall, to come away with  three podiums is of course very, very pleasing. This is something we  can build on. Crucial for this weekend was definitely our Superpole  qualifying because if you look at the pace of the others you know that  you could easily be sixth, seventh or eighth if you are not in that  front row. Now it’s time to settle down, look at the data, gather our  thoughts and make the next step.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It was a fantastic day. It’s our home track, the home round  for Tom and us, so it was a sensational day for all. I think we  stepped up. We’ve come back from a really disappointing Misano round,  we have reacted. In the sprint race, there were changeable conditions  and almost everyone went for intermediate tyres which was the right  decision. Then in race two, with dry conditions, all started on slicks  and it shows the step we have made with the BMW M 1000 RR. We were  literally a few seconds off the win. We always were in contention for  the podium and Tom did a fantastic race and Michael was not far behind  him. He withstood the pressure from Alex Lowes on the Kawasaki and  brought the bike home in a strong fifth. Now we all are looking  forward to Michael’s home round at Assen.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “Credit to the  whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. We have come here, tried to just  assess the situation after the Navarra test and really, I am happy. I  was training at the beginning of the week and when I came to my house  and got off my pushbike, I knew: this is the weekend. Considering what  we learned at Navarra I would be going to drag the thing around  Donington Park if I have to. On Friday, I was pushing the boundaries  and went to the deck twice. Normally I ride to the limit and stop just  like I did today in the race. The guys did an incredible job, giving  me a perfect bike in terms of what we had available in our tool box so  I think we got the best from our package this weekend. Still, we need  to improve but this is a whole confidence boost for the team and me.  It gives everyone what they deserve. And what’s really nice is that we  had two BMWs, myself and Michael, on the front row in wet conditions  and then with the intermediates in tricky conditions, we were on the  podium again - both BMWs, second and third. Then in that last race, it  was tricky in the beginning but ultimately a dry race on a different  rear tyre. I am not really sure if I am happy with the tyre I chose  but we dug deep and the tyre gave us a podium so for this I am happy.  Hopefully now we can continue with the information we have and try to  keep improving.”                                                          Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We  had a really good Sunday. It was nice this morning in the Superpole  race. The track was a little bit tricky so early everyone went on  intermediates and it was the right choice. I really enjoyed it. It was  good to finish on the podium together with Tom. Then in race two I had  quite a good feeling but I just struggled too much in changing  directions; I lost a lot of time there compared to the other guys. But  in the end, we finished fifth so we have a lot of valuable points and  it was nice to have Tom on the podium again.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “It was a pretty  difficult weekend here at Donington Park. I had high hopes for here  because I know the character of the BMW M 1000 RR is well suited to  the majority of the flowing Donington track but we never had a good  feeling this weekend. That has been the case with the bike since my  big crash at Misano so now we have to investigate if there is some  damage from the bike from the crash that hasn’t still been recognized  because it’s impossible to be so slow this weekend when we see what  the official BMWs were doing. We should be there together with them.  So let’s investigate and come back stronger.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was a difficult  weekend and I am sorry for the entire team that we find ourselves in  this situation. Right now, we are searching for solutions that we have  not yet been able to find. I hope that things will improve soon and we  can make progress.” \n"}

The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team gave a strong    performance to start off the fourth event of the season in the 2021    FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) at Donington Park (GBR).    In Superpole on Saturday morning, Michael van der Mark (NED) and Tom    Sykes (GBR) claimed second and third places on their BMW M 1000 RRs    to secure spots on the front row of the grid. Both riders crossed    the finish line in the top five in the afternoon’s first race. Sykes    was in fourth and van der Mark in fifth. The weather at Donington Park took a typically British turn on  Saturday morning. Rain set in for the second free practice session in  the morning and the circuit was still moist for Superpole. That did  not prevent van der Mark and Sykes from recording some impressive  times to keep pace with the leaders, putting both BMW Motorrad  WorldSBK Team BMW M 1000 RRs on the front row of the grid. The rain had stopped by the time the race started in the afternoon  and the circuit was gradually drying. Van der Mark and Sykes were able  to defend second and third positions after the start lights went out.  They swapped places twice in the opening stage, before settling into  third (van der Mark) and fourth (Sykes) until the halfway point of the  race. Both were part of a group battling for the lead on lap twelve,  but then van der Mark had light contact with Alex Lowes (GBR \/  Kawasaki), ran wide and fell back to sixth place. Sykes initially  moved into third place before crossing the line in fourth, immediately  ahead of fifth-placed van der Mark, after 23 laps. Eugene Laverty (IRL), competing for the BMW satellite team RC Squadra  Corse, secured 15th place on the grid in Superpole. Laverty had moved  up to twelfth by the halfway point of the race. He then dropped down  one place in the closing stage and took the chequered flag in 13th  position. Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM  Racing endured a difficult Saturday. He started from 20th place and  then problems when changing gear forced him to head for the pits and  retire just before the end of the race. Quotes after race one at Donington Park. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Overall, we are very happy after an extremely difficult  Misano weekend. At the same time, we need to keep our feet on the  ground as there is still quite a big gap to the very front. But for  sure, second and third places in qualifying were well deserved with  strong performances of both Michael and Tom in the wet. Of course, we  would have hoped for a podium as the first half of the race looked  like it but we just couldn’t keep that. To bring home fourth and fifth  is definitely satisfying. Tomorrow is another day and we start again  from the front row of the grid. It looks like it will rain tomorrow  but if we can repeat what we did today I would be very pleased with  the weekend.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We were glad first of all that it was a slick race for  everybody. We would rather be it be totally wet or totally dry. We  were at a good level, and we could show the progress we have made with  the new BMW M 1000 RR. We can’t be disappointed with fourth and fifth;  we equalled our best result as a team from Aragón. For sure we would  have liked to go one step further but the guys gave their best. We got  a lot of information that we can take into tomorrow. Obviously, we  start from the same grid positions into the Superpole race and if all  goes well we can get that step closer to the podium and keep  progressing the development of the BMW M 1000 RR.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am  definitely happy that the BMW M 1000 RR was working well in the full  wet conditions. In that in-between condition at the beginning of the  race, we just struggled to get into it. We could not get the same grip  as everyone else but the bike stayed very, very consistent so we were  just missing a couple of tenths. We did not have a full dry set-up.  Who would have thought that the sun comes out? So we maybe missed out  in that respect but fourth position is not too bad. I’m okay with that  and obviously we will try to improve tomorrow.”                                                          Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Today was not bad. In Superpole, on the wet track, I felt  really good and we managed to put both BMWs on the front row. That’s  always a good thing. For the race, the track started to slowly dry. My  start was quite okay and then I was just trying to find my line. I was  making a couple of mistakes going down to Craner Curves, going onto  the wet with the slicks so I lost a lot of time there a couple of  times. That was a bit of a shame but anyway, there is a lot to improve  on the bike for sure for tomorrow but I think we can be satisfied with  P5 today.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “In the race, the  conditions dried up and unfortunately, while I went with dry tyres we  weren’t able to change to the dry setting. So in the end I was riding  with a wet suspension setting and it was impossible to do good lap  times. That was the maximum I could do today, so hopefully tomorrow it  is either clearly wet or clearly dry because when it is like that,  there isn’t time to change and it’s a bit difficult for a smaller team  like us. But, we start again tomorrow.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “There’s not much to  say today. I just didn’t feel right today. Now we have to find out  what caused that. We can only hope that it goes better tomorrow.” \n"}

{"prompt":"BMW Group congratulates Eckart Witzigmann on his birthday  Symposium  “What does sustainability taste like?“ online available  ECKART 2021 awarded to a pioneering project  ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group and „Chef of the Century”  Eckart Witzigmann have been allied in their shared commitment to the  art of cooking, deliberate consumption and social responsibility for a  long time. This year, the BMW Group will honour its companion of many  years on the occasion of his important anniversary and present the  jubilarian with a unusual gift – a ECKART Symposium. Following the  theme “What does sustainability taste like?“ a series of several panel  debates featuring first-class experts will focus on important  questions of our time. Ilka Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management at BMW AG, Human  Resources and Labour Relations Director, commented on the special  anniversary, „Happy birthday, dear Mr Witzigmann! Our symposium is  just a little token of our appreciation to mark our long-standing  partnership. From its inception, we have kept in mind our common goal,  namely the promotion of healthy eating, sustainable culinary art and  responsible use of resources and continue to work towards it to this  day. Good, healthy food that is produced and prepared in a sustainable  manner is one of the greatest challenges of our time. A challenge that  reflects how we at the BMW Group understand and live sustainability.  New impulses are key to company catering and fine dining alike. Hand  in hand, we are developing and promoting ideas to ensure real change.  I would like to express my most sincere gratitude to Mr Witzigmann for  his continued commitment to the cause.” Hosted by Dr Christoph Wirtz, editor in chief at restaurant guide  Gault&Millau Germany, the very first interdisciplinary round table  on quality and sustainability will be a platform for debate welcoming  participants head of human resources Ilka Horstmeier, Norbert  Niederkofler, winner of the ECKART 2020 for innovation and Steffi  Czerny, CEO DLD Media GmbH. “Quality” has an interesting double  meaning. Used in its literal sense, the term denotes the sum of all  qualities of any given product. As users, however, we tend to  interpret the term as having a value and attach it to upmarket and  premium products. If we furthermore combine the term “quality” with  the idea of sustainability, we also bring into question its origin,  the way it was produced and the social conditions surrounding its  production, its transport and sale as well as its final use and  processing. The same is true for food products and vehicles and even  digital products. At the roundtable, the participants will explore at  what point food and other products can be considered sustainable and  what exactly that implies. And if sustainability is to be understood  as the basis of new, circular business activities, there is a need to  develop new business models. In the next panel Martin Straubinger, head of BMW Group Company  Catering, Barbara Jung-Arntz, journalist, and Jürgen Mäder, CEO Edeka  Südwest, will debate a range of issues including transport routes,  distribution, quality and cost of our food. Mr Straubinger said, “In  line with our overall strategy regarding sustainability at the BMW  Group, the department of company catering is a proactive agent in the  process and continuously improves its relevant practices. To that end,  we routinely examine all processes such as the local sourcing of  products, animal welfare, the optimisation of delivery routes and the  use of sustainable materials as well as the reduction and prevention  of waste. No small feat, keeping in mind the enormous number of meals  – 42,000 – that cross our counters every day at the various BMW  locations in both Germany and Austria.” The third panel will feature Jürgen Molter, head of catering at the  BMW sites in Dingolfing, Regensburg, Landshut and Steyr, Nathalie  Leblond, head chef at restaurant “Les Deux”, Dr Stefan Hartmann,  president of the German Institute of Company Catering (DIG) and  Patrick Auer, head of company catering at the Bavarian Association of  Insurers debating the similarities and differences of fine dining and  company catering. What expectations do they need to meet respectively  and what can the two disciplines learn from each other? At the end of  the day, fine dining is most appreciated where people make the choice  of eating both healthy and well and where most meals cross the counter  – at staff canteens. In the final panel, Maximilian Schöberl,  Head of BMW Group Corporate and Intergovernmental Affairs, and Eckart  Witzigmann will talk about a future collaboration close to their heart  launched on the occasion of the 80th birthday of the “Chef  of the Century”. Donated by the ECKART Academy, named after the  century chef Eckart Witzigmann, and endowed with a prize money of  50,000 Euro by the BMW Group, the ECKART 2021 will be awarded to a  pioneering project. The project was co-founded by the oncological  center of excellence Klinik Bad Trissl, a major partner of Munich’s  universities as well as Bavaria’s leading treatment center for tumor  patients and Munich’s most awarded chef Jan Hartwig. Together, they  harness their expertise in fine dining to develop healthy diets for  both patients and staff. To give an initial boost to the project, Prof Dr Volkmar Nüssler  (MD), Executive Coordinator at Munich Tumor Centre (TMZ), responsible  for the medical side of “Proof of Concept”, will provide scientific  support while the business side of the project will be headed by  Prof Dr Nicole Graf, Chancellor of DHBW university. The symposium will be recorded prior to the  80th anniversary of Eckart Witzigmann and made available  online at https:\/\/eckart-foodlab.com. The ECKARTThe BMW Group and ECKART Academy have been partners since 2012 and  together they award the Eckart Witzigmann Prize for outstanding  achievements in the field of gastronomy.

{"prompt":"Highest standards of flexibility: All drive train variants on one line  Successful transformation of BMW Group plants towards e-mobility and digitalisation  Half of Dingolfing's production volume will be electrified by mid-decade  Nedeljković: “setting ourselves ambitious goals for the most sustainable production” ->","completion":" Highest standards of flexibility: All drive train variants on one  line  Successful transformation of BMW Group plants towards  e-mobility and digitalisation  Half of Dingolfing's production  volume will be electrified by mid-decade  Nedeljković: “setting  ourselves ambitious goals for the most sustainable production” Dingolfing. Standard production of the fully-electric  BMW iX* began today in Dingolfing. The plant in Lower Bavaria now  produces vehicles with all drive train variants, i.e.  combustion-engine vehicles, plug-in hybrids and fully-electric models,  on a single line. Milan Nedeljković, member of the Board of Management  of BMW AG, responsible for Production: “The launch of the BMW iX*  marks another milestone in our expansion of electrification and  demonstrates our production network's successful transformation  towards electromobility and digitalisation.” The BMW iX* is being manufactured at the BMW Group’s largest European  production plant on an assembly line with the flexibility to build a  mix of BMW 5 Series, 7 Series and 8 Series models. To handle this  flexibility and variety of drive trains, vehicle assembly in  Dingolfing has been expanded and refurbished. The BMW Group has  invested a total of more than 400 million euros in producing the BMW  iX* at the Dingolfing vehicle plant. Many of the remodelling and  structural measures required for the BMW iX* are already benefiting  future generations of the BMW 7 Series and 5 Series that will come off  the production line in Dingolfing in the coming years. Fully-electric  variants have also been announced for both model ranges. Half of production volume already electrified by mid-decadeWith the BMW iX* and other PHEV models at Plant Dingolfing alone, the  BMW Group plans to double the percentage of electrified vehicles  produced this year compared to 2020. By the middle of the decade, half  the vehicles produced in Dingolfing will be electrified. The new model  will play an important part in this. “The BMW iX* will already be one  of the highest-volume model at the location by next year,” according  to Nedeljković. The BMW iX* will be followed in the autumn by the BMW  i4*, which will be built in Munich. At the end of next year, all  German plants will be producing at least one fully-electric vehicle. Broad know-how: Vehicle and e-drive production on siteProduction of the BMW iX* in Dingolfing benefits from broad know-how  and expertise in the technologies located at the site. Close  interaction between these different areas enables a high level of  in-house activity and short lines of communication, as well as  ensuring optimum production technology overall. The fully-electric  heart of the BMW iX* – the highly integrated e-drive and  fifth-generation battery, as well as the complete electric axle are  produced on site, together with the Dingolfing component plants.  Production capacity will be systematically expanded and, from 2022,  Dingolfing will be able to produce e-drives for more than half a  million electrified vehicles. BMW iX* as trailblazer The BMW iX* introduces a multitude of innovations to the product and  production processes at the plant – especially in the vehicle’s  electrical system architecture, software, digital services,  connectivity and automated driving functions. As a result, the vehicle  plays an important role as a trailblazer and is making Dingolfing  “e-car” and “smart-car ready” as the BMW Group’s primary plant for the  luxury class. The BMW iX* is also an important trailblazer in production, bringing  future technologies into the production system – such as digital  methods for employee training, automation of logistics processes,  virtual commissioning and validation of driver assistance systems. Christoph Schröder, head of BMW Group Plant Dingolfing: “As the  primary plant for the luxury class, our location produces the BMW  Group’s technology flagship. It is once again proving itself as a  pioneer for the mobility of tomorrow and as the industry leader in key  future areas of automotive activity, such as electrification,  digitalisation and sustainability. In this way, the BMW iX* is  continuing the successful transformation of the BMW Group location in  Dingolfing that began long ago.” Special focus on sustainabilityThe topic of sustainability is firmly anchored throughout the  company. A particular focus is on improving our carbon footprint –  especially in production of electric vehicles. Independent auditors  have confirmed that the greenhouse gas potential of the BMW iX  xDrive40* is around 45 percent lower than that of a comparable Sports  Activity Vehicle with an internal combustion engine. “We are already  the sustainability benchmark for our industry. But we will continue to  invest in resource-saving technologies and set ourselves ambitious  goals for the most sustainable production,” underlined head of  Production Milan Nedeljković. The BMW Group takes a holistic approach  to reducing CO2 emissions and minimising resource  consumption that covers the entire value chain, including production  as well as the supply chain and use phase. The BMW Group has already succeeded in lowering resource consumption  per vehicle produced by more than half between 2006 and 2020.  CO2 emissions have been reduced even more significantly –  by as much as 78 percent. The aim is to reduce CO2  emissions per vehicle produced by another 80 percent by 2030. “To  achieve this, we have made some changes at Plant Dingolfing and  implemented a series of new measures,” says plant director Christoph  Schröder. For example, the BMW iX* is produced exclusively using  regional and directly sourced green power from two hydroelectric power  plants located on the Isar and Lech rivers. The entire plant, like all  BMW Group locations, will also be net carbon neutral from this year,  through the use of corresponding offsets and certificates. Other aspects of sustainability range from energy-efficient  installations to packaging planning, through transport logistics and  recycling, up to and including topics such as biodiversity and water  management. Plant Dingolfing is therefore able to achieve a recycling  rate of more than 90 percent and an even higher recoverability rate of  over 99 percent. The plant’s own wells meet over 40 percent of its  water needs, thereby helping conserve the region’s drinking water  reserves. The BMW Group has already reduced its water consumption by  more than 30 percent overall since 2006. BMW iX* as catalyst for change: Active shift in competence. The BMW iX* creates a need for additional training beyond the  extensive experience and expertise that is already available. It is  accelerating the shift in competence already taking place within the  production network and helping prepare the workforce for the demands  of a new era. In this way, employee development across the entire  company is being geared towards digitalisation and e-mobility. As part  of the biggest training offensive in the company’s history, 75,000  staff are being trained in future areas of activity. In Dingolfing alone, more than 4,000 employees have moved to jobs  with strong future prospects since 2012. A current example of this is  the creation and expansion of the Competence Centre for E-Drive  Production at the location, which doubled its staff numbers last year  from 600 to 1,200. This number is likely to increase to over 1,900 by  the end of the year.  \n"}

One year has passed since Alessandro Zanardi (ITA)    suffered severe injuries in a handbike accident in Italy in June    2020. It has been a year in which the BMW brand ambassador is once    more showing his fighting spirit and is working his way back, even    if it is a long way. In this interview, his wife Daniela Zanardi    reports on his recovery process.  Daniela, how is Alex these days? Daniela Zanardi: “One year after the accident, Alex’s condition is  essentially stable. He is currently in a special clinic, where he is  undergoing a rehabilitation programme. This includes multimodal and  pharmacological stimulations under the guidance of doctors,  physiotherapists, neuropsychologists and speech therapists to try to  facilitate his recovery.” A long time has passed since the last update on Alex’s health.    Is there a specific reason for this release? Zanardi: “We have received so many best wishes for his recovery, and  I would like to take this opportunity to say a big thank you, on  behalf of Alex, for every single message. Following consultations with  the doctors, now appears to be an appropriate time to offer this small  insight into Alex’s recovery process with this interview. I would like  to tell all those people who are thinking of and praying for Alex that  he is fighting – as he always has done. The affection we have received  from friends, fans, acquaintances, athletes and those involved in  motorsport over the past year has been nothing short of touching and  overwhelming and has been of enormous support for us in dealing with  all this. However, a very special thank you goes to the medical personnel.” How can you describe Alex’s development since the accident? Zanardi: “It has been a very complex process that has required more  neurosurgery and been characterised by a number of setbacks. Alex is  in a stable condition, which means he is able to undergo training  programmes for both his brain and his body. He can communicate with  us, but he is still unable to speak. After a long time in a coma, the  vocal cords must regain their elasticity. This is only possible  through practice and therapy. He still has a lot of strength in his  arms and hands, and is training intensively on the equipment.” What are your expectations for the future? Zanardi: “It is certainly another huge challenge. It is a very long  journey and at the moment no predictions are made on when he will be  able to return home. We put all our energy in Alex’s recovery.  Therefore we decided to use this interview as a unique opportunity to  inform the public on his recovery status and answer some frequently  asked questions. We appreciate everyone’s understanding that we will  leave it at that for the moment.” \n"}

A giant temporary stage in Trafalgar  Square will host Sir Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra  with young musicians from the pioneering LSO East London Academy and  14-year-old violinist Leia Zhu for the free BMW CLASSICS concert on    Sunday 15 August 2021 at 6.30pm.This year marks the 10th anniversary of the partnership between BMW  and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the beginning of a further  three-year partnership bringing access to world leading music to  everyone in one of London’s most iconic public spaces. The audience in  Trafalgar Square will be joined by thousands more watching the live  stream on YouTube bringing music lovers across the globe together. Sir Simon Rattle will take to the stage to conduct musicians of all  ages with the London Symphony Orchestra, alongside 20 young musicians  from the LSO East London Academy and British-Chinese teenage violin  prodigy Leia Zhu, guest soloist for Saint-Saëns’ great violin  showpiece “Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso”.The programme features music on a theme of dance and ballet with  Dvořák’s “Slavonic Dances”, and Tchaikovsky’s “The Nutcracker” in  addition to the first live performance of Ayanna  Witter-Johnson’s “DreamCity”.Commenting today, Sir Simon Rattle said, “This year  will be extra special. 2020’s concert was a casualty of the pandemic  and we have shifted our date to August in the hope that social  distancing guidelines will have eased some more so we can gather  together as an orchestra and with a crowd and have a great musical  summer party. I am delighted that the musicians from the LSO East  London Academy are joining us on stage, along with the soaring talent  that is Leia Zhu. These young people are the future and it is  awe-inspiring to see their talent develop, and share their gifts with  the crowd in Trafalgar Square and on YouTube. I am truly grateful to  BMW and Sadiq Khan as Mayor for London for making this possible.”The BMW CLASSICS programme is staged as part of the Mayor of London’s  ‘Let’s Do London’ campaign, showcasing London as a world class  creative capital. The biggest domestic tourism campaign the capital  has ever seen is encouraging Londoners and visitors to come back to  the city and take advantage of London’s public spaces and cultural riches.Dr. Nicolas Peter, Member of the Board of Management of BMW  AG: “I am absolutely delighted that our successful  partnership of the London Symphony Orchestra and BMW will be extended  for another three years. Our commitment in the field of classical  music is an integral part of our 50-year long worldwide cultural  engagement. I am very much looking forward to experiencing the  open-air concert again and seeing Sir Simon Rattle and all the  musicians back on stage.”“I’m delighted that Sir Simon Rattle and the London Symphony  Orchestra will return to Trafalgar Square this August to put on a free  concert alongside young London musicians. Outdoor classical concerts  are a great way to enjoy music, and this performance will be a real  treat. It’s a highlight of my Let’s Do London domestic tourism  campaign, which is welcoming people back to safely enjoy the amazing  culture on offer in London”, said the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.Composer Ayanna Witter-Johnson: “’DreamCity’ was a  fantastic collaborative project for me; it was a total joy working  with these incredibly talented and dedicated young musicians from East  London. Initially conceived as a short film project, I am thrilled  that the LSO have decided to give the piece another life and that the  young musicians alongside the LSO will be giving ‘DreamCity’ it’s very  first live performance.” BMW CLASSICSLondon Symphony  OrchestraSunday 15 August 2021 at 6.30pmTrafalgar Square, LondonFeaturing music from Dvořák’s “Slavonic Dances”, Tchaikovsky’s “The  Nutcracker”, Saint-Saën’s “Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso” and the  first live performance of “DreamCity” by Ayanna Witter-Johnson.For the audiences around the world, the concert will be available to  watch on the YouTube  channel of the London Symphony Orchestra.For further information please refer to the website www.lso.co.uk\/bmw-classics.For  press material, please visit www.lso.co.uk\/more\/press.html. For further questions please  contact:Christopher MillardLondon Symphony  OrchestraHead of Press & External RelationsTelephone:  +44 20 7545 502226Email: chris.millard@lso.co.ukDoris FleischerBMW Group Corporate and Governmental  AffairsCultural EngagementTelephone: +49 89 382    27806Email: Doris.Fleischer@bmw.dewww.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.de\n"}

Donington Park (GBR) is the next stop for BMW Motorrad    Motorsport in the FIM Superbike World Championship. The fourth round    of the 2021 WorldSBK season will take place this coming weekend (2nd    to 4th July) at the historic circuit in the heart of England. The    BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team will once again be competing with riders    Michael van der Mark (NED) and Tom Sykes (GBR), as well as Eugene    Laverty (IRL) and Jonas Folger (GER) for the BMW satellite teams RC    Squadra Corse and Bonovo MGM Racing.  After the third round at Misano (ITA), WorldSBK took a short break  with no races taking place over two weekends. BMW Motorrad Motorsport  used that time for two days of testing at Navarra (ESP). The Spanish  circuit has been added to the calendar this year and will host the  seventh race event of the season from 20th to 22nd August. The tests  provided an opportunity to continue development of the new BMW M 1000  RR, while simultaneously becoming familiar with the characteristics of  the circuit. The focus now switches to the upcoming weekend at Donington Park. The  very first WorldSBK race took place on this track in April 1988.  Donington has been a fixture on the calendar since then, even though  the event had to be cancelled last year due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Quotes ahead of the Donington round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “The  first three events of the season showed us what areas we need to work  on with our new BMW M 1000 RR, and we did that during testing at  Navarra, among other things. We tried out and evaluated a few new  parts in the chassis area, for example. Now we are looking forward to  the race weekend at Donington Park. That is a traditional, old-school  circuit and the layout has a really challenging mix of everything.  There are fast, fluid sections as well as hairpin bends, climbs and  slopes. We will see how well our M RR copes with this track. We are  excited to see what the weather will be like at the weekend, as that  can always be an unpredictable factor at Donington.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We’re looking forward to coming to the UK round of the World  Superbike Championship. The Navarra test was quite conclusive for us.  We have a better direction with the chassis after the chassis work  both Tom and Michael have done. Hopefully we can transfer some of that  into the Donington event. The forecast for the Donington event is  quite changeable. Friday is fair weather but Saturday and Sunday it  looks like we have some wet weather appearing just right during the  mid-days. So we could be racing in changeable conditions with  potential pit stops so we need to be ready for that eventuality.  Overall as a team, we are in a good position, disappointed from Misano  for sure, but we need to put things right for Donington and hopefully  we can do just this.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  was good to have a test at Navarra, not only as we race there later  this year, but also as we had faced some problems at Misano and BMW  responded very quick so we had some new parts to Navarra test. I was  happy with the test; it was a step in the right direction but of  course you have to see if it also works on a different track but  luckily we have Donington this weekend. Donington is fantastic; I  really love these old-school circuits. I had some good results there  in the past and I love the circuit and the history and after missing  it last year, it is good to go back there now. Regarding the  characteristics, for me the first part is the best; it is fast and  flowing and a really exciting section of the track. The last part does  not really fit to that but there you have some really good overtaking  opportunities so the circuit is exciting in two very different ways.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “For me, the  Navarra test was good for a number of reasons. First and foremost it  was to continue the development of the new BMW M 1000 RR. We had some  items that we needed to confirm there and we were able to do that.  Then it was great to learn the circuit and get some data there for  when we go back in August for the races. Now I am obviously looking  forward to my home race at Donington. I’ve had a lot of success there  in the past and I really hope that we can find the set-up to enable me  to be more consistent and stronger over the race weekend. We need to  work on finding those last little items now to put us in that  position. The new M RR has had a big step in terms of engine and  braking performance and quite a number of other things so we just need  to find the last part of the jigsaw so we can use all of this. I am  looking forward to going there and fingers crossed we can have some  good British weather. But we take what we get and try to get a strong result.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “The three-week  break has given me a chance to recover fully from my Misano crash. I  feel fit and ready to get back in the mix. The majority of the  Donington circuit has a flowing nature and that suits the BMW M 1000  RR well. That said, we will continue to work on our weak area of  braking because that’s where the races are often decided at Donington  Park. Three hard braking areas finish the lap and that will be the  main focus of our work during Friday practice in order to be ready for  the races.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I am already  looking forward to Donington, even though it has been a while since I  was there last – 13 years. As far as I can remember, it is a cool  track. Donington is a real classic on the racing calendar. I hope that  we can take another step forward after testing at Navarra and that we  can improve.”  Track Facts Donington Park.Circuit        length4.023          km – clockwiseCorners12 – 7 right-handers, 5 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight550          metres (start-finish straight)Grip levelMediumTrack        layoutFluid, fast turns; hard braking zones; climbs          and descentsStrain on        brakesMediumAmount at full        throttle38 %Top speed \/ lowest        speed277          km\/h \/ 45 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityT1, T9, T11Key        factorsHigh          speeds through the turns, stability and feel on brakes when          leaning, courage \n"}

An international jury selected him unanimously from a shortlist  of three artists represented by galleries who were originally selected  for this year’s Art Basel in Hong Kong. Julien Creuzet is represented  by the gallery High Art, Paris. The BMW Art Journey is part of BMW  Group’s global cultural engagement celebrating its 50th  anniversary this year. Committed in the fields of modern and  contemporary art, classical music, jazz and sound as well as  architecture and design, the BMW Group has been an integral part of  culture on a global scale.For Julien Creuzet, a member of the Caribbean diaspora in Paris, the  BMW Art Journey – the tenth in the series – will mark a return to his  ancestral home, a place he calls “the heart of my imagination.” In a  poetic journey that intertwines personal discovery with profound  environmental concern and a generous spirit of sharing, he will center  his travels around a geographically and culturally distinct region. In  Martinique, he will work closely with a community of  art students from Fort-de-France, as well as musicians and filmmakers.  His plans include creating hybrid sculptures of Antillean fauna as  well as plastic and industrial objects, in a gesture of circularity.  In Guadeloupe, he will film underwater scenes as well  as obtain aerial visuals with drones. Often neglected in the  metropolitan imagination, the Antilles are not just homeland for  Creuzet but a site inviting consideration of the legacies of  colonialism, conflict, and marginalization. During his journey,  Creuzet will meet with cultural actors and collect visual materials  and music for a “Caribbean road movie” that merges fiction and  documentary, augmented by poetry and 3-D art.“I am really excited to be the winner of the BMW Art Journey:  It is  a great chance to reconnect with the heart of my imagination and my  Native land. This journey will allow me to collaborate with local  artists, writers, poets, musicians, students and then setting up a  real environment in Martinique,” says Julien Creuzet.Members of the international expert jury are Claire  Hsu, Director, Asia Art  Archive, Hong Kong; Matthias Mühling, Director,    Städtische Galerie im    Lenbachhaus und Kunstbau, Munich; Patrizia Sandretto Re  Rebaudengo, President, Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo,  Turin; Philip Tinari, Director, UCCA Center for Contemporary  Art, Beijing; and Samson Young, artist and winner of the  first BMW Art Journey. “Julien Creuzet’s journey is not a trip to a distant and unknown  destination, but rather a return to a familiar place – a place of  family, youth, and education,” the jury noted, reaching its unanimous  decision. “The project rethinks mobility, the climate crisis, and  societal shifts in the wake of Covid-19. Focusing on a single  location, Creuzet underscores the importance of the local and of  reconnecting with one’s roots. His journey combines histories with  fantasies, and ancestral connections with cosmopolitanism. We were  impressed by the generosity of his project, how it makes space for  other artists – a gesture of care and humility that’s in keeping with  our healing moment.”In addition to Julien Creuzet, the shortlisted artists for the BMW  Art Journey 2021 were: Kelvin Kyun Kun Park  (represented by Vanguard Gallery, Shanghai) and Alice  Wang (represented by Capsule Shanghai).Launched in 2015, the BMW Art Journey is a  collaboration between Art Basel and BMW, created to recognize and  support emerging artists worldwide. Since 2020, the circle of eligible  artists has broadened and includes not only emerging and mid-career  artists from the Discoveries sector, but also artists represented by  galleries founded no more than ten years ago at Art Basel’s show in  Hong Kong. In recognition of the ongoing exceptional circumstances  caused by the pandemic, the international expert jury conducted its  selection process online. The selected artists were then invited to  submit proposals for a journey aimed to further develop their artistic  work. Based on these proposals the winner was selected. Julien Creuzet  plans to start his BMW Art Journey in summer 2021.Past winners of the BMW Art Journey include sound and performance  artist Samson Young (presented by a.m. Space, Hong  Kong at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2015); video artists    Henning Fehr and Philipp Rühr (presented by Galerie  Max Mayer, Dusseldorf at Art Basel's Miami Beach show in 2015);    Abigail Reynolds (presented by Rokeby, London at  Art Basel's show in Hong Kong in 2016) as well as Max Hooper  Schneider (presented by High Art, Paris at Art Basel's Miami  Beach show in 2016), Astha Butail (represented by  GALLERYSKE, New Dehli, Bangalore at Art Basel´s Hong Kong show in  2017), Jamal Cyrus (represented by Inman Gallery,  Houston at Art Basel’s Miami Beach show in 2017), Zac  Langdon-Pole (represented by Michael Lett, Auckland at Art  Basel’s Hong Kong show in 2018), Lu Yang (represented  by the gallery Société, Berlin at Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2019)  and Leelee Chan (represented by Capsule Shanghai at  Art Basel's Hong Kong show in 2021).BMW has supported Art Basel’s shows in Basel, Miami Beach and Hong  Kong for many years.For further information about the artists and their projects, please  visit: www.bmw-art-journey.com For further questions please contact:Prof. Dr  Thomas Girst BMW Group Corporate and Governmental Affairs  Head of Cultural Engagement Telephone: +49 89 382    24753Email: Thomas.Girst@bmwgroup.comwww.press.bmwgroup.comEmail:    presse@bmw.deSarah DegenArt BaselSenior Media Relations  ManagerTelephone: +41 58 206 2706Email: press@artbasel.com\n"}

Auberlen set about extending his lead, which he  defended comfortably through to the finish. The win sees Auberlen and  Foley maintain their overall lead in the GTD class of the IMSA series. Reactions to the race at Watkins Glen: John Edwards (#24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    2nd place GTLM class): “That was really close in  the end. I gave it everything and managed to overtake one Corvette. I  was also able to put pressure on the other, but it managed to find a  bit more speed when I was right behind it. So second place it is. The  battle was fun, but the result is a little bittersweet. However, to be  honest, at the halfway point of the race I did not think we had any  chance at all against the Corvettes.” Jesse Krohn (#24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    2nd place GTLM class): “A flawless race from the  entire team was rewarded with two podiums. Unfortunately, it was not  quite enough for the win. The Corvette had a little more speed than we  did, so we made the most of what was possible for us. An awesome job  from the team.” Augusto Farfus (#24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    2nd place GTLM class): “We have every reason to  celebrate. Our two podiums and the class win for Turner Motorsport are  fantastic results for BMW M Motorsport. BMW Team RLL did a perfect  job. We leave Watkins Glen with a smile on our face.” Connor De Phillippi (#25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    3rd place GTLM class): “Third place for us and  two cars on the podium – that is a good result for BMW M Motorsport,  even if I would obviously have preferred to win. Unfortunately, our  opponents were very quick, but we got the most out of our strategy. I  fought hard for the podium at the end, and basically passed the #4  Corvette on the last lap. These are important points for us in the  overall standings.” Bruno Spengler (#25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    3rd place GTLM class): “I am pleased that the  team was rewarded for its fantastic performance with two podium  finishes. We obviously wanted to win, but we were just lacking a  little pace. We were able to compensate for this disadvantage in the  traffic. In the end, however, I think second and third place were the  best we could have hoped for.” Philipp Eng (#25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE, BMW Team RLL,    3rd place GTLM class): “The race was hectic but  a lot of fun. It was fantastic to drive alongside Connor and Bruno for  BMW Team RLL and to celebrate two podiums. I can hardly wait to return  for ‘Petit Le Mans’.” Bill Auberlen (#96 BMW M6 GT3, Turner Motorsport,    1st place GTD class):“Today was simply our day. We were actually no longer in our planned  fuelling rhythm after a problem during refuelling. However, the yellow  phase began exactly at the moment in which we had come in for our  final stop. We came out, and all the GTD cars in front of us still had  to come into the pits. That put me in front and I just had to keep it  clean through to the finish. It worked out superbly.”\n"}

Viktor Hovland carded rounds of 68, 67, 64 and 70    (269) to win the 2021 BMW International Open with a final score of    -19. This was the Norwegian’s maiden victory on the European Tour at    the 17th attempt and sees him climb to 13th    place in the world rankings. 2008 winner Martin Kaymer (271 shots,    -17), who remains the only German champion and youngest winner in    the history of the tournament, had to settle for second place, just    two shots back. Amateur Matthias Schmid (277, -11) impressed with an    excellent 14th place.“Congratulations to Viktor Hovland on an impressive and deserved  victory at the 32nd BMW International Open, which sees him  make history as the first European Tour winner from Norway,” said Ilka  Horstmeier, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Human  Resources, Labour Relations Director. “This tournament has been a  feast of top-class golf, but there was one thing missing. We missed  the many fans lining the fairways and greens, whose enthusiasm usually  creates such a fantastic flair and atmosphere. We are very much  looking forward to experiencing that together with all the visitors  again next year.”After three rounds, in which Hovland produced a display of excellent  golf, as well as an impressive composure and calm, the young  Norwegian’s three-shot lead looked set to make Sunday a formality.  However, he struggled with a cold putter on his final round, despite  continuing to take a very aggressive approach. On several occasions,  Hovland found himself in a tie for the lead. However, strong nerves at  the end of a round that included four birdies and two bogeys helped  him to a historic victory.“I am very happy to be sat here with the trophy. When you lead after  three rounds, you can’t help thinking about what might be. That was  not a good round today, but in the end I decided to play simple golf  and stay true to myself,” said Hovland. “I really enjoyed being back  in Europe. I keep hearing from colleagues what a fantastic tournament  BMW puts on here. That was one of the reasons for coming to Munich. It  was great to experience that for myself. I will definitely be back  next year.”Despite trailing Hovland by eight shots after three rounds, Kaymer  came very close to claiming a second victory at the BMW International  Open on Sunday. An outstanding performance – the two-time major winner  carded ten birdies and just two bogeys – twice brought him into a  share of the lead. In the end, a very satisfied Kaymer had to settle  for second place: “I took a lot from today, particularly the birdie  putt on the 18th. Whether or not it is ultimately enough for the win  does not really matter. I gave myself chances. That is important. It  was a wonderful tournament, and I feel sorry for the whole BMW team,  which has invested a lot of work, that we were not allowed to have  more spectators. I would have liked that.”Schmid was presented with the trophy for the best amateur. Although  the 22-year-old German was the only non-professional in the field, he  more than deserved the recognition following four under-par rounds  that saw him finish tied in 14th place. “It was very tidy  from tee to green, but my short game and putting were nothing special.  I only made a few birdies from promising positions,” he said after his  final round. On the whole, however, he was happy. “It has been a  fantastic week for me against a home backdrop!”23-year-old Norrman made history in the third round, when he hit an  extremely rare hole-in-one on a par 4 hole. Using a 3-wood, he drove  his tee shot straight into the hole on the 247-metre 16th. This was  only the third albatross in the 32-year history of the tournament –  following in the footsteps of José Maria Olazábal (ESP, 2001, hole 11,  par 5) and Rafa Echenique (ARG, 2009, hole 18, par 5) – and the first  on a par 4.Unfortunately, nobody was able to produce the perfect shot on the  17th to win this week’s BMW Hole-in-One Award. Neither the  pros nor amateur Paul Neumann, whose trick shot won the “Steal the  Car” competition on the BMW Golfsport social media channels. Neumann  was rewarded on Tuesday with 50 attempts to hit a hole-in-one that  would have won him the BMW iX, the BMW Group’s new fully-electric flagship.\n"}

The 23-year-old holds a  healthy three-shot lead over the man in second place, Jorge Campillo  (-14). The rest of the chasing pack are led by Darren Fichardt (RSA,  -13, 3), and Bernd Wiesberger (AUT) and Niall Kearney (IRL, both -11, T4).“I just try to stay within myself. Obviously, I look at leaderboards  to see where I’m at, but instead of trying to force things, I just  tell myself at the start of the day just to take control of my own  game,” said Hovland, describing the secret to his success. “If I don’t  waste shots here and there, just play smart, trust that I’m doing the  right things, I think I should have a really good shot tomorrow.”Meanwhile, 23-year-old Norrman made tournament history when he hit an  extremely rare hole-in-one on a par 4. Using a 3 wood, he drove his  ball 270 yards into the hole. This was only the third albatross in the  history of the tournament, following in the footsteps of José Maria  Olazábal (ESP, 2001, hole 11, par 5) and Rafa Echenique (ARG, 2009,  hole 18, par 5). “It is incredible. Unfortunately, that shot came one  hole too early,” said the Swede, referring to the BMW iX on offer for  an ace on the 17th hole. “I think BMW should put the  Hole-in-One Award on the 16th hole in the future. The hole  is harder to hit – you deserve a BMW for that.”Kaymer was in touch with the leaders at the start of his round, but a  double-bogey on the 16th, after a poor third shot landed in  the water, cost him a better position. Despite this, the two-time  major winner was still satisfied and said: “It was very solid for 17  holes. I just dropped two or three shots on the rest of the field on  one hole. With a par, I would have been right in the tournament.  However, I am focussing on the big picture. I have played three solid  rounds and given myself a lot of chances. I will need a 7 or 8 under  to be up there challenging tomorrow. That is possible, but you have to  avoid making those odd errors here and there.”The positive surprise of the tournament remains the only amateur in  the field. Matthias Schmid hit another impressive round of 69. The  22-year-old is at one with himself and has a healthy self-confidence.  “I am playing the same game as everyone else, so I believe I can  achieve something tomorrow. I will try to play a good round, then  we’ll see what happens,” said Schmid.\n"}

A brilliant performance saw them prevail against stiff opposition, making them the youngest team in the history of endurances races to win at the Nürburgring (GER). ->","completion":" Nürburg. After four extremely exciting hours of racing, a    dream came true for the BMW Junior Team, its first overall victory    on the Nordschleife with the BMW M6 GT3. Neil Verhagen (USA), Max    Hesse (GER) and Dan Harper (GBR) won race four of the 2021    Nürburgring Endurance Series. A brilliant performance saw them    prevail against stiff opposition, making them the youngest team in    the history of endurances races to win at the Nürburgring (GER). Harper laid the foundation for this success in morning qualifying  when he secured second place on the grid for the #44 BMW M6 GT3.  Verhagen was first behind the wheel in the race, and kept the trio on  course for a podium finish from the opening lap. During Hesse’s stint,  some of the lap times he set were five seconds quicker than his  closest rivals. A drive-through penalty, which the team received two  hours into the race following a collision at the start, initially saw  the team drop back through the field. However, this was to be just a  brief setback. With a good one and a half hours remaining, Harper moved to the head  of the field in the #44 BMW M6 GT3. He then defended his lead superbly  in a thrilling duel with the second-placed Audi. When both cars came  in for their final pit stop at the same time, roughly 40 minutes from  the end of the race, the Audi briefly took the lead. However, it only  took Harper a few corners to retake the lead, as the team cheered on.  After four hours of racing, the #44 BMW M6 GT3 crossed the finish line  in first place. The car was run by BMW Team RMG. “That was a fantastic race,” said mentor Jochen Neerpasch, who was  spellbound as he followed the action in the garage. “In the 24-hour  race the boys showed that they belong in the top class. However, they  graduated in style here today. It was an outstanding performance. It  was not gifted to them, but was a very tough race. The way they  withstood the pressure was impressive. That is by no means a matter of  course at this young age. The BMW Juniors have shown once again how  well they work together as a team.” “I am just super, super happy. This is a dream come true for us all,”  said Hesse. “We worked hard all year and, unfortunately, were not  rewarded with the result our effort deserved. I believe we have now  paid the team back a little. The guys really put their foot down. A  big thank you also goes to Augusto Farfus, without whom we certainly  would not be here now. We are just happy and want to continue this way.” “Max and Dan did an amazing job; BMW Team RMG and BMW M Motorsport  did an amazing job as well for the great car we had,” added Verhagen.  “We just got our heads down, we got into it, we also were able to get  through the drive-through penalty and bring it back into the lead  again. It was very impressive. Being the youngest overall winners on  the Nordschleife is something super special. It has been amazing.” Harper said of his final one-and-a-half-hour stint, which developed  into a thrilling sprint to the finish: “There was just full push from  the very beginning as soon as I got into the car. I had the Audi right  behind me. The whole way through, those one and a half hours, it was  very intense. There was a couple of wild moments on the grass but I am  just so proud of the whole team, BMW Team RMG, BMW M Motorsport and of  course my team-mates Max and Neil. From last year, when the programme  started to now we have come so far together and I think this is a bit  of a fairy tale. I just hope that we can step onto the top step of the  podium many more times together.” The Nordschleife season continues for Harper, Hesse and Verhagen on  10th and 11th July, with races five and six of this season’s  Nürburgring Endurance Series. \n"}

The race debut of the BMW M4 GT3 has had to be    postponed. The plan was for the new race car to take part in round    four of the 2021 Nürburgring Endurance Series, on Saturday on the    Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER), but this has had to be cancelled at    short notice. The car suffered damage in a crash during the closing    stages of the test and set-up session on Friday evening and could    not be repaired overnight. BMW M Motorsport is currently analysing    the cause of the crash in detail. Up to this point, the intense week of testing with the BMW M4 GT3 had  run smoothly. On Monday and Tuesday, BMW M Motorsport had the  opportunity to take part in the official SRO tests ahead of the  24-hour race at Spa-Francorchamps (BEL). After the new car’s first  outing at the Belgian circuit, BMW M Motorsport drew an extremely  positive conclusion in all areas. Augusto Farfus (BRA), Marco Wittmann  (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR) alternated behind the wheel at Spa-Francorchamps. From the Ardennes, the BMW M4 GT3 headed straight to the Eifel region  of Germany, where Jens Klingmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)  took over in the cockpit. Friday’s test and set-up drives on the Grand  Prix Circuit and Nürburgring-Nordschleife were also going very well  until the crash, which occurred shortly before the end of the session.  A technical issue resulted in Van der Linde losing control of the car  and crashing into the barriers. “It is a great shame that our test week with the BMW M4 GT3, which  had been very successful up until that point, ended prematurely – and  that we have had to postpone the car’s race debut, to which we were  all very much looking forward,” said Mike Krack, Head of BMW M  Motorsport. “The impact caused damage to the car and so we decided to  withdraw from the NLS race on Saturday. We did not take this decision  lightly. However, our priority now is to find out exactly what caused  the crash. It is not uncommon to have a technical issue in the  development phase of a new car. That is precisely what these intensive  tests are for: to identify potential weaknesses during the development  phase, and to eliminate these for the future. That is what we will do now.” Generally speaking, the BMW M4 GT3, the new flagship in the BMW M  Motorsport range, once again impressed in terms of driveability and  handling at Spa-Francorchamps and on the Nordschleife. “Friday was our  second outing with the BMW M4 GT3 on the Nordschleife, and I felt very  comfortable in the car from the first lap,” said Klingmann. “It  definitely confirmed the positive impression I got last time, and the  further development since then has certainly made the car even better.  Clear progress has been made with the BMW M4 GT3 in the sections, in  which the BMW M6 GT3 was weaker. At the same time, it has retained the  strengths of the M6. I am feeling very positive: the car feels good  and gives you a lot of confidence from the first lap.” Yelloly, who set the fastest time with the BMW M4 GT3 during the test  at Spa-Francorchamps, agreed: “We did a lot of driving in the rain on  day one, while the second day was dry. That gave us the opportunity to  complete a lot of laps with the BMW M4 GT3 in all conditions. The car  felt fantastic, ran like clockwork, and the balance is outstanding. We  completed a lot of test work in a wide range of areas at  Spa-Francorchamps. The fact that we set the fastest time was obviously  a nice bonus.” \n"}

Two-time major    winner Martin Kaymer also worked his way up the leaderboard and is    still very much in contention to win the most prestigious golf    tournament in Germany for a second time, having previously triumphed    in 2008. Amateur Matthias Schmid made the cut for the first time at    a European Tour event, after which he said confidently: “You play to win”.After rounds of 68 and 67, Hovland is one of the chasing pack just  two shots behind leader Kearney and is visibly enjoying himself at his  first BMW International Open. “It’s still a little wet out there, but  the course is holding up great. Even playing in the afternoon, the  greens are still great. You can make a lot of putts, which I did  today. I just have to continue playing this way at the weekend.”Kaymer made a dream start to his second round and was five under par  for the day after nine holes. He carded three bogeys on the back nine,  but bounced back each time with a birdie on the following hole. The  36-year-old has his trainer Günter Kessler at his side this week, and  said: “My trainer must have earned me four or five shots this week. I  hit a lot of good tee shots, which had been an issue in recent weeks.  We have done a lot of practice on the driving range. That is why I hit  a lot of fairways and reached the green on some par-four holes in one.”Louis Oosthuizen is another top-class player who has moved into a  promising position ahead of the weekend. The South African, who  narrowly missed out on his second major title at the US Open last  Sunday, carded a round of 67 on Friday. Oosthuizen put his change in  fortunes since yesterday (70) down to the fact that he has recovered  from the jet lag he was suffering.Schmid goes into the weekend tied with the two major winners. The man  from Germany made the cut for the first time on the European Tour and  is looking to go on the offensive at the weekend. “I am in a good  position and not far off the lead. I am looking up the leaderboard at  the weekend. I don’t need to defend 20th place, as I won’t  receive the money anyway. You play to win.”The leader at the halfway point is 33-year-old Niall Kearney (-11),  who took 68 shots today after a brilliant opening round of 65 and is  enjoying the week in Eichenried. “The course is fantastic. It suits my  eye – old fashioned avenues, and it’s quite tight off the tee. I’ve  really enjoyed it.”Despite being tied for second place, Wiesberger was not entirely  satisfied: “Today’s score is okay.  Little spells of giving away shots  today at the end and in the middle of the round yesterday, which I  felt was unnecessary. I was kind of in control, but I didn’t feel like  I was firing on all cylinders.”As well as Kaymer and Schmid, fellow Germans Nicolai von  Dellingshausen, Marcel Schneider, Philipp Mejow and Freddy Schott,  (all -2, T57) also made the cut.Defending champion Andrea Pavan (ITA) was disqualified after he  signed for an incorrect scorecard. European Ryder Cup captain Pádraig  Harrington (IRL) will no longer be playing at the weekend. He and  Germans Stephan Jäger, Alex Cejka, Max Kieffer – on his  31st birthday –, Bernd Ritthammer, Benedict Staben, Max  Schmitt and Thomas Rosenmüller all failed to make the cut.

Sim racers have been able to contest races with the    development model of the new BMW M4 GT3 on iRacing since the start    of the year. Now, the simulation platform has released an upgrade of    the car with the latest BMW M Motorsport design. This version of the    BMW M4 GT3 comes very close to the handling of the real car which is    set to make its race debut next Saturday. This is the result of very    close, intensive collaboration between BMW works driver Bruno    Spengler (CAN) and the iRacing developers during the further    development in recent months. About six months after the virtual BMW M4 GT3 made its debut on  iRacing the upgrade of the car is due to be launched. This was worked  on by Spengler in collaboration with Chris Lerch (USA), the head  Vehicle Dynamics Engineer for the simulation platform, and an internal  iRacing test driver. The team focussed primarily on working on the  driving physics, chassis and optimisations in selected aerodynamic  areas. “The aim was to make the handling as similar to that of the  real car as possible,” explained Spengler. The BMW works driver was the perfect point of contact for this as he  has already tested the real-world BMW M4 GT3 himself and is also an  experienced sim racer who has already brought home countless wins and  titles on iRacing. “Bruno’s input was invaluable to this project,“  said Lerch. “His test drives and his feedback advanced the development  from start to finish. We are extremely grateful to him for his input.” The basis for the further development of the virtual BMW M4 GT3 in  recent months was first and foremost Spengler’s subjective driving  experience. The iRacing developers used the comprehensive vehicle data  that they received from BMW M Motorsport last year to convert  Spengler’s very detailed feedback into actual numbers for the upgrade.  That is how the team went from one version of the BMW M4 GT3 to the  next, until it was as realistic as possible from Spengler’s  perspective. The iRacing test driver was tasked with collecting his  impressions, which help classify the car correctly in the balance of  performance that is crucial for GT3 races. And Lerch contributed the  perspective of a hobby sim racer, as the aim is for the BMW M4 GT3 to  be very drivable for that level as well. “It was a cool challenge bringing sim racing and real-world racing  together like this,” summed up Spengler. “The collaboration with  iRacing was fantastic and was a lot of fun. From my perspective, the  virtual BMW M4 GT3 is now very like the real thing. I’m excited to  hear what the sim racers have to say.” The real-world BMW M4 GT3 is set to make its race debut in the new  BMW M Motorsport design next Saturday, in the Nürburgring Endurance  Series. The same design is now available to all sim racers on iRacing.\n"}

The two-time major winner carded a solid  opening round, with four birdies and two bogeys. However, Kaymer feels  there is still room for improvement, particularly on the greens. “I  had a lot of chances today, but struggled to get the ball in the hole.

Unfortunately, I  missed the odd putt here and there. However, I am satisfied. It was a  solid performance.”Hovland returned to the clubhouse with a more colourful scorecard,  which featured an eagle but also two bogeys. “On the whole, it was  good, but a hit a few poor shots – unfortunately, on the par 5 and the  short par 4, where I found the water. There are a lot of birdie  opportunities on this course, but I have to stop hitting it in the water.”Bernd Wiesberger (AUT, -5) ended the round in tenth place, setting  himself up nicely for the next three days.

BMW Team RLL is ready for the third endurance race of the    2021 season, the Six Hours of the Glen at Watkins Glen (USA) this    coming Sunday, 27th June. As they look to defend the 2020 GTLM class    Michelin Endurance Cup title, the team has already scored three    podium results with its MOTUL BMW M8 GTEs in the first two races of    the year. A third-place finish at the Rolex 24 At Daytona (USA) to    start the season was followed by a double-podium (second and third    places) at the 12 Hours of Sebring (USA) in March. BMW Team RLL now    aims to continue this podium streak, in the final season of    competition of the BMW M8 GTE, at Watkins Glen. The #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE will be driven by John Edwards (USA), Jesse  Krohn (FIN) and Augusto Farfus (BRA). Their team-mates Connor De  Phillippi (USA), Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Philipp Eng (AUT) will share  duties in the #25 car. Earlier this month, the team completed two  successful days of testing at Watkins Glen in preparation for the race. In the GTD class, the Turner Motorsport team will enter the #96 BMW  M6 GT3 with Bill Auberlen, Robby Foley (both USA) and Aidan Read (AUS)  at the wheel. The Six Hours of the Glen will take the green flag at  10:40 a.m. local time (16:40 CEST) on Sunday, 27th June. Quotes ahead of the Six Hours of the Glen: Bobby Rahal (Team Principal BMW Team RLL): “Based on  the results of the test at the Glen we can be very encouraged. We have  had some good qualifying results in recent years, but podium finishes  have eluded us. There is nothing easy about Watkins Glen. It demands a  great deal from a driver, but that is what makes it a track that is  always looked forward to.”   John Edwards (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “Watkins Glen is definitely my favorite track in the  U.S. and after we didn’t get to race here last year, I’ve been itching  to get back! The elevation changes and high average speeds have always  made this a special place, but since the track got repaved a few years  ago, it added even more grip to an already fast circuit. After a  couple podiums to start out our season, I would love to get our first  win of 2021 at this awesome track to keep us in the fight in our title  defense of the Michelin Endurance Cup.” Jesse Krohn (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “I  have always enjoyed racing at Watkins Glen. BMW Team RLL has always  proven competitive there and this year we are looking very strong.” Augusto Farfus (BMW Team RLL, #24 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “This will be my first-time racing at Watkins Glen. On  paper and in the simulator it looks challenging and looks to be a  track I will enjoy. We have two podiums from two races so far this  season so let’s keep up the good work.” Bruno Spengler (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE):  “Our test this month was my first time at Watkins Glen, and I  thoroughly enjoyed the track. Last year, the six-hour race was moved  to Michelin Raceway Road Atlanta because of Covid-19 and Connor and I  won that race. It looks to me that traffic management will be one of  the keys to success this weekend.” Connor De Phillippi (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8  GTE): “After two years away from Watkins Glen, it is great to  finally be back to one of my favorite racetracks. The BMW M8 GTE has  always performed very well there, and I’m confident we can give our M8  an excellent final showing at this historic track. The #25 car boys  are ready for a win after being so close in the previous event!” Philipp Eng (BMW Team RLL, #25 MOTUL BMW M8 GTE): “I  am very much looking forward to my first laps around the great circuit  of Watkins Glen. We had a good run in Sebring finishing second. I  really enjoy my racing in IMSA together with BMW Team RLL and I really  hope that we are scoring another strong result at the Glen!” \n"}

{"prompt":"BMW M Motorsport teams are once again in action all over the world in 2021. They are challenging for race wins and titles with the BMW M6 GT3, the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW M2 CS Racing, and other BMW M Motorsport race cars. Our BMW M Motorsport News allows us to give you an overview of the race action in various championships around the world and any success enjoyed by the BMW M Motorsport teams. ->","completion":" DTM: Top-five finishes for the BMW M6 GT3 at Monza season-opener. The Royal Park in Monza (ITA) hosted last weekend’s opening round of  the new GT3 DTM. Among those lining up in the realigned championship  were the Walkenhorst Motorsport and ROWE Racing teams with their BMW  M6 GT3. Saturday was a tough day, with only Marco Wittmann (GER)  making it into the top ten in ninth place in the #11 Walkenhorst  Motorsport car. Sheldon van der Linde (RSA) and Timo Glock (GER), both  driving for ROWE Racing, finished 12th and 17th. The tide turned for the BMW teams on Sunday, as the BMW M6 GT3 picked  up two top-five finishes. Van der Linde had impressed in the #31 car  in qualifying, securing third place on the grid. In the race itself,  the South African made a spectacular overtaking manoeuvre to pass both  Nico Müller (SUI \/ Audi) and Liam Lawson (NZL \/ Ferrari) in one go.  After the round of pit stops, van der Linde found himself in fourth  place, a position he maintained through to the finish. Wittmann made  an impressive comeback from eleventh place on the grid and crossed the  finish line just behind van der Linde in fifth place. Glock was forced  to retire as a consequence of a collision in the jostling for position  on lap one. Round two of the 2021 DTM season takes place from 23rd to  25th July at the Lausitzring (GER). --DTM Trophy: Magnificent season-opener for the BMW M4 GT4 at Monza. The DTM Trophy also kicked off the 2021 season at Monza (ITA) at the  weekend – and victory in the first two races of the year went to BMW M  Motorsport teams and the BMW M4 GT4. The season started with a bang in  race one on Saturday, with eight BMW M4 GT4s in the first nine places.  It was Ben Green (GBR) from the FK Performance Motorsport team who led  from start to finish to convert pole position into victory. He was  joined on the podium by his team-mate Moritz Löhner (GER) who comes  from an Esports background and finished third in his first ever car  race. Positions four to nine also went to BMW M Motorsport teams. In race two on Sunday, Michael Schrey (GER) from the Hofor Racing by  Bonk Motorsport team claimed his maiden victory in the DTM Trophy. He  led the race in his BMW M4 GT4 for a long time, before eventually  crossing the finish line in second place. However, the driver ahead of  him was subsequently handed a time penalty for gaining an advantage by  leaving the track in a chicane. That saw Schrey promoted to first  place. Victory on Sunday and fourth place on Saturday put Schrey  second in the championship at the end of the opening weekend, followed  by Green and Löhner in third and fourth. --ADAC GT Masters: Podium for Schubert Motorsport at the Red    Bull Ring. The ADAC GT Masters held its second event of the season at the Red  Bull Ring in Spielberg (AUT) from 11th to 13th  June. As at the opening round at Oschersleben (GER) in May, Schubert  Motorsport featured on the podium. Nick Yelloly (GBR) and Jesse Krohn  (FIN) were third in the #10 BMW M6 GT3 in Sunday’s race. The duo  failed to finish race one on the Saturday. --ADAC GT4 Germany: Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport dominates in Spielberg. One week before his maiden DTM Trophy win, Michael Schrey (GER) and  the Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport team dominated proceedings in ADAC  GT4 Germany. Schrey and team-mate Gabriele Piana (ITA) were unbeatable  again in the #2 BMW M4 GT4 at round two of the season, which took  place from 11th to 13th June at the Red Bull  Ring in Spielberg (AUT). They had previously won both races at the  season-opener in May at Oschersleben (GER) – and they repeated that  double success in Austria. With four wins from four races,  Schrey\/Piana and Hofor Racing by Bonk Motorsport hold big leads in  both the Driver and Team competitions after two events. The Schubert Motorsport team finished in the top eight in both races  at the Red Bull Ring. Michael von Zabiensky and Marcel Lenerz (both  GER) were fifth and eighth in the #10 BMW M4 GT4. --GT4 European Series: Round three of the season at Zandvoort. The GT4 European Series was in the dunes of Zandvoort (NED) last  weekend for its third event of the season. Cem Bölükbasi and Berkay  Besler (both TUR) finished fifth and sixth in the Pro-Am class in the  #12 BMW M4 GT4 of Borusan Otomotiv Motorsport. --GT4 Scandinavia: Lestrup Racing wins with the BMW M4 GT4 at    the season-opener. GT4 Scandinavia kicked off the 2021 season at Fällfors, Sweden, last  weekend. Victory in the first race of the year went to the BMW M4 GT4.  Joakim Walde and Victor Bouveng (both SWE) won the Pro-Am class in the  #98 Lestrup Racing BMW M4 GT4. The duo then finished third in race two. --BTCC: Turkington wins at Snetterton. It was a strong performance from Colin Turkington (GBR) at round two  of the 2021 British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) in Snetterton  (GBR). In the three races on 13th June, he claimed one  victory and a podium in the #2 BMW 330i M Sport. Turkington won race  one and, despite carrying the maximum success weight, finished  runner-up in race two. He then came home third in race three. BMW tops  the Manufacturer standings with 180 points and a lead of ten points  after two rounds. --ESET Cup: Two podiums for the BMW M6 GT3 at Poznan. The Trevor Racing team and the #24 BMW M6 GT3 claimed two podium  finishes in the ESET Cup at Poznan, Poland  (12th\/13th June). Gregor Zsigo (SVK) was third  in the GT race. Together with his team-mate Dennis Waszek (CZE), he  then finished runner-up in the Endurance Race. Trevor Racing was also  successful with the #40 BMW M4 GT4. Ferenc Ficza (HUN) ended the  Endurance Race in fourth place overall to take victory in the D4 GT4 class. \n"}
{"prompt":"BMW i Andretti Motorsport has rounded off the race weekend in Puebla (MEX) by getting both BMW iFE.21s into the points for the first time this season. ->","completion":" Puebla. BMW i Andretti Motorsport has rounded off the race    weekend in Puebla (MEX) by getting both BMW iFE.21s into the points    for the first time this season. Jake Dennis (GBR) finished fifth in    the ninth race of the season in the ABB FIA Formula E World    Championship to repeat his result from the previous day. Maximilian    Günther (GER) finished seventh and also scored important points for    the overall standings. Dennis also chalked up another point for    being the fastest driver in qualifying. Dennis dominated qualifying, recording the best time by some margin,  but then had problems with tyre grip in Super Pole and began the race  from fifth on the grid. This time, Günther could not find the ideal  lap and finished eleventh, missing out on the Super Pole that he had  already reached five times this season. Both drivers improved swiftly during the race, however, consolidating  their positions in the top ten with some consistent lap times. In the  end, Dennis received 11 points for finishing fifth and recording the  best time in qualifying, while Günther scored six points in seventh  place. The two drivers are now in eighth and 18th positions in the  drivers’ standings. In the team championship, BMW i Andretti  Motorsport is now in sixth place with 82 points. Reactions to Race 9 in Puebla. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 7th place):“I think this was a really strong finish to our weekend here in  Mexico. We had again Jake Dennis in Super Pole with fastest overall in  the groups’ qualifying and I think we were all a bit disappointed with  fifth on the grid but if you make it to Super Pole it’s much easier to  race from there. Then in the race, after the initial melee at the  start sort of settled down it was a smart race from Jake. Behind him,  Maximilian Günther starting back in eleventh, worked his way forward.  It was really good aggressive driving from Maximilian but he kept his  energy consumption under control, a good improvement from yesterday.  He was just the wingman to Jake today and when it was necessary he put  Lynn under pressure right at the end and really made him look in his  mirrors rather than trying to attack Jake too hard. First double  points finish for the team of the season, we are super pleased. That  is very valuable for the championship.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 5th    place, race result: 5th place, points: 54, driver    standings: 8th place):“Mexico race two done – I should be pretty happy. It was quite a  technical race with the energy but I think we did the best job  possible. We got a bit unlucky when Edoardo Mortara got to attack mode  and then he ended up catching me at the wrong point so we dropped back  down to fifth. But overall had a quite a clean race and I think we did  the optimum. So I am happy. The team has done a great job all weekend  and we had two guys scoring points today which is super important for  the championship.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    11th place, race result: 7th place, points:    28, driver standings: 18th place):“A great result for the team. We can be really pleased with fifth and  seventh positions. Starting from eleventh on the grid made my race  anything but easy with all the hustle and bustle. I moved up a few  places at the start. We then managed the race intelligently and did  not lose our cool when we dropped back a place or two. We were then  able to make good use of Attack Mode and had the pace required.  Compared to yesterday, we made really good progress today.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

BMW i Andretti Motorsport produced good pace to start    the second half of the season in the eighth race of the ABB FIA    Formula E Championship, but was not rewarded with a podium finish.    Jake Dennis (GBR) finished fifth in the #27 BMW iFE.21 to score ten    points in the overall standings. Like Dennis, Maximilian Günther    (GER) was in the top three for some time, even leading the race for    a while. However, he struggled with energy problems in the final    laps and crossed the finish line in twelfth position. For the first time this season, both BMW i Andretti Motorsport  drivers made it to Super Pole in qualifying. Dennis and Günther  secured third and fifth places on the grid. After a great start,  Günther moved into second position right ahead of Dennis and when  leading driver Pascal Wehrlein (GER, Porsche) pulled into the Attack  Zone, the two BMW iFE.21s were at the head of the field for a short time. Both drivers remained in with a good chance of a podium until a few  laps before the end, only to lose ground. Dennis struggled after the  field moved closer together during the second safety car period and  had to activate Attack Mode one more time which cost him a few places.  After 28 laps, he crossed the line in fifth position, while Günther  struggled with energy problems and finished in twelfth place after  outbraking himself on the final lap. Dennis and Günther are tenth and  17th in the drivers’ standings, and BMW i Andretti Motorsport is in  sixth place in the team championship, with 65 points. Race nine of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E World Championship takes  place on Sunday in Puebla. Reactions to Race 8 in Puebla. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 6th place):“The day started off pretty well. Out of the box I think both cars,  in particular Jake, were very competitive. We had a really good result  in qualifying having both BMW cars in Super Pole for the first time  since Sanya in Season 5. When the lights went green an excellent start  from Maximilian saw him in second place after turn one. Things were  looking very promising. There were a couple of safety car incidents,  one of which worked well for us and the second one unfortunately came  at the wrong time for Jake and really compromised his second Attack  Mode use. The field was packed up at that point and when he rejoined  after taking the attack loop he sort of shuffled in the lower half of  the top-ten. He was able to pick up a couple of spots and was able to  finish in fifth place. We were looking like we are going to get our  first double points score this season right up until the last lap but  Maximilian at the time was somehow compromised with energy and he  tried to defend. He locked up his front tyres and went straight on at  a corner and then unfortunately when he came back onto the race track,  it shuffled him back down into twelfth spot. There’s a lot of data to  review overnight and we’ve got some ideas already on what we can do  differently for tomorrow to hopefully see a stronger finish from both  drivers in the second race here in Mexico.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position: 3rd    place, race result: 5th place, points: 43, driver    standings: 10th place):“We just got unfortunate with the safety car. We were one of only  cars that hadn’t taken Attack Mode. Attack Mode here is so  unforgiving; you lose three seconds, so we went from second to ninth.  There were just a few things that went against us during the whole  race but we brought it back in fifth. At one point I didn’t think we  would even get points so I think as a team we can do better but as a  team we did a mega job to bring this car back in the points.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    5th place, race result: 12th place, points:    22, driver standings: 17th place):“We struggled a bit in the free practice sessions but found a good  direction for qualifying. I felt much more comfortable in the car. I  had a great start from P5 straight to P2 and was able to manage the  race pretty well. I lacked, however, a bit of pace over the entire  race and as a result we slightly overconsumed energy. That led us into  a difficult situation in the end. Over most of the race we were on  course for the podium, but in the end we literally ran out of power  and in turn 11, I had locking tyres on the inside while fighting for  position. As a result, I unfortunately lost the points result on the  final lap. It is disappointing, for sure, but we have to accept that  and shift our focus to tomorrow.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

The  circuit is known as the ‘Ardennes Rollercoaster’ and is a fast,  flowing track. Sharing the test work in Belgium will be Augusto Farfus  (BRA), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Nick Yelloly (GBR).“It is fantastic to have been given the opportunity to take part in  the tests at Spa-Francorchamps with our new BMW M4 GT3,” said Mike  Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport. “Like the Nordschleife, this circuit  has its own particular features, making it an optimal and very  demanding test facility for us in the final stage of development of  our car. The days at Spa will also be used to prepare for the race  debut of the BMW M4 GT3, which we are all excited about. This test,  under race conditions on the Nordschleife, is the next big step on the  way to our first season in 2022.” The 24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps has an important place in BMW’s  motorsport history. With 24 triumphs to its name, the manufacturer is  the record winner of the Belgian marathon. The BMW M4 GT3 will compete  from 2022 and will be looking to continue this success. However, it  must first watch and see how the BMW M6 GT3 gets on in its farewell  performance at Spa at this year’s edition of the endurance classic,  which takes place on 31st July and 1st August. The BMW M4 GT3 will make its race debut at round four of the  Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS), on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife on  26th June, immediately after the tests in Belgium. At the wheel of the  race car will be Jens Klingmann (GER) and Sheldon van der Linde (RSA).  The BMW M4 GT3 will compete in the prototype class SP-X as the new car  is not homologated yet. As this is a test in race mode, the BMW M4 GT3  will not be classified in the Nordschleife results. The outing will be  used to gain valuable experience under race conditions with the new car.  Note to editors: The BMW M4 GT3 will be displayed in the paddock during the fourth NLS  race. Accredited media representatives are invited to check out the  new race car. If interested, please contact Andrea Schwab on +49 151  601 60988.  \n"}
{"prompt":"MINI and Designworks: architects of change. ->","completion":" Munich. On 16 – 18 June 2021, the renowned Greentech  Festival in Berlin will bring together companies and organisations who  put a sustainable future at the heart of what they do. The BMW Group  is a cooperation partner of the festival and will also be present at  the Exhibition and contribute to the Conference. Bernd Körber, Head of  MINI, and Holger Hampf, President of Designworks, will be sparking  ideas as keynote speakers and exploring how they see their roles in  shaping a better future. Sustainability is a guiding principle at the BMW Group.“The visionary, sustainable and future-focused platform provided by  Greentech fits perfectly with the BMW Group’s mission to be a constant  driver of change,” explains Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand  Experience. “We are keen to use our involvement at this year’s  Greentech Festival to highlight the BMW Group’s ability to innovate  and showcase its performance potential beyond the classical automotive  themes. Sustainability and the potential of the circular economy for  the environment and climate protection play a very important role in  the activation of our platforms. As part of its “RE:THINK, RE:DUCE,  RE:USE, RE:CYCLE” approach, the BMW Group will use the IAA MOBILITY  2021 show in September to provide an all-encompassing outlook of how  the use of primary raw materials for the car of the future can be  drastically reduced,” adds Ponikva.The position of the BMW Group is clear: the principle of  sustainability is firmly established across every aspect of the  company. Environmental and societal sustainability, responsibility for  its products and a clear commitment to conserving resources stand at  the core of our company strategy. This not only looks at the emissions  generated by its vehicles, for example, it covers the entire value  chain – the full supply chain, production processes, use phase and recycling. MINI leads the way on sustainable, individual mobility in    urban areas.MINI has always been a creative brand focused on urban mobility. At  MINI, global challenges such as climate change and urbanisation are  viewed as opportunities in which to drive forward innovations which  not only improve the customer experience but also have a positive  societal and environmental impact. For this reason, MINI makes  sustainability an unwavering, integral part of its business model. A  prime example of how this could shape the urban mobility of tomorrow  is the MINI Vision Urbanaut, which brings tangible form to the future  vision of the MINI brand and of sustainable mobility. “The character  of the MINI Vision Urbanaut is shaped by a new awareness of  sustainability. The interior uses natural and recycled materials,  which create a very agreeable feeling of space. And that’s important,  as ultimately the MINI Vision Urbanaut is not just a vehicle, but also  a living space,” explains Bernd Körber. Designworks points the way to the future. Using design to meet the challenges of the future is what  Designworks, the BMW Group’s creative consultancy, is all about. As  “architects of the future”, Designworks develops future-focused  concepts for a wide range of sectors and customers around the world  from its three locations in California, Shanghai and Munich. Holger  Hampf, President of Designworks, explains the underlying necessities:  “We are at a turning point on the path to collective well-being. No  individual, company and or government can tackle global challenges  such as climate change, health or conservation of resources on their  own. We have to do it together – and that requires strong  partnerships. Design plays a significant role here, because it can  develop visions and use visualisations to bring tangible form to the  resulting potential. In times of change, in particular, the positive  energy and consultancy expertise of design companies can help to turn  uncertainty into excitement, point the way ahead, set out strategic  approaches and initiate changes in societal behaviour.” BMW Group at the Exhibition.One example of the innovative power of design can be found in the  electrified wingsuit created by BMW i and Designworks in collaboration  with base jumper and extreme sportsman Peter Salzmann. At the  Greentech Festival, the BMW Group will be presenting the first  electric drive system for a wingsuit which can transport the age-old  dream of flying into reality in a totally new way. An interactive  virtual-reality experience allows visitors to the Greentech Festival  to (almost) fly like Peter Salzmann with the electrified wingsuit.Another highlight at the BMW exhibition area is the latest BMW model  from its electric product range: the BMW i4 eDrive40 Gran Coupé – the  first purely electrically powered BMW coupé. Added to which, the BMW  Group is presenting the BMW i3 Urban Suite, a mobility experience  tailored entirely to the passenger’s individual requirements. Here, a  standard BMW i3 was nearly completely redesigned (only the driver’s  seat and dashboard were retained) to create an interior that brings to  mind the relaxed ambience of a boutique hotel. Several of these  vehicles will be in active service as VIP shuttles at the Greentech Festival.\n"}
{"prompt":"The two new BMW M4 Competition models being driven by the brothers Elias and Johannes Hountondji are now ready for the start of the Drift Masters European Championship. ->","completion":" Munich. Let’s drift! The two new BMW M4 Competition  models (combined fuel consumption: 10.2 – 9.9 l\/100 km according to  WLTP; combined CO2 emissions: 233 – 227 g\/km according to WLTP) being  driven by the Red Bull Driftbrothers are now ready for the racetrack.  Backed by the BMW M GmbH, the brothers Elias Hountondji (35) and  Johannes Hountondji (40) have completed the conversion and preparation  of their new vehicles for the 2021 season of the Drift Masters  European Championship. On 10 and 11 July during the season start of  the series in Greinbach (AUT), the Driftbrothers will be taking the  BMW M4 Competition to the starting grid for the very first time.“I am deeply impressed with what the Red Bull Driftbrothers have  managed to coax out of our vehicles and wish both of them every  success for the start of the season. The result also shows how good a  basis the BMW M4 Competition provides for motorsport use. From the  start of its development, we had designed the production vehicle to  also form the basis for our GT icon, the BMW M4 GT3, which we  officially presented during the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring almost  two weeks ago,” says Markus Flasch, CEO of the BMW M GmbH.Elias and Johannes Hountondji have modified both BMW M4 Competition  models comprehensively in order to adapt them to the special demands  of drifting. They doubled the peak performance of the straight  six-cylinder power unit of the BMW M4 Competition to 1,050 hp and  increased maximum torque to almost 1,300 Nm, this being absolutely  crucial for drifting. Elias Hountondji speaks with admiration for the  production engine’s massive potential. “It is by nature a genuine  racing engine in a road-legal car, so to speak. When you look at each  component of this engine, it is clear that many engineers have put a  lot of thought into creating an optimal design,” the younger of the  two Driftbrothers says. In order to achieve the massive increase in  performance, the two brothers installed, among other things, a  special, particularly efficient cooling circuit along with an  additional second cooler at the rear.Moreover, the aerodynamics were extensively modified and optimised  for drifting. Besides benefitting from their own experience, the  Driftbrothers also relied on the expertise of BMW design experts.  Virtually all newly designed aerodynamics components were manufactured  exclusively at BMW M Prototype Construction. “It was a great honour  for us to collaborate with experts from the design and prototype  construction departments. With their help we were able to implement  our ideas perfectly,” says Johannes Hountondji.For example, the Driftbrothers’ BMW M4 Competition was fitted with a  new BMW kidney grille to optimise the supply of air to the engine compartment.Furthermore, carbon was used to produce a new spoiler lip (gurney)  for the tailgate, side coverings for the rear diffuser and attachments  for the side sills from the M Performance Parts portfolio. These were  complemented by so-called winglets, which optimise airflow at the  front splitter and behind the front wheels as well as in front of the  rear wheels. Should the need arise during the course of the season,  the production of an air scoop for the bonnet would also be possible.Following the season start in Austria, the Red Bull Driftbrothers  will be competing in a further three rounds of the Drift Masters  European Championship, the world’s leading drift series. The second  and the third round will be held in Riga (LAT) on 30\/31 August, the  season finale in Tiflis (GEO) on 4\/5 October.The Red Bull Driftbrothers have participated in the Drift Masters  European Championship since 2018. The 45 best drivers from Europe, the  USA and the Middle East compete in this invitation series. For some  years now, Elias and Johannes Hountondji have ranked among the top  drivers in the drifting scene and were, among other successes, 2017  King of Europe champion and vice champion. In 2016 and 2017, they also  seized the team title there. Moreover, this year, the brothers will be  making guest appearances during the MotoGP race at the Sachsenring  (GER) and the Red Bull Ring (AUT), as well as during the Austrian  Formula 1 Grand Prix, likewise at the Red Bull Ring.\n"}
{"prompt":" Recycling tools at plants in Germany and Austria saves seven tonnes of tungsten per year  Lowers energy consumption by 70% and CO2 emissions by more than 60% compared to primary tungsten  Wendt: “We will significantly increase the percentage of recycled raw materials by 2030 and use raw materials multiple times in a circular economy”  ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is making raw materials  considered to be so-called conflict minerals a special focus of its  sustainability strategy. This includes ores where mining or trading is  often associated with violations of environmental and social  standards. Tungsten is an example of this: Once considered an  irritating by-product of tin mining, since it “ate up” the tin ore, it  took a few hundred years for carbide’s unique properties to be  recognised: heavy like gold, hard as a diamond and dozens of times  more heat-resistant than iron. Today, it can be found in the vibration  alarm of mobile phones and light bulb filaments, as well as drill and  milling bits for industrial machinery used in producing cars.The BMW Group has now created a closed-loop material cycle for this  unique metal and is collecting old drill and milling bits at its  plants in Germany and Austria for recycling. The secondary tungsten  obtained in this way will then be used to manufacture new milling and  drilling tools. This reduces the amount of tungsten required by seven  tonnes per year. Compared to using primary tungsten, this also reduces  energy consumption by 70% and CO2 emissions by more than 60%.“Responsible management of natural resources plays a key role in our  sustainability goals. We plan to increase the percentage of recycled  raw materials significantly by 2030 and use raw materials multiple  times in a circular economy. This applies not only to their use in the  vehicle, but also in value creation overall,” said Dr Andreas Wendt,  member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing  and Supplier Network. He added: “Every gram that conserves natural  resources and doesn’t contribute to violations of environmental and  social standards counts.”The European Union has already implemented corresponding measures: At  the start of 2021, a new “Conflict Minerals Regulation” came into  effect that tightens the rules for importing the four conflict  minerals: gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten. Scrap turned into new toolsCarbide tools are mainly made of tungsten and are used, for example,  at the BMW Group plant in Steyr for the high-precision machining of  e-drive housings. The tools are usually resold as scrap at the end of  their useful life. In June 2021, the BMW Group will gradually begin  collecting this tool scrap from its plants in Germany and Austria for  recycling by the Austrian mining company Wolfram Bergbau und Hütten  AG. Tool scrap contains an average of more than 80% tungsten. This is  then treated using a special method to produce secondary tungsten in  powdered form; the electricity required for this comes from 100%  renewable, local energy sources.This dark grey tungsten powder can then be used to produce new tools.  The BMW Group already demonstrated this material cycle with a small  quantity of tool scrap as part of a pilot project in which tool  manufacturer Gühring KG in Berlin produced new drill and milling bits  from the recycled tungsten. These drill and milling bits are already  being used at BMW Group plants. Following successful implementation of  the pilot project, this material cycle is now being expanded to  include carbide tool scrap at all plants in Germany and Austria. These  plants generate almost nine tonnes of scrap from carbide tools every  year: On average, this contains more than seven tonnes of recyclable  tungsten. About half of this comes from the BMW Group plant in Steyr, Austria. Virtually full transparency over “3TG” supply chain The BMW Group already identified a number of raw materials and other  materials that were especially critical from a sustainability  perspective in its materials strategy back in 2012. The BMW Group  analyses the impact of these priority raw materials on the environment  and society throughout the supply chain on an ongoing basis.The conflict minerals tin,  tantalum, tungsten and  gold – also referred to by their initials as “3TG” –  play a special role here. The BMW Group is aiming for full  transparency for the 3TG supply chain and, together with its  suppliers, already achieved virtually 100% traceability of the 3TG  minerals used in components and tools back in 2019.The BMW Group is also working to steadily increase the percentage of  certified smelting plants in the supply chain. The BMW Group’s  conflict minerals team offers suppliers training, information and  support in this area.The BMW Group is a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative  (RMI) and a driving force for sustainable management of conflict  minerals. To improve its understanding of the processes involved in  mineral processing, BMW Group Purchasing conducts on-site visits to  selected European smelting plants every year. Wolfram Bergbau und  Hütten AG is also a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative.\n"}
{"prompt":" €5.1 million for TUM professorship, equipment and personnel   Bridge between outstanding research and industry application  Great potential of quantum computing for optimisation problems  ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group will in future be supporting  research into quantum computing at the Technical University of Munich  (TUM). Today, Prof. Thomas F. Hofmann, President of TUM, Frank Weber,  Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development, and  Alexander Buresch, CIO of BMW AG, signed an agreement to establish an  endowed chair in “Quantum Algorithms and Applications”. Over a period  of six years, the BMW Group will make a fund of €5.1 million available  to TUM for a professorship, equipment and personnel. By taking this  step, the BMW Group and TUM are seeking to bridge the gap between the  outstanding basic research carried out in Germany and its specific  application in industry. The holder of the chair will conduct applied  research into specific problems and issues in the field of quantum  computing at the same time as establishing an ongoing exchange of  knowledge and findings between TUM and the BMW Group.“It is clear to the BMW Group that quantum computing is a pioneering  technology that holds great potential for a multitude of applications  – from materials research to battery cell chemistry and the future of  automated driving using quantum machine learning,” says Frank  Weber. “This technology is at an early stage of development  and we want to provide the best possible support for cutting-edge  research and its transfer into industrial applications.”“Thanks to this collaboration, the BMW-TUM axis is set to further  strengthen Munich Quantum Valley’s reputation as Germany’s leading  ecosystem for quantum technologies,” comments Prof. Thomas F.  Hofmann. “Quantum computing could hold the key to solving the  sort of complex tasks that are beyond even today’s supercomputers. The  new endowed chair will focus on developing quantum algorithms for this  and on trialling areas of application. The generous funding from the  BMW Group will create the leverage needed to transfer the findings of  quantum physics to industrial applications.”“Close collaboration between research, industry and the startup  landscape is a prerequisite for cost-effective implementation of our  specific use cases,” explains Alexander Buresch. “The  purpose of this is to relay the requirements of industrial  applications so that they can be incorporated into the development of  quantum computing demonstrators. Our team of experts is looking  forward to joining forces with TUM and driving forward this important  field of research while focusing on its practical application.”The creation of the endowed chair underlines how the BMW Group is  endeavouring to further the sustained development of the Munich region  as a high-tech industrial base and is also a key building block for Munich Quantum  Valley, whose various initiatives have received €300 million in  funding from the Bavarian state authorities.TUM and the BMW Group already collaborate closely on a wide variety  of other topics, with notable examples including battery research,  circular economy, automated driving, artificial intelligence in  production and mobility research. On the teaching side, the BMW Group  helps to boost the practical relevance of courses with various guest  lectures and project work, while the company also enjoys a close  partnership with the TUM Institute for Lifelong Learning. Great potential for solving optimisation problems. At the BMW Group, high-performance computers handle some 2,000  computing tasks a day – such as high-end visualisations and crash\/flow  simulations – for approximately 3,000 users from R&D. The bulk of  the computing operations are processed on servers in Iceland and  Sweden that run on hydroelectric and geothermal green energy, reducing  CO2 emissions by around 5,900 tonnes annually. Once a  certain level of computational complexity is reached, however, even  today’s high-performance computers hit their limit, as they process  information using a binary system, just as a laptop or smartphone  would. Bits – a contraction of ‘binary digits’ – have a value of 0 or  1. In the case of quantum computers, the smallest unit of information  is called a quantum bit, or qubit for short. Qubits can be far more  than simply 0 or 1. Phenomena of quantum mechanics, such as the  tunnelling effect, quantum entanglement and quantum interference, are  used to put qubits in superposition, a state in which they can also  assume values between 0 and 1 – and, theoretically, an infinite number  of such values at the same time.The BMW Group recognised the importance of quantum computing as a  pioneering technology for the future back in 2017, prompting it to set  up an interdisciplinary, cross-departmental project team with the task  of identifying potential uses.One of the BMW Group’s first research projects involved calculating  the optimum circuit to be followed by a robot sealing welding seams on  a vehicle. The existence of highly complex parameters means that even  the latest high-performance computers would take years to find the  optimum solution. Quantum computers are capable of computing all the  possible permutations in just a few seconds.The high level of complexity in the automotive value chain gives rise  to various multi-faceted optimisation problems in areas such as  production, parts logistics and vehicle development. It will be  possible to use quantum computers in materials research to simulate  the behaviour of material compositions at a whole new level, for  example when researching new types of battery.Another field of research that is growing in importance is quantum  machine learning, where quantum computers are used to speed up  specific processes of traditional machine learning. These innovative  learning processes for artificial intelligence could be particularly  useful for automated driving, too.\n"}
{"prompt":" Hydrogen as fuel for sustainable mobility: BMW Group continues systematic research and development  First prototypes being tested on European roads  Production of small series based on BMW X5 will launch in 2022  ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is beginning to test  near-standard vehicles with a hydrogen fuel cell drive train in  everyday conditions on European roads. Prototypes of the BMW i  Hydrogen NEXT will examine how effectively the CO2-free  drive train, model-specific chassis technology and vehicle electronics  systems work together under real-life conditions. The BMW i Hydrogen  NEXT is a pure electric vehicle that uses hydrogen as fuel by  converting it into electricity in a fuel cell. The recently launched  testing programme will pave the way for the BMW Group to present a  small-series model with this sustainable drive technology, developed  on the basis of the BMW X5, in late 2022. Extensive field testing of  these vehicles will provide practical experience in the use of this  sustainable drive technology.Hydrogen fuel cell technology has the long-term potential to  supplement internal combustion engines, plug-in hybrid systems and  battery-electric vehicles within the BMW Group’s flexible drive train  strategy. It could become an attractive alternative to  battery-electric drive trains – especially for customers who do not  have their own access to electric charging infrastructure or who  frequently drive long distances. “Hydrogen fuel cell technology can be  an attractive option for sustainable drive trains – especially in  larger vehicle classes,” according to Frank Weber, member of the Board  of Management of BMW AG responsible for Development. “That is why road  testing of near-standard vehicles with a hydrogen fuel cell drive  train is an important milestone in our research and development efforts.”Like the fuel tank of a conventional combustion-engine model, the  hydrogen tank of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT can also be filled within  three to four minutes with a fuel that ensures a range of several  hundred kilometres in all weather conditions. Field testing focused on efficiency, safety, convenience,    reliability – and driving pleasure.A central element of the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT road tests now underway  is fine-tuning the software that controls all driving and operating  functions. The fuel cell system, hydrogen tanks, performance buffer  battery and central vehicle control unit have all previously been  tested individually and together in hundreds of test runs conducted on  test benches. This functional testing is now being followed with field  testing on the roads. The intensive programme, which is conducted  under everyday conditions, with thousands of kilometres driven in real  traffic situations, helps development engineers validate the  efficiency, safety, convenience and reliability of all components. At  the same time, the test series is designed to ensure the  characteristic driving pleasure of BMW models – even with locally  emission-free mobility using pioneering hydrogen fuel cell technology.The BMW i Hydrogen NEXT uses fuel cells from the product development  cooperation with the Toyota Motor Corporation. The individual cells  come from Toyota, while the fuel cell stack and complete drive system  are original BMW Group developments. The cooperation established in  2013 seeks to optimise the everyday practicality and scalability of  hydrogen fuel cell technology for use in each company’s respective  production vehicles through the intensive exchange of experience. Typical BMW driving dynamics delivered by electric drive train    with system output of 275 kW\/374 hp.The complete drive system in the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT combines  hydrogen fuel cell technology with fifth-generation BMW eDrive  technology – which can already be experienced in the BMW iX3 and soon  the BMW iX and BMW i4, as well. Energy is generated in the fuel cell  as the result of a chemical reaction between the hydrogen carried by  the vehicle and oxygen from the air. This delivers an electrical  output of 125 kW\/170 hp. An electric converter located below the fuel  cell adjusts its voltage to that of the electric motor, which powers  the BMW i Hydrogen NEXT.Energy stored in a performance buffer battery is also used for  dynamic acceleration manoeuvres and short bursts of speed for  overtaking. As a result, the system delivers an output of  275 kW\/374 hp that corresponds exactly to that of the most powerful  six-cylinder in-line petrol engine currently used in BMW models –  thereby guaranteeing the driving dynamics the brand is known for.The energy stored in the performance buffer battery is generated in a  particularly efficient way during driving by recovering energy from  coasting overrun and braking phases. The hydrogen needed to supply the  fuel cell is stored in two 700-bar tanks made of carbon-fibre  reinforced plastic (CFRP), which together hold six kilograms of  hydrogen. Its precisely controlled reaction with oxygen in the fuel  cell generates electricity, while water vapour is the only emission  produced by the drive train.\n"}
{"prompt":"Newly designed Safety Training with specially converted vehicles starts in July 2021 and can be booked now. Theory lessons and practical driving exercises in the MINI John Cooper Works as well as in particularly sporty BMW models under the guidance of professional instructors. ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW and MINI Driving Experience is  expanding its offering to include Safety Training for people with  physical disabilities. From July 2021, for the first time, a  driving-oriented programme will be conducted under the guidance of  trained instructors and in specially converted BMW and MINI models.  The choice of vehicles makes it clear that in addition to safe and  confident reactions in different traffic situations, driving fun also  plays a central role. In addition to the MINI John Cooper Works (fuel  consumption combined: 7.1 - 6.8 l\/100 km according to WLTP, 7.1 - 6.9  l\/100 km according to NEDC; CO2 emissions combined: 161 - 155 g\/km  according to WLTP, 163 - 158 g\/km according to NEDC), particularly  sporty BMW models are available for the Safety Training. The practical  driving exercises in the programme range from braking and evasive  manoeuvres to slalom driving on the ideal line and drifting through  controlled oversteering in bends.\"Driving is self-determination and thus also a kind of  freedom,\" says instructor Bettina Schmidt-Kiendl, who is herself  dependent on a wheelchair and was instrumental in the conception of  the new Safety Training. \"With the new programme, we want to give  people with comparable disabilities the joy of driving that I also  live every day.\" To achieve this goal, the training vehicles were  converted so that they can be comfortably steered by hand. Both hands  can remain on the steering wheel at all times. An additional ring on  the steering wheel is used to accelerate. Directly next to it is a  special brake lever. Thanks to these modifications, with a little  practice it is possible to steer both the 170 kW\/231 hp MINI John  Cooper Works and the BMW M3 Competition Sedan (fuel consumption  combined: 9.8 l\/100 km according to WLTP; CO2 emissions combined: 224  - 223 g\/km according to WLTP), which is powered by an inline  six-cylinder engine with 375 kW\/510 hp, confidently and sportily  around the training grounds.The Safety Training for people with disabilities is designed as a  full-day event. Like all BMW and MINI Driving Experience safety  training courses, it is divided into a theoretical and a practical  section. To begin with, the instructors teach the participants  important basics of driving physics and familiarise them with the  converted vehicles. Among other things, they demonstrate the optimal  seating position and the ideal steering wheel position for safe and  sporty driving. This is followed by practical exercises with the MINI  John Cooper Works, the new BMW M3 Competition Sedan and other current models.The ideal conditions for intensive driving safety training are  provided by the BMW and MINI Driving Academy in Maisach near Munich.  There, participants learn to control their vehicle calmly and  skilfully even in surprising situations. Braking and evasive  manoeuvres as well as lane changes with and without deceleration are  practised on different road surfaces. In addition to a slalom course,  the extensive area also includes a circuit and circular surfaces  prepared for highly dynamic driving exercises with controlled  oversteer. In addition to maximum safety and confidence at the wheel,  the participants also gain increased driving pleasure during drift  manoeuvres in sporty curves.The BMW and MINI Driving Experience offers a wide range of training  courses for car and motorbike drivers designed to enhance individual  driving skills. The selection ranges from safety courses for novice  drivers to winter and racetrack training and courses for professional  chauffeurs. With this offer, which has been in place since 1977, the  BMW Group is making an important contribution to increasing road  safety. Under the guidance of professional instructors, training  courses are now offered in more than 30 countries around the world  with current BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad models. All information about the new Safety Training for people with  physical disabilities can be found under: http:\/\/bmw-drivingexperience.com\/en\/trainings\/bmw-driving-experience\/bmw-academy-experience\/safety-training-fpwd.html In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsMarkus Braeuer, Press Spokesperson BMW and MINI  Driving ExperienceTel.: +49-89-382-30327E-mail: markus.br.braeuer@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com Fuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption were    measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC)    2007\/715 as amended.

{"prompt":"In our preview, we present the most important facts and key factors of the Puebla E-Prix. ->","completion":" Munich. After a six-week break, the BMW i Andretti Motorsport    Team this week travels to the Puebla E-Prix (MEX), where races eight    and nine herald the second half of the season in the ABB FIA Formula    E World Championship. The permanent racetrack near the capital    Mexico City is located at 2,300 metres above sea level and is new    territory for all the teams and drivers. Jake Dennis (GBR) and    Maximilian Günther (GER) compete in qualifying groups two and three    on Saturday, as they currently lie tenth and 16th in the    Drivers’ Championship. In our preview, we present the most important    facts and key factors of the Puebla E-Prix. You can find detailed information in our media guide: https:\/\/b.mw\/Formula_E_Media_Guide.  It provides detailed information on the technology behind the BMW i  drivetrain and the BMW iFE.21, background stories on the technology  transfer between motor racing and production development, the BMW i  Andretti Motorsport Team and the drivers as well as the BMW Group  safety car fleet. It is updated with facts and figures on the  respective event after each race weekend. TRACK FACTS PUEBLA.Circuit length2.93 km. Anti-clockwise.Corners16 – 7 right-handers, 9 left-handers.Track surfaceVery undulating for a permanent racetrack.Grip levelMedium. Moderate improvement of            grip expected between qualifying groups.Circuit layoutFast circuit with long straights            and many fast and medium-fast corners. Slipstream will play            an important role. T16 is part of an oval and is            consequently banked. Circuit is located at 2,300 metres            above sea level, meaning lower air pressure. In combination            with high temperatures, will be factor in battery cooling.Tyre wearRelatively high on the right            side, due to banking in T16.Top speedapprox. 245 km\/h.OvertakingVery good overtaking opportunity            coming into T1.Key factorsSet-up for new circuit,            intelligent tyre management, energy management.  Quotes ahead of the Puebla E-Prix: Roger Griffiths (Team Principal BMW i Andretti Motorsport):“We head into the second half of the season on the back of some good  results. The points we scored last time out mean we currently lie  fifth in the Team competition. We now want to close the gap to third  and fourth place. The Puebla circuit is new to us all and is a mix of  an oval circuit and a tight infield. Slipstream will definitely play  an important role on the long start\/finish straight and the home  straight. We are hoping to benefit from the efficiency of the BMW i  drivetrain at what is generally a fast circuit.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21):“We kept working hard during the six-week break. I spent almost the  entire time in Germany and did some work in the BMW Motorsport  simulator to prepare as well as possible for the second half of the  season. The fact that nobody knows the circuit in Puebla is good for  me, as it means that as a rookie I am in the same position as all the  other drivers. The last time that happened was at Valencia – and I won  there. Hopefully we can get a similarly good result in Puebla.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21):“Puebla is a special challenge. The track is very flowing, has a lot  of undulations and will produce some great Formula E racing. The long  full-throttle sections on the start\/finish straight, when we head back  onto the oval, will make the race very interesting. I am really  pleased that the second half of the season is getting underway in Mexico.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race. The five drivers with the most FANBOOST votes receive an extra  100 kJ of power, which they can make use of during a brief time frame  in the second half of the race.

While BMW Motorrad Motorsport celebrated third place    at the ‘24 Heures Motos’ at Le Mans with the BMW Motorrad World    Endurance Team, Sunday did not play out as hoped for the WorldSBK    side of the BMW family at Misano (ITA). The best-placed rider in    race two was Michael van der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad    WorldSBK Team in tenth place. His team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) was    twelfth. Eugene Laverty (IRL \/ RC Squadra Corse), who was given the    go-ahead by doctors this morning after his crash on Saturday, came    home in 15th place to pick up a point. He was followed home in 16th    place by Jonas Folger (GER \/ Bonovo MGM Racing). Misano hosted round    three of the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK). Sykes started Sunday morning’s Superpole race from fifth place on the  grid. He initially found himself in sixth after the start and crossed  the finish line in seventh after ten laps of racing. The second-best  BMW rider in the Superpole race was Laverty in 13th. Van der Mark  consistently worked his way forward from 13th place, but then crashed  out on the sixth lap. Folger, who was running behind him, was forced  to take evasive action and consequently fell back through the field,  eventually ending the Superpole race in 19th place. Van der Mark started race two on Sunday afternoon from 14th place. He  made gradual progress from lap two and crossed the finish line tenth  after 21 laps. Sykes was running sixth until the sixth lap, but then  dropped back to ninth after a battle with his rivals. Shortly after  that, he found himself in twelfth, and went on to cross the finish  line in that position. Laverty also finished in the points in 15th.  Folger was 14th for long stretches of the race, before dropping back  to 16th. Quotes after race two at Misano. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  were definitely not where we expected to be. As such, it was  disappointing. We did not manage to transfer the set-up from one  circuit to the next with either Tom or Michael. The opposition can  clearly do that better than us. All weekend we failed to give our  riders a bike on which they are competitive. In the case of Tom, we  reckoned on him taking eighth place. We must now find out why he fell  so far back. Michael’s poor grid position once again left him with a  mountain to climb. In the closing stages of the race, he was matching  the pace of the seventh and eighth-placed riders. He eventually  finished tenth, but on the whole it was disappointing because we  definitely arrived here with greater expectations. We must work on  being able to transfer a basic set-up from one circuit to the next.  Before the next races at Donington Park we will do some testing at  Navarra, where we will do our homework and work really hard.  Congratulations at this point to the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team  on their third place at Le Mans – respect to the guys. Their success  saved the Sunday a bit for us here at Misano.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It was a really tough weekend for us. We came here with some  high expectations but in the very high grip levels we found it  difficult to get Tom and Michael comfortable on the bike. We had  constant front-end chatter problems. The mechanics and the team worked  all weekend trying to find a good balance; we’ve worked on the bike in  a lot of areas but unfortunately we couldn’t find a setting for them  both. Tenth and 12th doesn’t do the effort justice. We’re a long way  off where we want to be but we have a test at Navarra coming up where  we can check things over and we will see how we can come back stronger  from this. We will be ready and are looking forward to the test at  Navarra and then our home round at Donington.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I  think we should not be really happy with this result. In this  morning’s Superpole race I made a mistake by myself. I entered T1 way  too quick and then I lost it. It was a shame because we tried  something on the bike and we didn’t know if it was better or not. In  race two, I had a not so great start. I had problems at the start and  then I gained some positions back but unfortunately we can be really  consistent but we are just too slow. It’s difficult, but it is like  this now. Soon we will be testing and hopefully we find some solutions.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “To be honest,  it was a difficult day. After the Superpole race we had quite a good  feeling actually but we were missing in some areas and only really  could finish in the top-seven, which for me is not acceptable. So we  tried something with the bike for the big race, but unfortunately that  was not working out. At least we got a lot of information out of it.  It was a difficult race for me and we learned a lot on the back of it  now, so we keep working now. After another test we are going for the  next round to Donington. I would like to think we’ve got the package  to fight for the race there. We need to get on top of the little  issues which we have got, so we hope for another step forward with the  BMW M 1000 RR. For now there will be a disappointing end of the  weekend here at Misano, but we pick ourselves up and try to move on.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “The important  thing is to get back on the horse and that is all today was. I am a  racer and when I feel that I can ride the bike and score one point  then I feel I owe it to my team and to BMW. So to score one point  makes it worth it for me. Today, I was physically far from 100 per  cent but I am happy that I raced because this is the important thing,  to get back on and then recover next week and be ready to come back  100 per cent strong again.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Race two was our  best result here at Misano, at least as far as our speed is concerned.  We felt the heat and the tyre really heated up nicely. After this  morning, we changed the transmission ratio a little which improved  things. I was running really well in the first half of the race and  managed to catch Tom Sykes. However, my front tyre then gave up on me  and I had three slides, which I was able to save. The fourth time,  braking into turn 4, I had a highsider that I only just managed to  save that resulted in me going through the gravel and I lost  positions. It was a shame that we missed out on the points as a result  of that. However, our speed was better and we will take the positives  with us, even though it was a tough weekend.” \n"}

The BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team kicked off the    2021 season in the FIM Endurance World Championship (FIM EWC) with a    podium finish. Markus Reiterberger (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and    Xavi Forés (ESP) made a stunning fightback on the new #37 BMW M 1000    RR to finish third at the ‘24 Heures Motos’ at Le Mans (FRA).  Werner Daemen’s team had previously qualified third. When  the endurance classic got underway at 12:00 (CEST) on Saturday,  Reiterberger made a perfect start and immediately took the lead.  However, shortly after that the BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team  suffered a major set-back. A problem with the fuel system led to  several unscheduled pit stops. The team fell back to a seemingly  forlorn 43rd place, many laps behind the leaders. The team  showed fantastic fighting spirit and the three riders impressed with a  thrilling performance on the M RR. Fast lap times allowed them to  gradually work their way back towards the front of the field, one  position at a time. By the halfway point at midnight, the #37 was  already back in fifth place. Shortly after that, Mikhalchik climbed  into fourth place. On Sunday morning, the BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team found itself third and on course for a podium finish. They  remained in that position until Forés brought the #37 BMW M 1000 RR  home in third place after 24 hours of racing. The two  independent BMW Motorrad Motorsport teams, Team LRP Poland (#90 BMW S  1000 RR) and Team Univers Racing\/AC Racing (#23 BMW S 1000 RR) failed  to finish. Round two of the FIM Endurance World  Championship, the 12-hour race in Estoril (POR), will take place on  17th July. Quotes after the 24 Heures Motos at Le Mans. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport  Director: “Congratulations to the whole BMW Motorrad World  Endurance Team on this fantastic effort. I followed the race from  Misano, where we also line up in the FIM Superbike World Championship  this weekend. However, whenever possible we had the coverage from Le  Mans on the TV and I was in constant contact with the team. After the  strong start from Markus Reiterberger, we unfortunately had an issue  with the fuel system, which saw us drop well back down the field. At  that point, you could have been forgiven for thinking that the race  was over in the first hour. However, Werner Daemen’s team and our  riders Markus, Ilya and Xavi did not stick their heads in the sand and  accepted the challenge. It was fantastic to see how they reeled in the  field from the back and consistently worked their way to the front.  They more than deserved to be stood on the podium at the end of the 24  hours. It is evidence of the team’s ability and fighting spirit. After  the early set-back, that was a good start to the season.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance  Team: “I’m very proud about the result. The race by itself  was not the best start because of Marcus’ small crash. We had some  technical problems, and we lost about eight to nine laps. Then the  riders, and the team made a good job because we were fighting back.  Fortunately we got the third place – much more than we expected after  the first laps. The team worked perfectly together for the whole week,  and we go further like this for Estoril.” Markus Reiterberger: “I felt very honoured to ride at  the start. Even walking to the bike was good, and when I pulled away  it was really good. I really tried not to let the tyres cool and to  save fuel but the tyres were still not right up to temperature, which  really surprised me, as it was really hot. The front wheel ultimately  folded in on me in the penultimate corner and I skidded into the  gravel. I then did two more laps on the damaged bike, but then had to  come into the pits. I feel sorry for the whole team that I made this  mistake. In the end, the crash was not that bad. The main problem was  the technical issues. Once those had been resolved, we were basically  flawless for the rest of the 24 hours. I would like to thank the whole  team for their hard work, and my team-mates for persevering so valiantly.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I don’t need to say a lot of words.  The job is done, and our target has become real. Everyone is happy.  Hard work pays off for everyone from the team, especially for me  because I've been working really hard since last year. Obviously I’m  really happy to stand on the podium with my team and I hope we will  continue the same way in the next races.” Xavi Forés: “It was a really tough race for us. After  the start, we had some issues and had to come to the garage a couple  of times to solve it so we were at the bottom of the timings and then  to make it to the podium felt like a victory for us. We knew that we  are fast with our BMW M 1000 RR but could not automatically expect to  be on the podium after the first hour. I am very grateful to be part  of the team. The entire crew did an amazing job, we continued pushing  and pushing until the end of the race. This third place was also very  important for the championship and now we will give our all at  Estoril. Thanks to all who made this possible.”\n"}

The FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) is at    Misano on the Italian Adriatic coast, this weekend for round three    of the 2021 season. Saturday proved to be a difficult day for BMW    Motorrad Motorsport. Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael van der Mark (NED)    from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team ended the opening race in eighth    and tenth place. Jonas Folger (GER \/ Bonovo MGM Racing) finished    16th, narrowly missing out on points. Eugene Laverty (IRL), riding    for the Italian RC Squadra Corse team, was unable to take part in    Superpole and race one following a crash in the morning’s free    practice session. In Saturday morning’s Superpole, Sykes finished fifth on his BMW M  1000 RR to secure a spot on the second row of the grid. Van der Mark  was 13th, while Folger came home 15th in Superpole. In the race  itself, Sykes was running in the top six until the penultimate lap.  However, he then dropped two places. Right from the word go, van der  Mark set his sights on the top ten, crossing the finish line in tenth  place after 21 laps of racing. Folger was 16th, missing out on the  points by just one-tenth of a second. Fans are permitted in the grandstands at Misano for the first time  this season. They were given a special welcome from the starting grid  by Sykes, van der Mark, Folger and BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director  Marc Bongers – with signs which said “Welcome back Fans. Bentornati.” Following his crash, Laverty was examined in the medical centre at  the circuit and was not given the go-ahead to take his place in race  one. He will now be examined again before the warm-up on Sunday  morning when it will be decided whether or not he may take part in the  Sunday sessions. Quotes after race one at Misano. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “This  Saturday was not our day. We definitely came here with greater  expectations, but it emerged on Friday that we are not close to the  podium places with both riders. Despite this, Tom still performed  strongly. It was a shame that he was unable to hold on to sixth place  in race one. In the case of Michael, it was clear yesterday and today  that we were unable to really give him the right feeling. We will now  analyse everything, but we cannot expect to make a really big jump  forward by tomorrow. Despite this, we will try to get a top-six  result. The only good news to come out of today is that Eugene is  doing relatively well, despite his big crash this morning, and that he  has not broken anything. That is the only positive news.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “It was a very difficult day for us. I think the P6 position  Tom was holding would have been a strong result for us but in the end  he did not have enough tyre to hold off Bautista and Bassani, so it’s  a shame he dropped to P8 as P6 would have been a good result for Tom.  So, we will come back tomorrow, and we will fight again. Michael on  the other hand really struggled; he didn’t look comfortable on the  bike and hasn't found the setting that he can attack with. And if he  can’t attack going through the fast flowing corners he loses so much  time and ends up battling with the company he was with, so he needs to  work hard with his crew overnight and see what we improve on. I think  overall a little bit disappointing but we will come back stronger  tomorrow and hopefully we can improve on these results.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We got a bad  start to the race today and it definitely didn’t help our track  position. We are very strong in some areas of the track but with our  package we still lose in the area where I normally could gain the most  on people. I saw that Alvaro Bautista was coming strong in race one  and I changed my way of riding while still maintaining a respectable  lap time and just kept the door closed as long as I could but  eventually he managed to get through and pushed me a little wide. I  tried to cut back on him which was not achievable and as a result lost  a further spot to Bassani. We didn’t get what we hoped for today, but  overall I feel we are improving our race performance and obviously we  will go back to the drawing board tonight with a slightly different  set up for tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “I’m not really happy with the result. In this morning’s FP3,  we made a good step forward but unfortunately I did not feel as good  in qualifying. So it was P13 on the grid. I had an okay start, but I  especially struggled with the front. To be honest I was just riding  around with a too slow pace. Now we have to sort out some problems; so  we have a lot of work to do for tomorrow.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Unfortunately, we  did not find what we were hoping for this weekend in order to have a  better feel. Our pace was not bad, but I simply don’t have the trust  in the bike to go for it in the opening laps. When I overtook Tito  Rabat in the third-from-last corner, I unfortunately went wide. I just  went for it, but unfortunately did not quite pull it off. Our times  did improve, but it is still not what we were hoping for. Our goal was  to finish in the top ten. Unfortunately, we were a long way off  achieving that. It is a difficult time for us right now, but we are  always trying to make the best of the situation.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “Thank you everyone  for the kind messages and support on social media and of course a big  thank you to all the volunteers, especially the marshals who reacted  so quick and the paramedics who took care about me after my crash this  morning. Fortunately everything is okay. I have had some scans on my  back and my neck, I am pretty stiff and it’s not sure for tomorrow,  but I have a medical check tomorrow morning, so let’s wait and see  if all is clear, so I can race again tomorrow.” \n"}

It will be a very long and  tough race in these temperatures – but we are confident.” Markus Reiterberger: “It was very hot in the first  qualifying session yesterday, and that is apparently something we  struggle with. The bike behaves differently in these temperatures to  during the test in spring. It was cooler today and I was the fastest  man in the team with a 1:35 lap on the new tyre – not the Qualifier.  We all improved and managed to secure third place on the grid. We saw  that we have a slight disadvantage in the heat, but that changes when  it gets cooler. Because of this, we must now consider how to pace the  race tactically. It is definitely going to be a challenging, long and  tough race, but we are feeling positive and excellently prepared.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “I am happy about the result.  Especially today I had a good feeling. The days before I still was  struggling a bit as the temperatures were hotter than during the test  in spring and that was a challenge for us. But the team found good  solutions for the bike, even for hot conditions, and the tyres started  to work quite well. We are confident that we can do a good job. The  important thing is to have a good start and to be constant and stable  and then, when the night comes, it should be our time, because we were  really fast in the cooler temperatures. Let’s hope for a clean race  and that we can finish in a top position after 24 hours.” Xavi Forés: “Qualifying went quite well for us. We  finished in third position and our pace was quite good. But the track  conditions were much hotter than when we were here for testing, so our  bike is working differently. Overall, it was not too bad. All three  riders have been riding on the same pace, which has to be the target  especially for the race. So yes, I am happy. The bike is working as we  want and we have to be clever for the race.

BMW M Motorsport is returning to international    prototype racing. On Thursday, it was confirmed that an LMDh car is    being developed for use in the North American IMSA series. From the    2023 season, this car will allow BMW M Motorsport to compete for    overall race wins at such prestigious classics as Daytona, Sebring    and Road Atlanta (all USA).  “BMW is back on the big motorsport stage,” said Markus Flasch, CEO of  BMW M GmbH. “In entering the LMDh class, BMW M Motorsport is  fulfilling the prerequisites to challenge for overall victory at the  most iconic endurance races in the world from 2023. We will be fully  focussed on tackling this challenge. There is a spirit of optimism  here. BMW has a successful history in prototype racing – the Le Mans  victory in 1999 was unforgettable. Reviving this story in a modern  prototype with M Power will thrill fans of BMW M Motorsport. The LMDh  concept guarantees maximum cost control and offers a wide range of  possible applications, including the IMSA series in North America, an  extremely important market for BMW M. We are all eager to get stuck  into the LMDh category with a compact and highly-efficient team set-up.” Mike Krack, Head of BMW M Motorsport, is responsible for the  development, testing and race outings of the new car. He added:  “Everyone in our motorsport team shares the same motivation: we want  to test ourselves against our strongest opposition at the racetrack –  and to celebrate victories for BMW. As such, the LMDh project is a  real affair of the heart for us and exactly the new challenge we were  hoping for. An extremely exciting project awaits us. To challenge for  overall victories in Daytona and Sebring is a massive motivation. We  have a lot of work ahead of us, but the anticipation is immense.” The regulations for LMDh cars stipulate that they have both a  combustion engine and an electric motor. While each manufacturer may  develop their own combustion engine, the electric motor and battery,  as well as the transmission, are standard parts. The chassis is also  built by an external partner. A BMW M Motorsport works involvement,  with two cars, is planned from the 2023 IMSA season.

{"prompt":"\"Higher Power\" becomes the soundtrack for TV commercials for the debut of the new all-electric BMW models. Kick-off for a long-term cooperation between BMW and the Warner Music mega-band with sustainability as the unifying element. ->","completion":" Munich. Local emission-free driving pleasure has  never been greater than with the first-ever BMW iX and the first-ever  BMW i4. The fitting soundtrack for the debut of the latest  all-electric models is called \"Higher Power\" and comes from  the British band Coldplay. You can hear the quartet's latest single in  the TV commercials filmed for launching the joint worldwide  communication campaign for the two new models. It delivers the perfect  message with the lyric line \"This joy is electric\". The song  for a new era of individual mobility marks the beginning of a  long-term collaboration between BMW and Coldplay.Back in 2014, Coldplay, made up of Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland, Will  Champion and Guy Berryman, performed before 1,500 fans at the end of  their \"Ghost Stories Tour\" at BMW Welt in Munich. On the  basis of the contact established at that time, a creative connection  has now been established between the premium car manufacturer and the  band, which has achieved worldwide success in the charts. This is  based in particular on a common interest in sustainability in various  areas of life.\"In the initial discussions we quickly realised: Coldplay and  BMW share many common goals that go far beyond marketing,\" says  Jens Thiemer, Senior Vice President Customer and Brand BMW.  \"Based on this we developed a real co-creation in which the band  actively contributed their thoughts and attitude to the design of our  campaign for the BMW iX and the BMW i4.\" The shared awareness of  sustainability gave rise to an intensive creative process between BMW  and the British musicians and which will produce further co-created  elements later in the year.For the BMW Group, the premiere of the BMW iX and the BMW i4 is an  important milestone in the current phase of its transformation towards  electric mobility. The company expects all-electric models to account  for at least 50 percent of its global vehicle sales as early as 2030.  The Coldplay musicians are looking for innovative ways to combine  their popularity and performances in front of thousands of  enthusiastic fans with a positive impact with regard to  sustainability. The band said \"We are proud to partner with BMW  as part of our efforts to make everything we do as sustainable as  possible. The technology that BMW use for their electric cars can  power our live performances almost entirely from renewable energy.\"For the premiere of their new song \"Higher Power\", Coldplay  already managed to overcome the usual boundaries of the music  business. Last month, Coldplay premiered \"Higher Power” in space.  The song was played for the first time by French astronaut Thomas  Pesquet on the International Space Station. Shortly after, the band  played its first live set of 2021 for earthly audiences in a special  livestream from the site of Glastonbury Festival.With the launch for the campaign film for the BMW iX and the BMW i4,  fans all over the world can now enjoy the sound of \"Higher  Power\". \"And that's just the beginning,\" announces  Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand Communication and Brand  Experience. \"We are already looking forward to being able to  realise exciting projects with regard to sustainability in an  intensive and substantial collaboration with Coldplay.\" https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=loYO_aNqYOI\n"}

{"prompt":" Consortium of leading corporations creates demand for quantum computing  ->","completion":" Berlin\/Munich. Ten leading German corporations are  jointly founding the Quantum Technology and Application Consortium  (QUTAC). The goal of the newly founded consortium is to further  develop the existing fundamentals of quantum computing into usable  industrial applications.Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG:  \"Quantum computing is one of the most promising future  technologies and can revolutionize application fields from materials  research to automated driving. Germany and Europe need a strong  quantum computing ecosystem to be at the cutting edge of technology  and remain globally competitive. With QUTAC, we are laying the  foundation for a successful ecosystem that will allow us to make the  most of the great potential of quantum computing.\"Specifically, QUTAC will help bring industry-relevant applications to  market for the technology, chemical and pharmaceutical, insurance, and  automotive industries.  This is intended to create the basis for a  successful industrialisation of quantum computing in Germany and  Europe. At the time of its founding, the consortium includes BASF, BMW  Group, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bosch, Infineon, Merck, Munich Re, SAP,  Siemens, and Volkswagen.Foundation stone for a commercially successful quantum    computing ecosystem.„In the Stimulus and Future Package, the German Government has given  a big boost to the development of Quantum Computers. Working together  with companies and start-ups we will identify, develop, trial, and  share applications.

After the 2020 class win in the BMW M4 GT4, the BMW    Junior Team made a strong debut in the BMW M6 GT3 at the 2021    edition of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER). Alongside Augusto Farfus    (BRA), Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and Neil Verhagen (USA)    showed strong speed and fighting spirit in the race, but were not    rewarded with a good result. Despite the disappointment over the    wrong tyre selection at the start and the retirement due to a    technical defect shortly before the end of the race, the general    conclusion of everyone involved is positive. “We went into this race with very ambitious goals and definitely  wanted to get a top-ten result with the BMW Junior Team. For a while  it looked like we might even improve on that goal. A top-five result  was within reach but unfortunately the course of the race ended up  writing a different story,” summed up mentor Jochen Neerpasch. “I  still think that the BMW Junior Team passed the master’s exam with  their performance.” It was a weekend of firsts. Hesse experienced the first of these in  top qualifying when, after Farfus’ perfect groundwork in putting the  #77 BMW M6 GT3 in the pole position shootout, he completed his first  GT3 laps in the rain on the Nordschleife. He mastered this challenge  flawlessly and secured tenth on the grid ahead of many Nürburgring  experts with significantly more experience. “We started the weekend  well and got ourselves a good starting position,” said Hesse. Strong recovery performance after unlucky start.In light of the extremely difficult track conditions, at the start of  the race BMW Team RMG and starting driver Farfus opted for the wrong  tyres for their 24-hours debut with the BMW M6 GT3. Farfus pitted  right after the formation lap and was given wet tyres – a 50\/50  decision since some sections of the track were wet and some were dry.  Unfortunately heavier rain didn’t start until so much later that  Farfus was unable to keep using his wet tyres and make up the time he  lost due to the pit stop. “It was really difficult to gauge the  weather conditions at the start, and unfortunately we opted for the  wrong tyres,” said team principal Stefan Reinhold. After that, things went very well until the race was red-flagged on  Saturday evening due to fog, and again after the restart on Sunday.  Flawless stints saw Farfus, Hesse and Harper move up the field. “Up  until the red flag and again after the restart our strategy was aimed  at making up as much ground as possible which we managed,” explained  Reinhold. Verhagen experienced his first at the restart; he had never  done a flying start in the GT3 car before. He did a great job, and  showed strong speed and courageous overtaking manoeuvres in his  ensuing stint. Up until 30 minutes before the end of the race, the BMW Junior Team  had fought its way back into the top ten, and if they hadn’t been  awarded a time penalty for Verhagen coming into contact with another  car, they would have even made it into the top five. But then a  technical defect and a subsequent collision forced the #77 BMW M6 GT3  out the race. “Augusto suddenly no longer had any propulsion in a fast  sector, which meant that he was in the way of the cars behind him,”  said Reinhold, summarising: “Obviously, we envisaged our first  appearance at the Nürburgring a little differently. We learned a lot  of lessons in this race, which hopefully we will be able to build on soon.” Juniors draw positive conclusions.With all the disappointment immediately after the retirement, the  Juniors also ended up drawing positive conclusions. “This race was a  roller coaster ride for us. Obviously, the final result is  disappointing, but our race pace was very strong,” said Harper. Hesse  added: “Even though we didn’t achieve anything measurable in the end,  we can be pleased with our 24-hour debut in the GT3 car. After our  wrong tyre selection at the start, BMW Team RMG did a magnificent job  in terms of pit stops and strategy, and got us to the front of the  field again. Having Augusto in the team was fantastic for us Juniors.” On behalf of the whole BMW Junior Team, Verhagen said: “Many thanks  to everyone who made this race possible. Above all, thanks to BMW Team  RMG, who took on this huge challenge with us and did an outstanding  job during the preparation already. An equally big thank you goes to  Augusto, who was incredibly helpful at making us really fast on the  Nordschleife. This event was an amazing experience. We learned a great  deal and will hopefully come back even stronger.” Farfus: “I really enjoyed the collaboration.”Farfus, who has worked closely with the BMW Junior Team throughout  the season, sees the project as very positive: “It’s a real shame that  we were unable to bring home the race result that we deserved, but all  in all the teamwork with the BMW Junior Team and BMW Team RMG was  fantastic. BMW M Motorsport has made a fantastic selection with Dan,  Max and Neil. They are all incredibly fast. When it comes to speed  they don’t really need my help, but I think I was able to help them a  lot in other areas, such as processes during the race, preparation,  set-up of the car and handling the traffic on the Nordschleife. I  really enjoyed the collaboration.” For Harper, Hesse and Verhagen, the Nordschleife season continues on  26th June with the fourth race of the Nürburgring Endurance Series season.\n"}

He began his theatre career in the dramaturge  team under Gerard Mortier at the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels,  moving from here to the Festival of Flanders, where was appointed  Artistic Director in 1987. He revitalised the festival programme with  a new repertoire and an innovative oﬀering of baroque and  contemporary, invited big, signiﬁcant orchestras and engaged a series  of conductors starting out on their careers, among them Iván Fischer,  Valery Gergiev, Simon Rattle and Esa-Pekka Salonen, for example. He  was appointed General Director and Artistic Director of the London  Philharmonic Orchestra in 1996, where he corrected the ﬁnancial  situation and re-established the orchestra’s artistic excellence. Kurt  Masur was made Principal Conductor and Vladimir Jurowski was appointed  Principal Guest Conductor, and the cooperation with Bernard Haitink,  Mariss Jansons and Wolfgang Sawallisch was intensified. Serge Dorny  has pursued an innovative artistic policy since his appointment as  General Director of the Opéra national de Lyon in 2003. His bills has  combined major works of the repertoire with lesser-known operas,  developed thematic festivals and aﬀorded the music of the 20th century  and contemporary works a truly special signiﬁcance. He has invited  outstanding conductors such as William Christie, Lothar Koenigs,  Stefano Montanari, Kazushi Ono, Kirill Petrenko, Jérémie Rhorer and  Daniele Rustioni, recruited ﬁlm and theatre directors such as  Christophe Honoré, David Marton and Wajdi Mouawad for the opera, and  established a continuous cooperation with renowned stage artistes such  as Romeo Castellucci, Robert Lepage, La Fura dels Baus (Àlex Ollé),  Laurent Pelly, Olivier Py and Dmitri Tcherniakov. His initiative to  make the opera house’s artistic oﬀering accessible to audiences that  previously had very few points of contact with musical theatre, and to  bring them closer with special activities, such as the regular art and  culture programme, now enjoys international renown here. In 2017, the  Opéra national de Lyon was named Opera House of the Year by the  British press’s International Opera Awards and also declared Opera  House of the Year with the “Opernwelt” specialist opera journal’s  critics' vote.

After the double-header in Spain and Portugal, BMW    Motorrad Motorsport is now heading to the third round of the FIM    Superbike World Championship 2021 (WorldSBK) at Misano, Italy. The    circuit on the Adriatic coast has proved to be a happy hunting    ground in the past. In 2019, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and Tom    Sykes (GBR) celebrated the first podium finish there for a WorldSBK    project that was still in its infancy. The Misano race did not take    place last year due to the Coronavirus pandemic. BMW Motorrad Motorsport is now hoping to build on that successful  2019 appearance at Misano with the new BMW M 1000 RR, which is in its  first season as the WorldSBK race bike. Sykes will be joined by  Michael van der Mark (NED) in the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team. Misano  is the home race for the BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse. Eugene  Laverty (IRL) is competing for the Italian team. Jonas Folger (GER)  from the BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing is also very familiar  with the circuit. Quotes ahead of the Misano round. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  are heading to Misano with plenty of optimism. The first two races of  the season at MotorLand Aragón and Estoril took place on circuits that  we already knew would be challenging for us. Nonetheless, we were able  to record some satisfying results, and even more importantly, we were  able to test our new BMW M 1000 RR extensively under racing  conditions. We know where our strengths lie and where we still have  some work to do. In Misano, the situation is completely different to  how it was at the first two circuits on the calendar. We have some  good memories of Misano and were able to show that how much we like  this circuit at the last race there in 2019. Of course, we will never  forget the first podium finish with Tom. Now we are confident that we  can put on a strong performance at Misano with the new M RR.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “First of all, we are delighted to return to Misano after  missing out last year. For sure, 2019 was a very good event for the  BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team and now to return with the BMW M 1000 RR  will be good to compare our improvements. Hopefully we can repeat that  success from 2019. We are going into the weekend both Michael and Tom  coming back from Estoril with some new direction. For sure, Michael is  starting to feel very acclimatised with his electronic feel of his M  RR and that’s really important. He is really starting to feel like the  bike can do exactly what he wants and that's a good step for him so  his confidence is very strong in that area. On the other side, Tom  still has some concerns over his chassis direction and we will work on  that in Friday’s practices. But hopefully quickly Tom can get into a  good rhythm and can prepare himself ready for Superpole and the races.  We hope we can get some good conditions in the weather and we have  some straight forward races with no weather causing any issues because  the forecast predicts some thunderstorms around that time. Overall as  a team, we are happy to return, we feel quite confident that the  Misano circuit should be favourable for us and we are ready to get on track.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “Misano is one of my favourite tracks. I really missed going  there last year. I love the circuit, I love the layout and I am  looking forward to it. It’s a completely different track again  compared to Aragón and Estoril but I think it will suit the BMW very  well and especially the way the bike is working now. After some good  results at Aragón and Estoril a very different track and I think we  can do really well there. Regarding goals for the weekend, I think it  is still difficult to say where we expect to be but I think we should  be close to the top five. We had some good results, the gap is still a  little bit too big but I think the way the Misano track is we can do  really well.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am  obviously looking very much forward to the Misano round of the  WorldSBK calendar. It’s a circuit I really enjoy. It will certainly be  tight in terms of lap times as it is quite small and twisty so we’re  really looking to be competitive. We’ve had some strong results there  in the past with the BMW S 1000 RR so hopefully with the updated M RR  we can improve on those. That’s certainly my target and it would be  fantastic.  We’ve had a podium success there so if we could do  something similar this weekend it’s what we need. Overall, it’s a  fantastic location and I am looking forward to getting out there.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “I’m heading to  Misano feeling very optimistic. I set modest goals for myself last  time out due to the fact that Estoril was the toughest track on the  calendar for us last year. However, I far exceeded my expectations so  my confidence is high going to a track that I really enjoy. The new  BMW M 1000 RR has made a huge step forward this year and I’m very  thankful for the hard work done by everybody at BMW Motorrad  Motorsport during the winter months. I have gelled very well with my  new team RC Squadra Corse and we’re ready to begin moving up the  order. The first two rounds were like pre-season testing for us. I  feel that our season begins properly at round three at Misano.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I am looking  forward to Misano. It will be interesting to see how the BMW M 1000 RR  feels on this circuit. I am hoping for a consistent weekend, and that  we can finish in good positions. I think we will be satisfied with  that. I also hope that we can settle on the right basic set-up for the  bike at Misano which we can then use in the other races.”  Track Facts Misano.Circuit        length4.226          km – clockwiseCorners16 – 10 right-handers, 6 left-handersPole        positionRightLongest        straight510          metres (start-finish straight)Grip levelMediumTrack        layoutSeveral long straights, partly fast corners,          hard braking zonesStrain on        brakesMediumAmount at full        throttle30 %Topspeed \/ lowest        speed276          km\/h \/ 55 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityT1, T8Key        factorsGood          feeling on the brakes, stability, traction \n"}
{"prompt":"After claiming victory last year, ROWE Racing reached the podium once again at the 49th edition of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER).  ->","completion":" Nürburgring. After claiming victory last year, ROWE Racing    reached the podium once again at the 49th edition of the Nürburgring    24 Hours (GER). At the farewell appearance of the BMW M6 GT3, which    will be replaced by the BMW M4 GT3 in 2022, Sheldon van der Linde    (RSA), Martin Tomczyk (GER), Marco Wittmann (GER) and Connor De    Phillippi (USA) finished second in the #98 car. Having started from    25th on the grid, the quartet put on an impressive recovery    performance and crossed the finish line just 8.8 seconds behind the    victorious Porsche. This proved to be the shortest-ever edition of    the race after thick fog interrupted the event for more than 14 hours. On Saturday afternoon, Tomczyk had laid the foundations for success  in difficult conditions featuring soaking-wet sections of track as  well as dry areas. He moved up from 25th position to third place  during his double stint. In the final stage after the restart around  midday on Sunday, van der Linde was involved in a thrilling duel for  victory with the #911 Porsche. In the end, ROWE Racing was not even  ten seconds away from defending their title. The team’s #1 car, with  Nick Catsburg (NED), Nick Yelloly (GBR), John Edwards (USA) and  Philipp Eng (AUT) at the wheel, started from pole position and led the  field for the restart, but then fell back when regulations required a  long pit stop after the red flag on Saturday evening. Shortly  thereafter, the car was forced to retire due to a technical defect. Schubert Motorsport also gave a strong performance. Jens Klingmann  (GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN), Alexander Sims (GBR) and Stef Dusseldorp  (NED) were on course for a podium finish for some time but then  suffered some bad luck with Code 60 periods in the final stage and  crossed the line in sixth place. BMW Junior Team was unrewarded for a strong debut in the BMW M6 GT3  at the Nürburgring 24 Hours. Dan Harper (GBR), Max Hesse (GER) and  Neil Verhagen (USA) were joined by Augusto Farfus (BRA) as they worked  their way back to the top ten thanks to some great lap times after  selecting the wrong tyres at the start of the race. However, Farfus  started to struggle with technical problems 30 minutes from the end  and was hit from behind by another car as he slowed down. That marked  the end of the race for the BMW Team RMG #77 BMW M6 GT3. Walkenhorst  Motorsport put two of its BMW M6 GT3s in the top 20, finishing in  twelfth and 15th. BMW M CEO Markus Flasch (AUT) finished fourth in the CUP5 class with  the #241 BMW M2 CS Racing. Competing for Adrenalin Motorsport, he  shared the car with Jörg Weidinger, Matthias Malmedie and Niki Schelle  (all GER). Reactions after the race: Markus Flasch (CEO BMW M GmbH): “What a race for the  BMW M Motorsport family! We are delighted with this second place for  the BMW M6 GT3 and the ROWE Racing team. Congratulations to the team  and the drivers of the #98 car. They showed how strong the BMW M6 GT3  remains, even at this age, and that it can still battle for victory.  Unfortunately, their team-mates endured some bad luck with the #1 car  and had been among the favourites to win the race. The Schubert  Motorsport car was also involved in the battle for a podium result for  a long period. We had a very good set-up at the top. BMW Junior Team  also gave a strong performance until being forced to retire just  before the end of the race. Congratulations to the lads and Augusto  Farfus for a strong performance. It was definitely a fine way for the  BMW M6 GT3 to mark its farewell at this classic event. At the same  time, we are also really looking forward to the BMW M4 GT3, which we  presented here at the Nürburgring this weekend. We will be competing  with the new car at this race in the future. This will put us back on  the attack. Personally, I had a lot of fun getting out on the track in  this race with the BMW M2 CS Racing. That was a unique experience. I  would certainly not rule out competing again in 2022. I would also  like to thank the many other BMW M Motorsport teams who celebrated  class wins and gave a great battling performance. We are very proud of  the BMW M Motorsport family at the Nürburgring. And of course, the  same also applies to the huge BMW M fan community for their superb  support. Congratulations to Porsche and the Manthey team on their  overall win.” Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “Once again,  that was anything but a normal race here at the Nürburgring. We made  it through the difficult opening stage really well. When the race was  stopped, we had three cars in the top six but the interruption lasted  for a very long time. Race control definitely made the right decision.  We then had a three-and-a-half-hour sprint race. Unfortunately, we  lost two cars due to technical problems, while the Schubert team and  the #98 from ROWE Racing were battling for podiums and the win.  Overall, our drivers and teams gave a faultless performance under the  most challenging conditions. Congratulations to the Manthey team on  their win.” Hans-Peter Naundorf (ROWE Racing team principal): “We  reached the podium thanks to a fantastically good performance from our  drivers. The conditions in the opening stage were extremely difficult,  however, the #98 car was still able to make great progress. Martin’s  starting stint was sensational - it was like seeing the rain god  walking on water. Sheldon was in the car for nearly three hours at the  end and he applied some great pressure. The race was just a bit too  short for us. We might have been able to achieve more over the full  distance. The #1 car also gave a great performance but unfortunately a  technical defect ended its race.” Martin Tomczyk (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 2nd  place): “After qualifying, we would never have expected to  move to the front so quickly during the race. It is always wonderful  to stand on the podium at this 24-hour race. The ROWE Racing team, BMW  M Motorsport and my three fellow drivers all put so much work into  this race. We have been rewarded for that. It was so much fun. A great  result, and one that I was not really expecting.” Sheldon van der Linde (#98 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Racing, 2nd  place): “Considering our grid position, that is an  unbelievable result. I could see the Manthey Porsche on Döttinger  Höhe. It was so tight. Of course, it does hurt a little but we really  should not be disappointed. My triple stint at the end was not half  bad, I really gave it everything. But it was not to be.  Congratulations to Manthey, they earned the win.” Marco Wittmann (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 2nd  place): “In the end, we can be very pleased with that second  place, even though it is a little disappointing to finish not even ten  seconds behind the winners. When we started from 25th on the grid on  Saturday, we had no expectation of finishing the race on the podium.  It was Martin Tomczyk who put us in this position with his  unbelievable opening double stint. In general, we worked really well  as a team. That is my first podium at a 24-hour race. I am really  pleased with that.” Connor De Phillippi (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 2nd  place): “I am grateful for having been part of such a great  team. I think that our car had the potential to win but the conditions  were unbelievably tough at times. In the end, luck was not entirely on  our side but I am sure we will get another chance.” Jesse Krohn (#20 BMW M6 GT3, Schubert Motorsport, 6th  place): “Our car was definitely good enough for the podium  but luck was just not on our side. We had two Code 60 periods towards  the end of the race, which our rivals did not have. That cost us a lot  of time and you can’t make it back up. Nonetheless, we are happy to  have made it to the finish. But we could have done better.” Neil Verhagen (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team, DNF):  “I think that this 24-hour race on the Nordschleife is the most fun  I’ve ever had in a racing car in all my life. You are simply always  driving right on the limit here. I have never experienced anything  like it at any other circuit. Being able to drive the restart after  the interruption was a major highlight for me. I just gave it  everything and had tunnel vision. My first 24-hour race in a GT3 car  was just crazy. It’s a shame that we couldn’t get the car to the  finish line in the end.” Philipp Eng (#1 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, DNF): “We  were doing really well. Our starting drivers in particular, Nick and  Martin in the other car, did a phenomenal job of keeping the cars on  the track during this difficult stage. Unfortunately, the red flag  with the new regulation for the time required for a pit stop did not  help us at all. We had to stay there for an unbelievably long time and  then we knew we would have to drive right on the limit. I don’t think  we have often pushed as hard on the Nordschleife as we did today, but  then we had a technical issue. I no longer had full power and had to  retire the car.”\n"}

The BMW M Motorsport teams managed to avoid any    accidents during the turbulent opening stage of the Nürburgring 24    Hours (GER) and are battling for top positions after four hours of    racing. Heavy rain on parts of the Nordschleife and dry stretches in    in other areas made tyre selection extremely difficult. Both ROWE    Racing and Schubert Motorsport displayed a knack for making the    right choice. The three cars for the two teams are now in the top    five on a much drier track. The chasing performance given by Martin    Tomczyk (GER) was particularly impressive, as the starting driver in    the #98 BMW M6 GT3 from ROWE Racing moved up from 25th on the grid    to third place.  BMW Junior Team endured some poor luck in the opening stage however.  Together with BMW Team RMG, Augusto Farfus (BRA) decided to switch to  wet-weather tyres immediately after the formation lap. That proved to  be a premature decision, as the expected rain did not appear straight  away. An additional pit stop pushed the #77 BMW M6 GT3 further back.  The best-placed Walkenhorst Motorsport car is the #102 BMW M6 GT3.  Like the BMW Junior Team car, it is still in the top 20. The #241 BMW M2 CS Racing, featuring BMW M CEO Markus Flasch (AUT) at  the wheel, lost time due to a break for repairs and is in fifth place  in the CUP5 class. Reactions from the drivers: Nick Catsburg (#1 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “I think  I aged by about five years in those two hours after the start. With  the type of wet-weather tyres that we had put on, it was extremely  difficult to keep the car on the track through those wet passages.  That’s why I was very careful and lost some time in that phase. Things  got better as the track dried out. The main thing is that I was able  to get the car back and we are still right in the race.” Martin Tomczyk (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “I had  an unbelievable amount of fun during my chase. It was my first race in  the rain on the Nordschleife for about a year but our preparations  with the car were outstanding and I was able to show that you are not  on the scrapheap at 39 years of age. I have the experience and I know  where the standing water is most likely to be in these conditions, and  where I have to be careful.” Jens Klingmann (#20 BMW M6 GT3, Schubert Motorsport):  “I am proud that we were able to manage this opening stage so well. It  was very difficult out there, especially during the first laps after  our switch to wet-weather tyres. We did not risk it all, as you have  it all to lose during the opening phase of such a long race.  Unfortunately, we lost a few seconds during the pit stop but there is  still a long way to go in the race. We will catch up.” Augusto Farfus (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team):  “Unfortunately, we made the wrong decision at the start. We thought  that it would rain a bit more right from the word go, and we switched  to wet-weather tyres after the formation lap. We took a risk that  sadly did not pay off. The pace was good in my second stint, but we  had already lost a lot of ground by that point. That is a real shame,  but there is plenty of racing left and we will give it our all.”\n"}

Jesse Krohn (FIN) finished fourth    in the Schubert Motorsport #20 BMW M6 GT3, while Max Hesse (GER) was    tenth in the #77 BMW M6 GT3 of the BMW Junior Team. Just before the    start of Top Qualifying, the lap of honour for the BMW M3    ‘Eifelblitz’ in memory of Sabine Schmitz ensured a sensational atmosphere. While the track was still dry, Augusto Farfus (BRA) had  put the BMW Junior Team in a position to battle for the top ten by  recording the third-fastest time in the first part of Top Qualifying,  thereby qualifying for the top 20 shootout. Hesse then held his nerve  as stormy weather led to extremely challenging track  conditions. The session went even better for Yelloly, who  coped best with the conditions to lap more than two seconds faster  than the second-placed car. A strong performance in the individual  time trial put Krohn in third place for some time, but he was still  pleased to finish fourth and secure a spot on the second row of the  grid. The Walkenhorst Motorsport #100 car competing in the  Pro-Am class had also made it into Top Qualifying 2, but chose not to  appear for safety reasons and was classified in 20th position.

Johannes Scheid, who won the  24-hour race together with Schmitz in 1996 and 1997 at the wheel of  the BMW M3 ‘Eifelblitz’, completed a lap of honour around the  Nordschleife in a replica of the winning car from 1996. It started in  the pit lane, accompanied by applause from the other teams and  drivers, who emerged from their pit areas to form a guard of honour  for the ‘Eifelblitz’. “It was very emotional to first see everyone in  the pit lane and then the track marshals along the circuit, who had  even made their own banners,” said Scheid after his lap. “I said to  Sabine: ‘They are all there for you’. It was very moving. It still  gives me a chill just to think about it. We owed it to her and I think  it is fantastic that BMW made it possible.” Reactions to Top Qualifying: Mike Krack (Head of BMW M Motorsport): “The  conditions for qualifying today were extremely difficult and we are  very pleased with the BMW performance. Last year’s winners ROWE Racing  and Nick Yelloly in pole position after an outstanding display of  driving, Jesse Krohn in fourth place in the BMW M6 GT3 from Schubert  Motorsport and Max Hesse in the BMW Junior Team car, which Augusto  Farfus got out of Q1 and into Q2, in tenth position – that was a  superb performance. But that is just the beginning. We have a very  long race ahead of us, and it will all be about making a few errors as  possible. Today, the Nordschleife has already shown that you can  always expect unpredictable weather conditions and it will be no  different tomorrow. And you have to consider the strength of the  competition. We have a mature and reliable car in the form of the BMW  M6 GT3, we have very good teams and we have very good drivers.  Together, we will attempt to get the very best out of this. We are  looking forward to this race.“ Nick Yelloly (#1 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing, 1st place):  “I am very, very happy to bring that pole home for BMW. Obviously  after last year’s event, when we managed to win, to start off like  this is just superb. I couldn’t picture a better start to the weekend.  It was pretty tricky and slippery out there but it worked out. Now  it’s all about focusing for the race. We know that it is going to be  mixed conditions so we have to be very good and on top of our game in  terms of calling the right pit strategy and tyre choice. But the team  were amazing, as were BMW, last year in doing so, so there is no  reason why we can’t do it again.” Jesse Krohn (#20 BMW M6 GT3, Schubert Motorsport, 4th  place): “I am very happy. Obviously starting in the top ten  is quite important in this race and we managed to qualify in the top  five so I can be happy especially as I can’t even remember the last  time I drove here on the wet and many of the other guys drove a lot  here last year so in that sense they had a bit of an advantage. But I  just went to the risk level that I was comfortable with, that I knew I  can do a good job with and not risk the car. Because tomorrow is the  big day, today was just one step to the goal.” Max Hesse (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team, 10th  place): “Mega! That was the first time I had ever driven any  laps in the GT3 car in the rain. From the start, I realised that it  would not be an easy task. But overall, we are of course super happy  with tenth place. It's our first top ten result at our first 24-hour  race in the GT3. A big thank you to Augusto as well; his Q1 lap was  really great. The lads did a super job and the car went perfectly. All  four of us feel really good in the car and now it is all about  focusing on the race, we still have 24 hours of driving ahead of us.” Augusto Farfus (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team, 10th  place): “It is awesome! Considering that Max has never tried  a GT3 in the wet, he did a superb job. I am very proud of what we have  done. Top Qualifying 1 was not an easy one because there was no room  for mistakes so we did do a good job and went through to Q2. Then Max  did a great job. We have three BMWs in the top ten – it could not be  any better.”\n"}

For    Werner Daemen’s team it is their second year in the endurance world    championship after a strong maiden season. The new #37 bike in    action is the BMW M 1000 RR. The regular riders Markus Reiterberger    (GER), Ilya Mikhalchik (UKR) and Xavi Forés (ESP), as well as Kenny    Foray (FRA) as the fourth rider make for an experienced, strong    rider line-up. BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team prepared the new M RR for its race  appearances in the FIM EWC with intensive test rides. At the official  Pré-Mans Test at the end of March, the team set the best time with new  record laps with the #37 BMW M 1000 RR on both days and is now eager  to build on that performance at the first race weekend of the season. The FIM EWC 2021 consists of four events in France, Portugal and  Japan. After the opener at Le Mans, the season continues on 17th July  with the 12 Hours of Estoril in Portugal. The 24-hour classic ‘Bol  d’Or’ will be held at Le Castellet (FRA) on 18th\/19th September,  before the season draws to a close with the 8-hour race at Suzuka,  Japan on 7th November. Quotes ahead of the Le Mans season opener. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “After the long winter break, the FIM EWC is finally  returning to action. BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team’s maiden season  was a strong one, and with our new BMW M 1000 RR we are now taking the  next step in the endurance world championship as well. The bike has  undergone further optimisations in many areas. In collaboration with  our partner Dunlop, we also spent the break developing some very good  new tyre options. Another very important point is our strong and very  well-oiled rider line-up. We confirmed the potential of our bike as  well as the team and riders in impressive fashion at the Le Mans  pre-test. Now we need to make use of this in the race as well. It goes  without saying that endurance racing, and 24-hour races in particular,  have their own peculiarities. But we and the team have done everything  to make sure we are as well-prepared as possible.” Werner Daemen, Team Manager BMW Motorrad World Endurance Team:  “I think that we are better prepared for Le Mans than last  year, so I’m expecting a good result. We are very happy with the new  BMW M 1000 RR and the pre-test at Le Mans was superb for us. All our  riders are in top form. We are ideally positioned with Ilya, Markus  and Xavi as our regular trio, and I can honestly say that with Kenny  we have the fastest reserve rider in the world. He proved that once  again last weekend, when he finished second in the French  championship. Now the team is working on fine-tuning every detail. I’m  looking forward to the race, and if everything goes according to plan,  we should be up there at the front.” Markus Reiterberger: “I’m delighted that we can  finally race again. We made full preparations at the tests. The whole  team did a fantastic job. We saw that our bike works really well and  always knew the direction in which we needed to make changes. Our  rider line-up is incredibly strong and during the tests we saw that we  are working at a very high level. We were the clear number one at Le  Mans which makes us optimistic. Now, I’m hoping that we can make good  use of the experience we gained from the tests in the race. We are  well-prepared and are aiming to get through the 24 hours safely and  without any errors. Now, it is important to focus on our race pace  once again in the practice sessions and to have good qualifying  sessions. I’m confident and am really looking forward to a fantastic  race weekend at Le Mans.” Xavi Forés: “I am really looking forward to starting  the FIM EWC season at Le Mans. We tested there a couple of times, and  overall it was quite good. All three of us were doing the same fast  lap times under the lap record. This is really important for us and  means that we have a strong and consistent package. If the weather  stays like we want it to, we can definitely fight for the victory.  That has to be the goal and there would be no better way to start the  season and to represent the new BMW M 1000 RR. So we are ready to  start the season.” Ilya Mikhalchik: “After the strong tests at Le Mans  it looks like we are ready for the race. The speed was really  incredible and all of us riders were fast. I will try to continue this  pace and feeling on the race weekend and finish it at the same level.  I am looking forward to the weekend, to great teamwork in BMW Motorrad  World Endurance Team and to bringing BMW to the top.” Kenny Foray: “I am looking forward to Le Mans. I  think everyone is ready to achieve a good result. The new bike, the  BMW M 1000 RR, is really fast and consistent. I will give everything  to support my team as best as I can and I am really happy to be part  of the team.” \n"}

The BMW M4 GT3 will contest its first race on 26th June at round four of the Nürburgring Endurance Series (NLS).  ->","completion":" Munich. The curtain is raised on the BMW M4 GT3 in its new BMW    M Motorsport design: ahead of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER), BMW’s    new GT flagship was revealed in its new livery, heralding the final    phase of testing. The BMW M4 GT3 will contest its first race on    26th June at round four of the Nürburgring Endurance    Series (NLS). The purchase price for the car, which has undergone    significant improvements in the areas of driveability, cost    efficiency and operation, will be € 415,000 net. You can find our    Media Guide with detailed data and facts on the development of the    BMW M4 GT3 attached to this press release and in the BMW Group Pressclub. “The development work on the BMW M4 GT3 is now on the finishing  straight, and the 24-hour race at the Nürburgring is the perfect stage  on which to present the car in its BMW M Motorsport design and thus to  herald the final phase leading up to the first race outings,” said  Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH. “The new BMW M4 Competition (fuel  consumption combined: 10.2 – 9.9 l\/100 km acc. WLTP, 10.2 l\/100 km  acc. NEDC; CO2 emissions combined: 233 – 227 g\/km acc.  WLTP, 234 g\/km acc. NEDC) provides the perfect basis for the BMW M4  GT3, whose engine was designed from the outset for use at the  racetrack. This underlines how road car and race car development  always go hand in hand at BMW M GmbH. The new car offers  state-of-the-art technology, thanks to our technology partners. They  are among the best in their respective fields, and we are delighted to  have them supporting us on the development of the BMW M4 GT3 with  their specific know-how and areas of expertise. That is the perfect  basis for a successful new race car.” Since the start of 2020, the BMW M4 GT3 has undergone many stages of  development. This began virtually with CAD and CFD simulations, and  continued with the use of an engine on the test bench, the assembly of  the test chassis and work in the wind tunnel. One milestone was the  roll-out on 18th July 2020. This was followed by many tests  at various racetracks, at which many BMW works drivers made valuable  contributions. In December 2020, at the BMW SIM Live Event, Philipp  Eng (AUT) demonstrated the steering wheel for the BMW M4 GT3, which  was developed together with FANATEC. It is the first steering wheel in  the world that can be used in both a real race car and a simulator  without modifications. In 2021, the test work continued in Monteblanco (ESP), Almeria (ESP)  and on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife (GER). The car currently has more  than 14,000 test kilometres under its belt – that is the equivalent of  more than 70 hours of track time. Throughout this phase, the BMW M  Motorsport engineers worked hard to improve the driveability and  reliability of the car on its way to being race-ready. The goal: to  significantly reduce lifecycle costs and maintenance expenditure  compared to its predecessor. Following the launch and race debut in  June, the BMW M4 GT3 will undergo more tests and race outings before  it is delivered to the first customers, who will compete with the car  all over the world in 2022. The biggest improvements compared to its predecessor, the BMW M6 GT3,  are in three areas: driveability, cost efficiency and operation. The  BMW M4 GT3’s handling and cockpit equipment are more comfortable for  amateur drivers, while the car is easier on the tyres and offers  greater consistency. Far lower lifecycle costs and longer maintenance  intervals for the engine and transmission are vital economic factors.  Operating the car has been made far easier by the fact that many basic  settings can be configured directly via the steering wheel, without  having to connect an external laptop. The purchase price of the BMW M4 GT3 starts at € 415,000 net – €  4,000 less than the price of its predecessor, the BMW M6 GT3, and  roughly the same as its competitors. The ‘Competition Package’ is  available as an option ex factory for an additional charge. This  includes useful optional features, integrated and tested specifically  for use in endurance races. As a special extra, the package includes  an exclusive training day in an in-house BMW M4 GT3 simulator. Comparison of the BMW M4 GT3 and BMW M6 GT3: Dimensions:Technical data:\n"}

{"prompt":"It was the venue for spectacular Formula 1 races early on, and since 1970 the legendary Eifel circuit has been the venue for one of the world's most popular endurance races. But also beyond the race weekends, the region around the \"Green Hell\" is a popular destination for motorsport fans and driving enthusiasts. ->","completion":" Munich. It is a marathon for people and engines. Once  a year, the top stars of touring car and Gran Turismo racing battle it  out for victory at the 24-hour race on the Nürburgring. The atmosphere  at the competition against and around the clock is reminiscent of the  times when Formula 1 races were still held on the Nürburgring's  Nordschleife. As a real spectator magnet - and at least from next year  onwards it will be again - the 24-hour race has already attracted up  to 200,000 spectators to the grandstands as well as to the meadows and  camping areas along the track in the Eifel. Motorsport fans and  driving enthusiasts, however, are captivated by the \"Ring\"  all year round. For them, the racing flair around the legendary  Nordschleife and the adjacent Grand Prix circuit opened in 1984 is  simply irresistible, as a 24-hour trip around the Nürburgring in the  MINI John Cooper Works Convertible (fuel consumption combined: 7.4 -  7.1 l\/100 km according to WLTP, 7.4 - 7.1 l\/100 km according to NEDC;  CO2 emissions combined: 167 - 161 g\/km according to WLTP, 169 - 163  g\/km according to NEDC) impressively proves.Hatzenbach, Fuchsröhre, Adenauer Forst, Caracciola-Karussell, Hohe  Acht, Döttinger Höhe: the names of the famous sections of the  Nürburgring have a mystical ring. During the so-called tourist drives,  hobby drivers can follow the tracks of the professionals and their  racing cars in their private vehicles. But to feel the fascination of  the Nürburgring, it is enough to be on the country roads in the  surrounding area. Over more than 20 kilometres, the Nordschleife winds  its way through the hilly and wooded landscape of the High Eifel. As a  result, the tradition-steeped race track passes several villages,  crosses public roads with bridges and subways, and can be seen from  outside by looking over the fence in many places.Three-time Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart once gave the  Nürburgring-Nordschleife the name \"Green Hell\". To this day,  it is considered the most demanding race track in the world. The BMW  Group's test and development engineers use the varied course to put  the finishing touches to the driving characteristics of new models. A  vehicle that passes the endurance test on the Nordschleife can  convince on any road in the world.A piece of the Nordschleife is also in the MINI John Cooper Works  Convertible. The developers call integrated application the  fine-tuning on test tracks, country roads and, not least, on the race  track that ensures that all drive and chassis systems work together  perfectly. In the case of the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible, the  test programme has resulted in the thrilling performance  characteristics of its 2.0-litre, 170 kW\/231 hp four-cylinder engine  with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology being transformed into extreme  driving pleasure. This is achieved with both the standard 6-speed  manual transmission and the optional 8-speed Steptronic Sport  transmission and with the model-specific sports suspension as well as  with the latest generation of the Adaptive Suspension, which now  features frequency-selective shock absorbers to ensure sporty handling  and long-distance ride comfort.The model-specific steering, the sports brake system with four-piston  fixed caliper brakes on the front wheels developed in cooperation with  the specialist manufacturer Brembo and the 17-inch John Cooper Works  light-alloy wheels are also fixed components of the standard overall  package for fascinating performance. Added to this are the design  features characteristic of John Cooper Works models, which ensure  optimum aerodynamic balance even in highly dynamic driving situations.  In the latest new edition of the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible,  the detailed work done to optimise airflow is visible at first glance.  Vertical air intakes in the front apron, which now has a particularly  clear and purist design, direct the airflow specifically along the  wheels to reduce turbulence. At the rear of the underbody, the airflow  now meets a particularly distinctive diffuser in the rear apron.On the country roads of the Eifel, the result of the precise  fine-tuning can be felt over every kilometre. They, too, offer the  mixture of tight bends and long curves, ascents and descents that make  up the charm of the Nordschleife. In addition to untouched nature,  historical monuments also invite you to stop off. These include, of  course, Nürburg Castle, built in the 12th century, which helped give  the \"Ring\" its name and which today sits on a hill in the  middle of the Nordschleife. The most beautiful view of the ruins of  the castle is in the village of the same name not far from the access  road to the race track.The \"Ring\" itself is also omnipresent on a day trip through  the Eifel. Time and again, a section of the Nordschleife suddenly  catches your eye as you drive between villages, meadows and forests.  If you stop at the right place, you will immediately be within sight  of the ideal line and can, for example, use the lunch break to watch  tourist or professional test drives on the race track.The tourist infrastructure of the High Eifel also includes numerous  signposted cycling and hiking trails. In the very north-east of the  \"Ring Region\", not far from the Caracciola Carousel, the  former steep section of the Nordschleife can be explored on foot or on  two wheels. There, for example, all it takes is a short change from  the MINI John Cooper Works Convertible to the MINI Folding Bike from  the MINI Lifestyle Collection to realise that the section of track  that was closed down decades ago does not bear its name without good reason.Around the \"Ring\", there is a choice of different types of  accommodation at campsites and in holiday home settlements. They were  created primarily for visitors to the motor sport events, the annual  rock festival and numerous other events on the Nürburgring grounds.  But they are also the ideal destination for a relaxed end to a day  full of driving fun during a 24-hour excursion to the Nürburgring. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product  Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com Fuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption were    measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC)    2007\/715 as amended.

{"prompt":" Amazon Alexa available in four more countries  BMW Maps now also has the traditional search mask  ->","completion":" Munich. Today marks the start of the rollout of the  new BMW Remote Software Upgrade for 1.3 million vehicles with BMW  Operating System 7. This activates Amazon Alexa integration in four  more markets. The upgrade also includes improvements, such as the  integration of the traditional destination entry in BMW Maps. Amazon Alexa integration for four more countries.The upcoming BMW Remote Software Upgrade will update the BMW    Operating System 7 to Version 21-03. The  rollout in Germany will start on June 1st 2021, gradually covering  more BMW Connected Drive markets worldwide. In total, more than 1.3  million BMW vehicles (and more than 20 models) will be given the upgrade.Customers can now also use many of the Alexa  features in their car they know and love at home: add items  to shopping lists, check the news, play music or control compatible  smart home devices from the car. So far, Alexa has been available for  BMW Operating System 7 vehicles in Germany, Austria, Great Britain,  Spain and Italy. This upgrade adds four more countries to the list -  France, the USA, Canada and Brazil. BMW Maps developers also bring back traditional search mask. The BMW Maps navigation system was rolled out in mid 2020 for  vehicles with BMW Operating System 7. The system, cloud-based for the  first time, makes route calculation significantly faster and more  dynamic by combining real-time information with predictive models. The  cloud also contains additional context-related information on now over  120 million points of interest, such as ratings, opening hours and  images. The POI database is updated and kept up-to-date several times  a week at short and regular intervals.The easiest way to enter the destination is in natural language in  dialogue with the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. With BMW Maps,  additional improvements in terms of ease of use via touch or BMW  controller have been implemented. The One-Box Search was used for the  first time, for example. This allows customers to search for the  addresses and names of places, as they are used to with when entering  text in web search engines. Algorithms are used to filter the  applicable database to display the probable suggestions already during  input (auto-completion).Many BMW customers also want the familiar screen mask for destination  entry (country, place, street, house number) back. BMW always has the  aim of offering its customers the best possible customer experience.  According to a decision by product management and the developers, the  traditional search was redeveloped in BMW Maps and is now available to  customers in addition to the one-box search.The adaptation for BMW Maps is activated after installing the current  BMW Remote Software Upgrade. Further improvements of functionsOne of the improvements provided by this upgrade is that the    Lane Departure Warningsettings can now be saved  permanently. If customers do not wish to benefit from the  lane departure warning, they can disable the function in the settings.  From now on, the deactivation remains stored in the corresponding,  activated BMW ID. The function is only reactivated if the customer  makes the corresponding change in the settings.Another improvement that comes with this update of the BMW Operating  System corrects a display error when playing media with    Android smartphones paired via Bluetooth (with  Android 11). After the upgrade, the cover art is  processed correctly when music tracks are changed.In some vehicle models with BMW Operating System 7 the    Surround View on the control display was not  positioned correctly. This has also been corrected as part of the  quality improvements. General notes on the BMW Remote Software Upgrade and on the rollout.With BMW Operating System 7 and BMW Remote Software Upgrade, it has  been possible since 2018 for BMW drivers to keep their vehicle  up-to-date with the latest software easily and quickly. The new  functions can be conveniently installed in the car over the air. The  installation files are prepared in the vehicle in the background.  After that, even the installation of extensive upgrades will rarely  take more than 20 minutes.Due to the Corona situation - with its impact on support capacities -  the rollout of the current upgrade may be delayed in individual markets.Vehicles with BMW Operating System 7 not produced before March 2021  already have the latest software version.Customers are informed about available Remote Software Upgrade via  the My BMW App or on the control display in the vehicle. In addition,  the software status can be viewed in the vehicle settings under Remote  Software Upgrade and a search for available upgrades can be carried  out. Remote Software Upgrade is now available for more than 20 BMW  models and thus almost for the entire BMW fleet.

BMW Motorrad Motorsport rounded off the second race    weekend in the 2021 FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK) in    Estoril (POR) with a solid Sunday: three BMW M 1000 RRs were among    the top nine to cross the line in the second main race. Michael van    der Mark (NED) from the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team rode his way up    from 14th on the grid to finish sixth on his BMW M 1000 RR. His    team-mate, Tom Sykes (GBR), finished eighth. Eugene Laverty (IRL),    competing for the BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse, wrapped up a    strong Sunday in ninth place. Jonas Folger (GER) from the BMW    satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing retired early from the second race    due to a technical problem. Sykes was the best BMW rider in the morning’s Superpole Race,  claiming seventh place. Starting from 13th on the grid, Laverty leapt  forward from the start and crossed the line in eighth after ten laps.  Van der Mark ended the Superpole Race in 13th, while Folger claimed 18th. In the second race, that featured incidents and falls in the leading  group, the BMW riders produced a consistent and error-free  performance. As had been the case in Saturday’s first race, van der  Mark put on another impressive chasing performance. He started from  14th after the Superpole Race and had already reached the top ten on  the second lap. It did not take long for van der Mark to move up to  seventh place and he was able to secure sixth spot on lap 15 of 21.  Sykes initially fell back from seventh on the grid, but was able to  move up again in the second half of the race. He crossed the finishing  line in eighth. Laverty made another great start from eighth on the grid, moving up  to fifth. Laverty held third place for a short time after Garrett  Gerloff (USA) and Michael Ruben Rinaldi (ITA) retired due to a  collision. He slipped back as the race continued, but finished ninth  to secure his second top ten result of the day. Folger, however, was  forced to end his race on lap three due to a technical problem. The third round of the WorldSBK 2021 will take place from 11th to  13th June in Misano, Italy.  Reactions after race two at Estoril. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director:  “Three riders in the top nine – finishing off the race  weekend with this result is certainly something to be pleased about.  It was not an easy weekend. Michael produced a very solid second race  after he was unfortunately unable to improve at all in this morning’s  Superpole Race. Of course, three other riders did take a tumble, but  also under these circumstances it’s all about getting a solid result.  He put on a great chasing performance and it was good to see that all  the BMWs are pretty close to one another. It was a shame that Jonas  had to retire. In general, he had a tough weekend. There are still a  few things to work on, specifically about finding the drive out of the  corners with little grip in these conditions. But I still think that  we did really well. We are satisfied, but now we have to take the next  step towards the podium. And I am confident we can achieve that over  the next three race weekends in Misano, Donington and Assen. On behalf  of the whole of the BMW Motorrad Motorsport family I would like to  express my sadness at the death of Jason Dupasquier and send his  family and friends our coldolences. This sad news has overshadowed the  race today.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning’s warm-up was really good: at least I felt good  – I was consistent. Also for the Superpole Race I felt really good,  but in warm-up we had changed the bike a little bit. That was good,  but as soon as the temperatures went up I struggled a little bit. So  the Superpole Race was not that ideal and we even lost two places on  the grid. But anyway, in race two the temperatures were much higher  than yesterday so we gambled to go for the ‘SC X’ tyre, which was the  right choice. The start was a bit messy – I had a good start but in  all three races I was a bit unlucky and could not improve my position  in the first corner. But at the end I was able to go at quite a  consistent pace. I had the chance to follow many riders and I think  our bike has made a huge improvement, especially over a race distance  and when it comes to conserving the tyre. We just need to find a  little bit more drive out of the corners and that should be our next  big step to improve on the bike.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “The bike was  much better today than yesterday. We made a small change and really  felt a big improvement on the bike. And again, just struggling, such a  shame when fighting for track position. For whatever reason, at the  moment we lose track positions to some other riders. The BMW M 1000 RR  is certainly strong in some sectors of the track and we are just  getting an understanding why. Unfortunately, I got stuck behind some  other riders and that gave us an issue today with the braking system.  Once I got a clear track, I picked up a lot more speed and found a  much better rhythm. Obviously I am not happy with the result but,  considering where we were yesterday, it’s a big, big improvement. We  definitely learnt a lot on this Sunday afternoon in Estoril and now we  need to keep improving.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “It has been a  bitter-sweet day, because my speed is there and, honestly, this year  the BMW M 1000 RR is such a huge step forward. The Aragón race weekend  was my first proper ride on this new bike, so I am still understanding  how to get the most from it. This weekend, wow, the bike was  fantastic, and in the final race I felt so good to fight with these  guys in the first laps and to get up into third position. But in this  heat I had to take care of the brakes, so I had to let the other  riders’ go and ride in clear air to cool the brakes. Now we will be  100 per cent ready in Misano. These first two rounds have more been  like a test, and from Misano on we will start the season properly.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Unfortunately, also  today did not go as we had hoped. We had a difficult weekend. That  said, things did look a bit better in the final race, even if it did  only last for two laps. But we would have made it into the points if  everything had gone right. Unfortunately, we had a technical problem.  Now we have to look ahead, use the short break and then go back on the  attack in Misano.” \n"}

The second round of the 2021 FIM Superbike World    Championship (WorldSBK) season is taking place in Estoril, Portugal.    It was a Saturday of highs and lows for BMW Motorrad Motorsport. In    race one, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team’s Michael van der Mark    (NED) worked his way up to seventh place with his BMW M 1000 RR. His    team-mate Tom Sykes (GBR) secured 14th position. Jonas Folger (GER)    from BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing crossed the line in 16th    place. Eugene Laverty (IRL) from BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse    finished 18th, scant reward for the convincing performance he    produced in qualifying and during the race. In the morning, Sykes claimed fifth place on the grid in Superpole  qualification. Folger was the second-best BMW rider in 11th place,  followed by van der Mark in 12th. Laverty had finished the session in  eighth place, but was one of many riders whose lap times were annulled  due to yellow-flags. Consequently, the Irishman slipped back to 13th  on the grid. In the race, van der Mark showed a consistent performance and was  able to make gradual progress after starting from 12th. He reached  seventh position by the halfway point of the race and was able to  maintain this until the chequered flag. Team-mate Sykes was in sixth  position right after the start of the race, but the British rider  started to fall back after the second lap. After 21 laps, he crossed  the finishing line in 14th place. Laverty went off like a rocket from 13th on the grid, moving up to  ninth through the first turns. He managed to hold on to seventh place  between laps four and nine, before suffering a fall that put paid to  his hopes of securing a top result. Laverty did return to the track  but had to settle for 18th. Folger lost some places at the start and  was unable to make any progress thereafter, crossing the line in 16th. Reactions after race one at Estoril. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “That  was a mixed day for us, but nonetheless I am very pleased with  Michael’s seventh place. Estoril is always a tricky circuit for us and  we had some lost track time to make up for. It was pretty difficult to  choose between the ‘X’ and ‘SC0’ tyres today. We took the safe option  with both riders. Ultimately, that proved to be the right choice and  we produced a solid race. However, seventh place is, of course, not  what we are aiming for. Tom fell back a very long way. Now we have to  analyse the reasons for this. He lost three or four seconds during the  opening laps. Of course, it is very disappointing to finish 14th, 36  seconds behind the winner. That is definitely not our objective. I was  delighted for Eugene at the start of the race, but unfortunately he  took a tumble when in seventh place. However, the track was relatively  greasy and we saw a few incidents like this. For Jonas, it just was  not his day and he would otherwise have recorded a better result. In  conclusion: It is good to have recorded a solid race and we can build  on this for tomorrow.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We  lost some valuable track time again this morning, so that was not how  we wanted to start the day. But anyway, in Superpole I felt good; I  improved my lap time and then in qualifying I had really good first  three sectors, but then the tyre was gone so I could not gain any time  in the last sector. That was a pity because that meant starting  initially from P14, which was then P12. I had a really good start and  the race was my first long run this weekend. I was surprised by the  pace I had and with the consistency of the bike. I am happy with this  position, but I am happier with the consistency we had and also when I  changed some electronics during the race. We took a really good step  forward. I am happy with P7 but even more about the whole pace.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It was a very  strange race. I am disappointed. We got a good start and I just tried  to go with the guys in front, but every time I opened the gas I lost  rear traction. And after a few laps I was losing the rear on corner  entry. After making a good start and mixing it in T1 I thought I would  get my best rhythm of the weekend, but it wasn’t to be. We clearly  need to work on these issues tonight and see what we can do but, yes,  it was a very strange race from my side. It was not what we have been  expecting and I’m quite disappointed.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “Unfortunately,  today did not go as I had imagined. It was a difficult race. I  struggled to get out of the corners; I had problems with grip. I gave  it my all, but I was just too slow. It’s a shame, as I was on the pace  in practice yesterday, but we could not reproduce that during today’s  race. Now we have to take a look at what caused that.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “All weekend has  been fantastic. The feeling of the bike is so good and we had a good  feeling in every practice and in qualifying. The reality was that I  was eighth fastest but then there was this penalty. In the race, I was  very happy with my first laps. I gained positions, I was doing really  fast lap times, 1:37.8, 1:37.9 and I was really consistent. Then in  corner four, I just asked a little bit too much of the front and  crashed. It was my mistake, but I am feeling really good with this  bike on a track where last year we were not so strong. So I am  optimistic for tomorrow.” \n"}

From a BMW M Motorsport perspective, the    49th staging of the Nürburgring 24 Hours (GER) on    5th\/6th June 2021 will be full of highlights,    both on and off the track. After the victory for ROWE Racing last    year, the focus from a sporting point of view is on the mission to    defend the title. Four BMW M Motorsport teams line up in the “Green    Hell” with seven BMW M6 GT3 and a host of top-class BMW works    drivers. They include the BMW Junior Team, which will be making its    24-hour debut in the GT3 class. BMW M CEO Markus Flasch will    experience the challenge posed by the Nordschleife for himself at    the wheel of the BMW M2 CS Racing. In the run-up to the race, the    focus is on the launch of the new BMW M4 GT3 and a very special lap    of honour. On the Wednesday before the 24-hour race, BMW M Motorsport will  unveil the BMW M4 GT3 in the livery, in which it will contest its  first test races over the rest of the year. The car will replace the  BMW M6 GT3 as the top car in the BMW M Motorsport range from 2022. On Friday, ahead of Top Qualifying, a replica of the legendary BMW M3  “Eifelblitz” from 1996, built up by BMW M Motorsport, will do an  honorary lap of the Nordschleife in memory of Sabine Schmitz, who  passed away recently. It will be driven by Johannes Scheid, who won  the 24-hour race alongside Schmitz in 1996 and 1997. In the BMW M2 CS Racing, Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH, will don  his racing helmet and start in the CUP5 class alongside Jörg  Weidinger, Matthias Malmedie and Niki Schelle (all GER). After  intensive preparations within the Nürburgring Endurance Series and the  6-hour qualification race, Flasch will be making his debut in the  endurance classic. In total, roughly 30 BMW cars are registered for  the 24-hour race in eight different classes. Leading the way are the seven BMW M6 GT3 in the top SP9 class, which  will be going all out to defend the title and claim the  21st overall victory for BMW. ROWE Racing fields two cars  and, as last year’s winners, will sport the prestigious number 1 on  one of their cars. The BMW Junior Team, with support from BMW works  driver Augusto Farfus (BRA), will be making its 24-hour debut in the  top class in a BMW M6 GT3 run by BMW Team RMG. Schubert Motorsport  lines up with one BMW M6 GT3, while Walkenhorst Motorsport takes to  the grid with three BMW M6 GT3. Quotes ahead of the Nürburgring 24 Hours: Markus Flasch (CEO of BMW M GmbH): “What a fantastic  week we have ahead of us! BMW M Motorsport has a programme littered  with highlights, both on and off the racetrack, underlining, as ever,  how important motorsport is to the BMW brand. With an impressive  contingent here at the Nürburgring, BMW M Motorsport is showing that  it is alive and kicking in the present. That will remain the case in  the future. A symbol of that future is the official presentation of  our new GT icon, the BMW M4 GT3, which will conquer the racetracks of  this world from 2022. From a sporting perspective, we are very much  looking forward to challenging for overall victory with the BMW M6 GT3  in its farewell season, and hopefully to defending the title that ROWE  Racing won in 2020. A particular focus will be on the debut of the BMW  Junior Team in the GT3 category. Our new entry-level car, the BMW M2  CS Racing will line up in the CUP5 class at the endurance classic for  the first time, and I am looking forward to having the opportunity  myself to take part in the race alongside my fantastic team-mates.  Johannes Scheid’s lap of honour in the BMW M3 ‘Eifelblitz’, built up  by BMW M Motorsport, in memory of Sabine Schmitz, is sure to be very  emotional. We are honoured to be able to pay tribute to her with this  legendary car.” Hans-Peter Naundorf (Team Principal ROWE Racing): “We  are very proud to come into the race as defending champion. Lining up  with the number 1 on the car is very special. The memories of our  victory in 2020 are still very fresh. We obviously have ambitions of  being out in front again this year, although we know that this is an  ambitious goal. However, we are a very well-rehearsed team with an  enormous amount of team spirit and we will take our opportunity,  should it come our way. I am particularly pleased that we will have  fans back at the circuit this year for this remarkable race.” Stefan Reinhold (Team Principal BMW Team RMG): “This  is a very special race for me personally and my team. During our time  in the DTM, we always tried to get involved in the 24-hour race.  Unfortunately, however, it never worked out. Now the wait is finally  over, and we are all really excited about our home race. Our approach  in the collaboration with the BMW Junior Team has always been to be  just as professional as in the DTM. As such, we had high expectations  of the boys, but they totally lived up to them. Their lap times are  all very good. It was important for us to see that, and gives us  another boost ahead of the race. With his experience and speed,  Augusto is extremely important to the whole team. He is one of the  fastest drivers on the Nordschleife, and knows the processes and the  BMW M6 GT3 extremely well. As such, he is not only a great help to the  Juniors, but to everyone in the team.” Torsten Schubert (Team Principal Schubert  Motorsport): “It is nice to be back at the 24-hour race with  the BMW M6 GT3 after two years away. Unfortunately, we have not had  the good fortune you need to convert our speed into top results in our  previous outings. As such, we are really hoping we can bid farewell to  the BMW M6 GT3 with a good result this time. We have drivers who know  the Nordschleife very well and we have already worked together with  the majority of them on numerous occasions. After finishing on the  podium at the recent season-opener in the ADAC GT Masters in  Oschersleben, we arrive at the Nürburgring full of motivation and optimism.” Niclas Königbauer (Team Manager Walkenhorst  Motorsport): “We are delighted to be fielding four cars in  this year’s 24-hour race. We are very happy with the drivers in our  three BMW M6 GT3 and are confident that we can really make a mark on  the race with them. We are also represented with a BMW M4 GT4. We hope  the weather gods are kinder to us than they were last year. If so, we  will certainly have a very exciting race ahead of us.” The key driver line-ups at a glance. ROWE Racing, #1 BMW M6 GT3:Nick Catsburg (NED)John Edwards (USA)Philipp Eng (AUT)Nick Yelloly (GBR) ROWE Racing, #98 BMW M6 GT3:Connor De Phillippi (USA)Martin Tomczyk (GER)Sheldon van der Linde (RSA)Marco Wittmann (GER) Schubert Motorsport, #20 BMW M6 GT3:Jesse Krohn (FIN)Jens Klingmann (GER)Alexander Sims (GBR)Stef Dusseldorp (NED) BMW Junior Team, #77 BMW M6 GT3:Dan Harper (GBR)Max Hesse (GER)Neil Verhagen (USA)Augusto Farfus (BRA) Walkenhorst Motorsport, #100 BMW M6 GT3:Henry Walkenhorst (GER)Friedrich von Bohlen (GER)Jörg Breuer (GER)Andreas Ziegler (GER) Walkenhorst Motorsport, #101 BMW M6 GT3:Christian Krognes (NOR)David Pittard (GBR)Ben Tuck (GBR)Jörg Müller (GER) Walkenhorst Motorsport, #102 BMW M6 GT3:Mario von Bohlen (GER)Sami-Matti Trogen (FIN)Jörg Müller (GER)Jakub Giermaziak (POL) Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive, #241 BMW M2 CS Racing:Markus Flasch (AUT)Matthias Malmedie (GER)Jörg Weidinger (GER)Niki Schelle (GER) \n"}

As such,  it contributes to the dissemination of knowledge and the arts. In  France, BMW Group France has been a patron of photography since 2003.\"The Pigment Change\" project created during the BMW  Residency.\"The Pigment Change\" takes an  experimental and scientific approach towards natural photo production,  whereby Romero's research focuses on pigment changes, with an  ecological and societal commitment. Her work echoes BMW Group's vision  of innovation for a more sustainable future and of production which  respects the environment and its resources.François Cheval, Artistic Director of the BMW Residency, commented on  the winner's work: \"Almudena Romero, like many of her peers,    believes that renewing the medium can follow the same path as the    first photographic processes, while highlighting the plastic and    physical characteristics of plants. Because plants are not only the    subject, they also take on a new status as vectors of visual    information. They are given the new role of determining the final    form of the work of art and specifying its meaning.\"Given the inevitable disappearance of the silver process, the  photographer seeks a virtuous practice using living materials. Her  main medium is natural, at the expense of chemistry, plants and her  material, as well as light specific to plants and photosynthesis.The project is divided into four parts: Faire une photographie (take  a photo), Family album, Offspring and The act of producing, which  represent the artist's viewpoint on production or the cause of existence.In \"Faire une photographie\", the plants  are exposed to specific amounts of light to bring about a pigment  change in the leaves, in spring and in fall.In \"Family album\", Almudena exposes the  negatives of her family archives directly onto cress cultivation  panels to \"grow\" photographic prints.In \"The act of producing\" and  \"Offspring\", the photographer uses entire  plants as photographic substrates on which she records her images.\"The act of producing\" features various  large-scale collages (1.5 x 2 m) made up of several leaves exposed to  extraordinary quantities of UV light to bring about a pigment change.  This pigment change, based on plants' survival mechanism, involves  replacing the chlorophyll pigments (green) with carotenoids (yellow)  to release excess energy. The artist uses the plants' ability to  change pigments to record very detailed images of her own hands while  working with the plants.In \"Offspring\", the artist uses plants'  selective reproduction strategies as a metaphor to express her  decision not to become a mother due to the current climate and  environment crisis. This part of the project includes a 30-day  timelapse documenting the birth of a new leaf and a series of text  elements printed directly onto the leaves of this plant.The artist was able to broaden her research thanks to the resources  available at the BMW Residency at the GOBELINS School of Visual Arts.  As such, she experimented with complex, fragile, expensive and  large-size materials within the school environment, assisted by two  students and supported by professors. EXHIBITIONS.\"The Pigment Change\"  created as part of the BMW Residency will be exhibited:BOOK.\"The Pigment Change\" has been  jointly published by BMW Art & Culture and Les éditions de l'air,  des livres.This original editorial choice supports the research and  experimentation dimension of the BMW Residency at the GOBELINS School  of Visual Arts.This edition is made up of three different-sized bound booklets,  inserted into a horizontal strip.

{"prompt":" BMW Group Plant Leipzig hosts Central German Hydrogen Summit  Fourth hydrogen fuel station opens at Plant Leipzig  Envisioning a green plant with fully decarbonised production  ->","completion":" Leipzig. The BMW Group has clear goals for effective  climate protection and sustainable mobility up to the year 2030 – and  products and production are affected.“Our solution to the challenges of environmental policy is  technological innovation. Technology is where the key to the future  lies – and it’s our constructive response for climate protection,”  said Hans-Peter Kemser, Director of BMW Group Plant Leipzig. As a  green plant, Leipzig aims not only to be carbon-neutral but also to  operate carbon-free production. “Our vision is to fully decarbonise  production by replacing fossil fuels with future fuels in the shape of  green hydrogen,” he added.And that’s why Hans-Peter Kemser was all the more delighted to host  the Central German Hydrogen Summit, which took place at BMW Group  Plant Leipzig today. In attendance were Michael Kretschmer, Minister  President of the Free State of Saxony, Dr. Reiner Haseloff, Minister  President of the state of Sachsen-Anhalt, Henry Graichen, County  Commissioner of the Leipzig District, Kai Emanuel, County Commissioner  of Nordsachsen, Burkhard Jung, Lord Mayor of Leipzig, and Egbert  Geier, Mayor of Halle, along with numerous guests from business,  politics, administration and academia taking part in discussions at  the plant. The event was streamed live, with speakers exploring  application and investment plans as well as the establishment by 2030  of a full-coverage hydrogen infrastructure for the Halle and Leipzig region.In his welcome speech, Hans-Peter Kemser listed the three main  challenges of using green hydrogen: how to ensure sufficient supplies  for the plant, which technologies exist or need developing to enable  the use of hydrogen, and how to remain profitable despite the current  high cost of green hydrogen. All three points are currently being  investigated and assessed with partners from politics and business.In a first step, hydrogen is already being used in logistics to power  tractors and forklifts carrying required parts to the assembly  lines. The first such vehicles went into service back in 2013, and  Plant Leipzig now operates 81 in total. With a further 37 to be added  shortly, Plant Leipzig will have the largest hydrogen-powered  logistics fleet in Germany. Like conventionally powered vehicles, the  hydrogen fleet has the great advantage of being very quick to refuel –  and the filling stations take up little space.The Hydrogen Summit also provided the backdrop for BMW Group Plant  Leipzig to inaugurate its fourth on-site hydrogen filling station. The  first went on stream in 2013 in the BMW i bodyshop and was the only  indoor H2 refuelling station in Germany at the time. Two  more followed in 2018, and a fourth is now also set to supply the  steadily rising number of hydrogen vehicles. About 50 kg of hydrogen  are put into their tanks every day – all of it certified green since  day one.BMW Group Plant Leipzig has always been planned as a “green plant”  and has set standards in sustainability in many areas, from production  of the electric BMW i3 and BMW i8 to the site’s four wind turbines and  battery farm, and the hydrogen-powered vehicles operating in  intralogistics. A holistic approach to advancing sustainability has  been the goal throughout.\n"}

{"prompt":"In our monthly BMW SIM News, we briefly summarise news from the world of virtual racing, and provide information on driver backgrounds, teams, technology, and much more.  ->","completion":" BMW SIM GT Cup.The inaugural season of the BMW  SIM GT Cup at the virtual Nürburgring Grand Prix Circuit on the  iRacing platform concluded with a thrilling finale and a one-two for  the Coanda Simsport team. The participants in the final race had  qualified for round five in the first four events of the season and  then had another opportunity to secure one of the sought-after tickets  for the grand finale at the end of the season. As had been the story  throughout the entire season, the final race was characterised by a  thrilling battle between Team Redline and Coanda Simsport, with the  latter once again coming out on top with a one-two. After two hours of  racing, Dayne Warren (AUS) and Mack Bakkum (NED) crossed the finish  line first in their BMW M8 GTE to qualify for the grand finale at the  end of the year. They will be joined there by runners-up David  Williams (GBR) and Paschalis Gkergkis (GRE).At the end of the first season of the BMW SIM GT Cup, twelve  drivers have now been confirmed for the season finale. Team Redline is  represented by four drivers, in the form of Jonas Wallmeier (GER) and  Gianni Vecchio (GER), and Enzo Bonito (ITA) and Maximilian Benecke  (GER), who won the first two races. Defending champion Joshua Rogers  (AUS), Mitchell deJong (USA), Jeremy Bouteloup (FRA) and Charlie  Collins (GBR), who all line up for Coanda Simsport, complete the  starting field so far. The remaining competitors will be determined in  season two of the BMW SIM GT Cup, in which the new BMW M4 GT3 will be  used instead of the BMW M8 GTE.BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup.Marcell Csincsik (HUN) won the final two races of this season’s  BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup on the rFactor2 platform. These represented  win numbers three and four for the Varga Simracing Team driver in the  inaugural season of the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup, in which six drivers  qualified for the grand finale at the end of the year. As well as  Csincsik, Jiri Toman (CZE) and defending champion Erhan Jajovski (MKD)  have also secured their tickets for the season finale at the end of  the year, courtesy of victories in races three and four of the season.  Michal Smidl (CZE), Risto Kappet (EST) and Philipp Drayss (GER) have  also qualified. The remaining six sim racers will be determined in  season two of the BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup 2021.IMSA iRacing Pro Series.Philipp Eng (AUT) is the new champion in the IMSA iRacing Pro  Series. Third place in the final race at the virtual Road Atlanta  circuit was enough for the BMW works driver to secure the title in the  GTE class. “Winning the title in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series means an  awful lot to me,” said Eng. “I have invested a lot of work and time,  trained a lot, and done an awful lot of set-up work together with BMW  Team BS+COMPETITION. The collaboration was really perfect. For this  reason, I am very happy with this title win.” The race win went to  Agustín Canapino (ARG), who was followed over the finish line by  Rodrigo Pflucker (PER) in second place. As such, the BMW M8 GTE  claimed its third victory in three races. Eng had previously won the  first two races, which were held on the Sebring and Laguna Seca  circuits, to lay the foundation for his title win in the IMSA iRacing  Pro Series, which was held for the second time. In last year’s  inaugural season, Bruno Spengler (CAN) won the title – again in the  BMW M8 GTE. As well as Spengler, the field in season two again  included some big-name drivers – Connor De Phillippi (USA), Augusto  Farfus (BRA), John Edwards (USA) and Robby Foley (USA) – who also  compete in BMW cars in the real IMSA Series.SimGrid Sprint Cup.Title win for BMW Team G2 Esports in the SimGrid Sprint Cup.  Second place at the final round of the championship, which is held on  the Assetto Corsa Competizione platform, was sufficient for drivers  Nils Naujoks, Arthur Kammerer and Gregor Schill (all GER) to wrap up  the title on the virtual Suzuka circuit. Over the course of the  season, the trio in the virtual BMW M6 GT3 had won two races and  claimed a second place. “We honestly did not expect to win the title,  so we are overjoyed that we did. We proved that the BMW M6 GT3 is  capable of winning in the right hands and with a strong team behind  it,” said Naujoks. “At the start of the season, we did not know what  to expect. Gregor has only just joined the team and we were actually  expecting to start as underdogs. Plus, we were also unsure of how the  success ballast system would play out.”V10 R-League.The BMW SIM Racing Team is the new champion in the V10 R-League.  In the Grand Final, Kevin Siggy, Alen Terzic (both SLO) and Michael  Romanidis (GRE) defeated the Aston Martin Cognizant Esports Team 2:1  to win the title for the first time at the second attempt. “We led the  final 2:0, but it then got very close again. Fortunately, I was able  to secure pole position in the all-important final race and just bring  home the win. We have now won the title for BMW SIM Racing – that is  awesome,” said Siggy, who was crowned ‘Driver of the Season’ after the  final. As well as Siggy, Terzic and Romanidis, the BMW SIM Racing Team  also included Felix Quirmbach (GER). The virtual racing series, which is held on the Assetto Corsa  Competizione platform, sees three of the four team members go  head-to-head, taking on the opposition in three different race  formats. The car of choice is a Formula car, which has been developed  specially for this racing series. The rounds leading up to the finale  had already caused great excitement. Having trailed 0:2 in the  quarter-final, the BMW SIM Racing Team launched an impressive  fightback against the Yas Heat team to progress to the semi-final.  Siggy, Romanidis and Terzic then defeated defending champions Team  Redline 3:1 to earn their place in the Grand Final, in which they won  the title. “Our semi-final victory over Redline was actually the  biggest shock,” said Siggy. “Nobody expected that, and it was probably  the key moment on the road to the title.”\n"}

The new BMW M 1000 RR has demonstrated its potential    in the FIM Superbike World Championship. The BMW Motorrad WorldSBK    Team claimed its best team result so far at the opening round of the    2021 season at MotorLand Aragón (ESP). Tom Sykes (GBR) and Michael    van der Mark (NED) ended race two on Sunday afternoon in fourth and    fifth places, just one and a half seconds outside the podium    positions. Van der Mark had already impressed with a strong comeback    in the morning’s Superpole race. Jonas Folger (GER) from BMW    satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing finished eighth to round off a    successful Sunday. After enjoying warm and sunny conditions on Friday and Saturday,  Sunday started with rain. The circuit was damp in places at the start  of the Superpole race, but was also drying out in other places making  tyre selection rather tricky. Van der Mark opted for slick tyres, on  which he shot through from 15th on the grid to finish fifth at the end  of the ten-lap sprint race. The Dutchman also set the fastest lap of  the race on his BMW M 1000 RR. Sykes started from third place on the  wet-weather tyre, and was initially running in the top five. However,  he then fell back through the field and returned to the garage on lap  eight as his tenth place on the grid for race two was secure in any case. Conditions were similarly unsettled at the start of race two in the  afternoon. Van der Mark (fifth on the grid) and Sykes (tenth on the  grid) both opted for intermediate tyres. Van der Mark was battling  with the leading group from the word go, and actually briefly took the  lead on lap six. He then spent several laps defending second place  against Jonathan Rea (GBR \/ Kawasaki). With just a few laps remaining,  Rea and his team-mate Alex Lowes (GBR) managed to find their way past  him. Meanwhile, Sykes was consistently picking his way through the  field and ultimately found himself behind van der Mark. The two  swapped positions on lap 16 of 18, meaning Sykes finished fourth,  ahead of his team-mate in fifth. Folger ended the Superpole race in 13th place, having started 18th.  His big moment came in race two. He and the Bonovo MGM Racing team  opted for slicks. Folger initially had to restrain himself and dropped  down the field. However, he then launched an impressive comeback. On  the final lap, Folger had climbed into sixth place, behind the two  riders from the BMW works team. Shortly before the chequered flag, he  lost two positions due to a small mistake, meaning he crossed the  finish line in eighth place. Eugene Laverty, riding for BMW satellite  team RC Squadra Corse, was 16th in the Superpole race and ended race  two in 17th place. Reactions after race two at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  are very happy. We invested so much work in this project in the  winter, and it was very difficult at the tests to establish exactly  how we really compared to the others. We got off to a difficult start  this weekend, so it is great to be able to turn that around in this  way. Sure they were extraordinary conditions, but it was very pleasing  to see that we were able to challenge the Kawasakis, which are setting  the benchmark, for the full race. There were obviously times in the  race when we would have liked to have finished on the podium, but it  is excellent that we were able to demonstrate with two or even three  bikes that we have the potential to do that. It is a strong result, on  which we can build. We are super happy. The work has paid off, but we  will not stop here – we will continue to work hard.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “A great day. Yesterday it was a struggle in areas, so I was  happy with how we finished the race. Today, I was struggling to see if  we could improve on that, but this morning Michael went out in the  morning’s warm-up in the rain and was immediately fast considering  this was his first ever outing in the wet conditions on the BMW M 1000  RR. In the Superpole race, Michael had a really good run, so to see  him come away with fifth was pleasing as he is learning every day when  he gets on the bike. Tom had an issue with the rear tyre in the  Superpole race so we had to retire but nevertheless we started in P5  and P10 in race two. That race was really exciting, to be battling for  the lead and never out of the top-three, top-four places for most of  the race was great to see. Both BMWs were in the spotlight and it’s  testament to the whole of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team who have  brought this bike through. Heading into Estoril we can be confident we  can be threat for the rest of the season.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “A bittersweet  day, really. We definitely had a Superpole race to forget which we  won’t go into too much detail about. That meant that we compromised  our start position in race two. For race two, I wanted to go with the  slick tyre but after this morning we opted to play it safe on the  intermediates. Overall, after a good start, it was a bit of a waiting  game. I could see what the guys in front of me were doing but  obviously considering the tyres we were on I tried a different  strategy to feel where the BMW M 1000 RR was working and where we had  to improve. Unfortunately, we just missed out on the podium today, but  considering our results here last year it is a huge improvement.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “This morning, we had a wet warm-up session which was my  first time on the BMW M 1000 RR in the rain, and to be honest I had  such a good feeling from the first lap. The Superpole race was in  mixed conditions but I opted to go with the slick tyre and in the end  was the right choice. It did however keep raining at times during the  race which slowed me down in places but anyway it was a good result  for us. This afternoon’s race two again was a gamble on tyre choice,  and I knew I made the wrong choice going up to the start as the track  was drying so quickly. Despite that we made a good start, had some  incredible battles taking the lead but I knew I was asking too much of  the tyres and in the end some guys got past me. But we have got to be  happy with the two P5 positions and most importantly the experience  I’ve gained with the BMW M 1000 RR.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “We are absolutely  happy with eighth place in race two. It is class that we managed this  at the end of what was a difficult weekend. The conditions were very  difficult and we did not know for a long time whether wets or slicks  were the best option. We opted for slicks in the end. Only very few  others made the same decision, including the winner Scott Redding, and  we set the same lap time as Scott. The weather obviously suited us,  but we are very happy. Unfortunately, I went wide in the battle with  Toprak Razgatlioglu at the end of the race, otherwise we could perhaps  have finished sixth. However, eighth place was still the highlight  compared to the rest of the weekend, so we are very happy.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “It was not a good  day, unfortunately. We had some problems in all sessions. For the long  race, I had the wet front tyre and the other riders had intermediates  or slick tyres so there was no chance to move further forward. So it  was really disappointing but I am looking forward to Estoril already.  I said that Aragón and Estoril have been the toughest two tracks for  our bike last year so we have a big challenge but we did a good job  here yesterday during qualifying so that’s reason for optimism. In  Estoril, we need to put our progress on paper because this weekend we  weren’t able to get the results we wanted.” \n"}

Making its race debut in the FIM Superbike World    Championship (WorldSBK), the new BMW M 1000 RR claimed a top-six    result on the first attempt. Tom Sykes (GBR) from the BMW Motorrad    WorldSBK Team ended race one at MotorLand Aragón in sixth place,    only two seconds from a podium position. The Spanish circuit is    hosting the opening round of the 2021 WorldSBK season. His team-mate    Michael van der Mark (NED) came home eleventh in race one, after    enduring a difficult Saturday. In the first Superpole of the season on Saturday morning, Sykes  secured a starting place on the front row of the grid; the Englishman  finished third in qualifying. Van der Mark was 15th. In the morning’s  free practice, van der Mark could only do one timed lap as a CAN-Bus  failure occurred in the supplied tyre pressure monitoring system TMPS,  mandatory by FIM, that could not be identified immediately. Sykes lost a few positions in the first lap of the race. For long  stretches of the race, he was running eighth. However, he then climbed  into sixth in the closing stages, partly being the fastest rider of  the field. Van der Mark moved into eleventh place early on in the  race, and eventually crossed the finish line in the same position. Jonas Folger (GER) started the race from 18th place. After 20 laps of  racing, the rider from BMW satellite team Bonovo MGM Racing finished  16th, missing out on the points by just one position. Eugene Laverty  (IRL) from BMW satellite team RC Squadra Corse started from 12th and  was on course to score points but had to retire with five laps remaining. Reactions after race one at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “I am  very happy with our performance. In the end, Tom was just 2.5 seconds  off a place on the podium. It was an impressive race. After the issues  we had in yesterday’s warm conditions we did pretty well today. In  Michael’s case, it is just good that he now has a race under his belt.  After his crash yesterday and the technical issue this morning, he was  only able to complete multiple laps in qualifying. We must now take a  look – it was the first long run he has managed here, and I am sure it  will allow us to take another step forward. On the whole, my summary  would be: satisfied.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “From where we were in the free practices and in qualifying,  I had my personal predictions and I am really pleased that Michael and  Tom kind of got where I hoped that they would be. Michael was almost  in the top ten after the crash he had in yesterday’s practice and the  issue this morning, so it was good for him to get a race under his  belt. I think he will come back much stronger tomorrow from that. With  Tom I am really pleased; he did a superb job to get third in  Superpole. In the race, he went with the ‘X’ tyre which isn’t normally  his style, but we convinced him it was the way to go and he got  started and become strong when the other guys were battling, managing  to bridge the gap. He crossed the line just two seconds off the podium  and if you would have asked me before that weekend had started, I  would have taken that. So delighted for top-six for Tom, and Michael  will do big steps forward. Overall, we are happy.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We came here  and we still had some test items that we needed to do and honestly I  thing we got a good compromise because we have been trying things in  free practice and still got to try to work on a race set-up, so  overall I think it was not too bad. I still don’t have the package to  do want I want in the first quarter of the race. Then I could see that  towards the end of the race that we had quite a good pace, certainly  better than the guys in front. It is still early days and to be  honest, considering the limitations I felt I had, I think that P6 is  not bad. Now we have time to sit down and have a look and make some  changes for tomorrow. So overall, it was not a bad start.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “We  were really unlucky this morning. We lost a lot of time as we had that  problem with the bike. At the end, the guys fixed it and I could do  one lap in FP3 but still I need more laps after losing yesterday.  Superpole was not so bad but it was the first time with a qualifying  tyre for me and the bike changes a lot so you have to get used to it.  In the race, I had an okay start and the first few laps I was feeling  very strong but at one point of the track I was losing too much to  stay with the other guys. Just one particular sector. That was a bit  of a shame because then I tried to push more and stressed the front  tyre too much and started to lose time. But overall it was important  to finally do a long distance and we can learn a lot from this.  Tomorrow is a new day and with all the information we have now,  tomorrow should be better.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “It was a tough  race. We have to find some solutions, as I do not feel comfortable on  the bike. It is unfortunate, as we have tried out a lot of things. So  far, however, we have not yet found the right set-up. At the moment,  we are on a bit of a low. I did the best I could, but it was  a  disappointing race.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “Qualifying was  actually really good, even if a 12th position is not on the front  rows, but the bike felt very good. Unfortunately, in the race, we had  some small problems from the beginning and in the closing stages  something strange happened. The bike stopped and we are still  investigating the cause. But the potential of the bike this year is  much better. That’s the positive thing I can say. In qualifying the  bike was feeling much better than last year here at Aragón.” \n"}

Based on the progress of the proceedings, BMW  AG expects, compared with the statement of objections of 5 April 2019,  that the EU Commission will significantly reduce its allegations  against BMW AG in terms of content and duration. The subject matter of the proceedings is whether German automobile  manufacturers cooperated in technical working groups to restrict  competition in the development and rollout of emission-reduction  technologies. The legal conformity of diesel vehicles is not subject  of the proceedings. The BMW Group is not and has not been accused of  unlawful manipulation of emission control systems. On 5 April 2019, BMW AG had recognised a provision of around €1.4  billion. Based on the new information, BMW AG continues to consider it  more likely than not that the EU Commission will issue a fine to BMW  AG. However, the significant limitation in the scope of the  allegations has led to a revaluation of the provision. This  revaluation will result in a positive effect on earnings of around €1  billion in the second quarter of 2021. This effect on earnings is not included in the current guidance for  2021 and will lead to an increase in the EBIT margin for the  Automotive segment of around one percentage point. The current  corridor forecast in this respect will be increased accordingly.

{"prompt":" 22-inch tyres using certified sustainable natural rubber and rayon, a wood-based material used to strengthen the tyres  Plantations certified to standards of independent Forest Stewardship Council TM (FSC TM) organisation  Wendt: “We are helping preserve biodiversity and forests to counteract climate change”  ->","completion":" Munich. The BMW Group is stepping up its activities  in the field of sustainability, becoming the first automotive  manufacturer worldwide to equip its cars with tyres using certified  sustainable natural rubber and rayon, a wood-based material used to  strengthen the tyres. The company will source 22-inch tyres in the  first instance exclusively from Pirelli and, from August of this year,  will use them in the BMW X5 xDrive45e Plug-in-Hybrid (fuel    consumption combined: 1.7-1.2 l\/100km (WLTP), 2.1-1.6 l\/100 km    (NEDC); power consumption combined: 27.7-24.3 kWh\/100 km (WLTP),    25.2-23.5 kWh\/100 km (NEDC); CO2 emissions combined: 39-27 g\/km    (WLTP), 47-37 g\/km (NEDC)). Certification of the rubber  plantations and the complex supply chain for natural rubber and rayon  takes place in accordance with the strict standards of the independent  Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).“As a premium manufacturer, we aspire to lead the way in  sustainability and take responsibility,” said Dr Andreas Wendt, member  of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for Purchasing and  Supplier Network. “We have been committed to improving cultivation of  natural rubber and increasing transparency in the supplier network  since 2015. The use of tyres made of certified natural rubber is a  pioneering achievement for our industry. In this way, we are helping  preserve biodiversity and forests to counteract climate change.”Natural rubber is the basic material for many products we use in our  daily lives, such as boots and mattresses. About six million small  farmers worldwide are responsible for over 80% of the world’s natural  rubber cultivation. In the so-called rubber belt across the tropical  regions, they run farms of between one and two hectares in size under  a wide variety of different conditions. Agreeing uniform social and  environmental growing conditions with these millions of small  individual farms is therefore a major challenge.By far the largest share of natural rubber grown worldwide goes into  tyre production. Natural rubber’s high elasticity and sturdiness  currently make it irreplaceable for tyre production. Small label, big impactAs an independent organisation, FSC has developed an internationally  recognised and demanding certification standard in recent years that  is used worldwide for environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial  and economically viable management of the forests. The organisation,  whose well-known logo is already established in the wood and paper  industry, also applies this standard to products made of natural rubber.The new 22-inch P ZERO ∗ tyre has now become the world's first tyre  to receive the coveted FSC label. To earn this certification, Pirelli  adapted its US plant in Rome, Georgia, to produce tyres using  FSC-certified natural rubber and rayon. From there, the tyres are  delivered to BMW Group Plant Spartanburg, around 370 km away, and  mounted on the BMW X5 Plug-in Hybrid. The star ∗ in the name indicates  that the new tyre meets the BMW Group’s strict performance  requirements, including particularly low rolling resistance and noise level.Giovanni Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli’s Senior Vice President for  Sustainability and Future Mobility, said: “Before even reaching the  road, sustainable mobility begins with raw materials. With the world’s  first FSC-certified tyre, Pirelli once again demonstrates its  commitment to pursuing increasingly challenging goals in terms of  sustainability, a testament to the constant work on innovative  materials and increasingly cutting-edge production processes. We  continue to invest in sustainable growth for our planet, aware that  this is also essential for the future of our businesses.”Jeremy Harrison, Chief Markets Officer, FSC International, added:  “The new FSC-certified Pirelli Tyre is a significant milestone in the  drive to deliver economic, social, and environmental benefits across  the natural rubber value chain. This is a major step forward in the  journey towards a more sustainable natural rubber value chain, thereby  helping to mitigate deforestation and support the fight against  climate change.” Long-standing commitment to greater transparency and    sustainability in the natural rubber supplier networkThe use of the first tyres containing certified sustainable natural  rubber and rayon at the BMW Group is the result of the company’s  extensive commitment in this area. In 2019, the BMW Group joined  forces with well-known tyre manufacturers, NGOs, rubber producers and  consumers to create the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber  (GPSNR). Small farmers are also represented in this initiative. The  GPSNR is committed to improving social and environmental conditions  for cultivation of natural rubber and pushing for more sustainability.  It also implements measures to stop deforestation and make supply  chains more transparent. The GPSNR currently has almost 100 members,  who are responsible for about 50 percent of the global natural rubber market.Through its activities in the GPSNR and close cooperation with its  suppliers, the BMW Group is constantly working to further improve  sustainability in the natural rubber supply chain. The BMW Group is  stepping up these activities and plans to steadily expand its sourcing  of tyres made from sustainably grown natural rubber.The BMW Group has been working with the FSC organisation for many  years (Licence code FSC-N002012). The company decided to use  FSC-certified wood in the BMW i3, which was first launched onto the  market in 2013. The BMW iX for release later this year will also  feature FSC-certified wood. In 2017, the BMW Group and FSC advocated  for further development of FSC standards for cultivation of natural  rubber in Thailand. Sustainability an integral part of all purchasing activitiesIndependently of these measures, the BMW Group has contractually  obligated all its direct suppliers to respect human rights, comply  with expanded environmental and social standards and to introduce  management systems to promote occupational safety and protect the  environment since 2014. This also includes protecting forests and  biodiversity. These requirements must also be contractually passed on  to subcontractors. BMW Group Purchasing does not rely on contractual  obligations alone for this but is also implementing a large number of  additional measures in a transparent process. A risk filter is used to  evaluate potential supplier locations worldwide even before the call  for bids. The next step is to require possible suppliers to outline  their sustainability activities in a detailed questionnaire. External  partners also work with internal appraisers to review selected  locations. Throughout the contract period, external partners work with  internal appraisers to verify compliance with sustainability  requirements through questionnaires and audits. In this way, BMW Group  Purchasing is able to monitor thousands of locations every year. Sustainable mobility with the BMW X5 xDrive45eThe BMW Group has completed full lifecycle CO2  certification for the BMW X5 xDrive45e – from raw material  procurement, through the supply chain, production and use phase, all  the way to recycling. If charged during the use phase with the average  European electricity mix, this gives it an advantage of around 40  percent over the BMW X5 xDrive40i. If charged with green power, the  advantage is around 70 percent. The electric range amounts to 77-88  kilometres (WLTP).\n"}
{"prompt":"Locally emission-free driving fun, variably usable luggage compartments and carrier systems for roof tent mounting make it possible: with the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 and the MINI Cooper SE, the British premium brand offers two models at once for sustainable holiday fun in natural surroundings. ->","completion":" Munich. Holidays in the region and journeys of  discovery through the local countryside will continue to be high on  the list of priorities for many people seeking relaxation in the  summer of 2021. The desire to relax in nature also inspires a  preference for camping. These holiday trends are beneficial for the  eco-balance, especially when they are combined with sustainable  mobility. MINI has two models with electrified drive and matching  optional equipment on offer for all those who want to be both flexible  and particularly efficient on the road: the MINI Cooper SE Countryman  ALL4 (fuel consumption combined: 1.9 - 1.7 l\/100 km according to WLTP,  2.1 - 1.9 l\/100 km according to NEDC; electricity consumption  combined: 15.5 - 14.8 kWh\/100 km according to WLTP, 14.8 - 14.1  kWh\/100 km according to NEDC; CO2 emissions combined: 44 - 39 g\/km  according to WLTP, 48 - 44 g\/km according to NEDC) with plug-in hybrid  system and the purely electrically driven MINI Cooper SE (power  consumption combined: 17.6 - 15.2 kWh\/100 km according to WLTP, 16.1 -  14.9 kWh\/100 km according to NEDC) Equipped in each case with  model-specific carrier systems from the MINI Original Accessories  range and a roof tent, they form the greenest camper fleet in the world.With its hybrid-specific all-wheel drive and a system output of 162  kW\/220 hp, the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 is ideally equipped for  excursions into the countryside. With the ALL4 Trim or Classic Plus  Package, its equipment is supplemented by a roof rail, among other  things. A roof tent can be easily mounted on the roof rails with the  appropriate railing rack.The MINI Cooper SE can be equipped with mobile night quarters in the  same way. The purely electrically powered small car is the only model  in its competitive field that can also be equipped with roof rails.  The matching carrier system can be found in the MINI Original  Accessories range. And you're ready to go. The MINI Cooper SE carries  the roof tent swiftly across the country: thanks to the  aerodynamically optimised profile of its body, the roof tent does not  noticeably restrict the temperament of the 135 kW\/184 hp MINI Cooper  SE, which can sprint from standstill to 100 km\/h in 7.3 seconds. The  MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 is just as relaxed about the increase  in power. As a robust all-rounder, it also masters its role as a  touring vehicle with flying colours.On a joint camping trip, the two electrified models reveal their  qualities each in their own way. According to the WLTP test cycle, the  MINI Cooper SE has a range of 203 to 234 kilometres. The electric  range of the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 is up to 59 kilometres.  However, it can use the intelligently controlled interaction of the  combustion engine and electric motor to replenish the energy reserves  of its high-voltage battery on the road.On winding country roads, there is a lot of driving pleasure. The  battery, which is located low to the ground in both models, also  contributes to this, shifting the vehicle's centre of gravity  downwards and thus ensuring even more agility. The MINI Cooper SE  Countryman ALL4, together with the MINI Cooper SE, rolls onto the  camping site so quietly that even the crackling of twigs under the  tyres can be heard.The cautious approach signals respect for nature. Those who not only  hike or cycle there, but also spend the night afterwards, experience  it even more intensively - and can enjoy the view of the landscape  from their sleeping place in the roof tent. Discovering the world from  above - that's even possible from the roof of a MINI.The shelter can be erected at dizzy heights within a few seconds.  After releasing the safety catches on the housing, the tent structure  lifts up automatically with the help of gas springs. The eight rungs  of the fold-out aluminium ladder can be climbed just as quickly.  Inside, there are two comfortable sleeping berths. In summer heat, the  windows can be rolled up, and thanks to the mosquito nets in front of  them, no pests can get inside.Sleeping bags, luggage and provisions for longer camping trips for  two can be stored in the luggage compartment of the MINI Cooper SE,  which can be expanded from 211 to 731 litres after folding down the  rear seat backrest. This provides the same stowage volume as in the  conventionally powered model variants of the MINI 3-door. The MINI  Cooper SE Countryman ALL4, with its five doors, five fully-fledged  seats and a luggage compartment volume of 405 to 1 275 litres, is a  true all-rounder in the premium compact segment.There is therefore also enough space for all kinds of holiday  companions that add a touch of comfort to the simple life in the midst  of nature. A glance at the digital cockpit display of the MINI Cooper  SE and the MINI Cooper SE Countryman ALL4 reveals that there is no  lack of energy. The charge level of the high-voltage batteries is  still well within the green zone. If you have a cool box on board, you  can enjoy a chilled drink. The audio system plays subtle music. There  is also more than enough power to charge the smartphone. When a mobile  espresso machine is added, the threshold from camping to glamping is  finally crossed.And if the energy reserves do run low, this is no problem either.  Many campsites are now equipped with charging points. So nature lovers  can enjoy the beauty of the landscape on a hiking tour without  worrying, while their electrified MINI charges up fresh energy to  complete the onward journey to the next campsite or the drive home in  the most sustainable way possible.\n"}

This weekend, BMW Motorrad    Motorsport kicks off its campaign in the 2021 FIM Superbike World    Championship (WorldSBK). After the development period and winter    tests, the new BMW M 1000 RR is now set for its race debut. For the    first time, the 2021 WorldSBK grid will feature four riders on the    BMW M 1000 RR. Tom Sykes (GBR) and BMW newcomer Michael van der Mark    (NED) start for the works team, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team.    Jonas Folger (GER) and Eugene Laverty (IRL) line up for BMW    satellite teams Bonovo MGM Racing and RC Squadra Corse. After a break of over half a year, the season gets underway with a  double-header in Spain and Portugal. The first race weekend of the  year will take place from 21st to 23rd May at MotorLand Aragón (ESP).  This is followed just one week later (28th to 30th May) by round two  of the season at Estoril (POR). In preparation for the season, BMW  Motorrad Motorsport and the BMW teams were at MotorLand Aragón for a  pre-season test roughly two weeks ago. The new BMW M 1000 RR is a consistent development of the BMW S 1000  RR. At the heart of the new M RR is the engine. Like the engine for  the production model, it has been developed specifically for racing.  The chassis geometry and aerodynamics have also been improved. In a  two-part video documentary, BMW Motorrad Motorsport shows the route  from assembly to the racetrack, from the production of the engines at  the BMW Motorrad plant in Berlin (GER), and the assembly of the race  bikes at the headquarters of the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team in  Guisborough (GBR), to the works and satellite teams’ outings on the  track at MotorLand Aragón. The videos are available for download and  further use here in the BMW Group PressClub and can also be viewed on  the BMW Motorrad YouTube channel: b.mw\/Launch_2021_Part_1  and b.mw\/Launch_2021_Part_2.  Quotes ahead of the opening round of the 2021 WorldSBK season. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “We  go into the 2021 WorldSBK season with a lot of new features. For  example, we are obviously looking forward to the race debut of our BMW  M 1000 RR. The tests went very well and, although we still have a bit  of work ahead of us with the new bike, I am feeling very positive. I  would like to say another big thank you to everyone who has been so  full of enthusiasm for their role in the development, assembly and  preparation of the M RR: our production colleagues and engineers in  Munich, engine production in Berlin, the team members and, of course,  our riders. Another important step for our WorldSBK project is the  fact that we are now more broadly positioned than before. As well as  our established works team, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, our family  now also includes the satellite teams Bonovo MGM Racing and RC Squadra  Corse. When it comes to the riders, we are also very strongly  positioned, with Tom Sykes, Michael van der Mark, Eugene Laverty and  Jonas Folger. Our goal for the season is to close the gap to the  front-runners and claim our first win.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “We are looking forward to finally get into the race weekend.  It has been a long off-season between Estoril and this first round. I  think we have really taken good steps forward with the BMW M 1000 RR  and I am looking forward to see what we can do in race conditions. The  weather is looking very favourable for Aragón and obviously we go over  there where we last tested so we are confident we can find a good base  setting very quickly and focus on race simulations. We are confident  that Michael and Tom can start on the front foot and we can start our  2021 season in a positive style.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “I am very  excited to finally get back racing, and what better way to do it than  to do it with a double header? We start in Aragón, which is obviously  a circuit I really enjoy riding. The target is quite clear for me: I  want to get back winning races and being consistently at the sharp and  the target for me as well as for the whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team.  On the other side, we have got a little bit of more work we need to do  in order to get to there. So we will see. For me, I just want to get a  good, clean start to the season and get some strong points on the  board from these two race weekends. Aragón is such an enjoyable track.  Also Estoril, a track which was my first time there last year.  Overall, I am very confident and can’t wait to get things started.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It  has been such a long time without any racing. Testing of course is  nice, riding the bike, developing the bike – but we are doing it all  for racing. It has been a long winter so I am really looking forward  to it and luckily we have two race weekends in a row. That is good,  and also at races we can learn a lot more about the bike and try to  develop it. In general, I think we are really well prepared, but for  sure we have to make some more steps with the bike in development. But  as I said, racing is always better as you can have a look at your  opponents and see their stronger points and their weaker points.  MotorLand Aragón is a nice track to start the season; especially after  the test we had there. For us that’s really positive. Estoril is a  lovely track as well. Last year, I had my debut on the BMW there, so  I’ve ridden the BMW on both tracks and that for sure helps to make it  a little bit easier. Regarding our goals for the first races: of  course, we always want to fight for the podium but at the moment we  are still developing the bike. I just want to get the best possible  result. We will always try our best but at the moment I am still a  little bit calm with expectations.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “This has been the  longest off-season of my entire career and I am so excited for the  season to finally begin. I have just three days of testing under my  belt but I was smiling the entire time that I was riding after such a  long period off the bike. I’m very happy with my new team RC Squadra  Corse; all the guys made me feel very welcome and we have gelled  immediately. I’m keen to realise the full potential of the new BMW M  1000 RR. The first two circuits of Aragón and Estoril were the  toughest on the calendar for us in 2020 and so they will provide the  biggest challenge. If we can be strong there then we can be strong anywhere.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “I am looking  forward to the season-opener, and to having two race weekends in a  row. That is obviously awesome. I hope we make a good start to the  season. We have done enough testing, and now it is finally time to go  racing. The goal for the season is to finish in the top ten, and it  would be great to really make a statement in one or two races. After  that, we’ll see what happens. I am intrigued to see what we can  achieve in the first few races.” Track Facts MotorLand Aragón.Circuit        length5.077 km – anti-clockwiseCorners17 – 7 right-handers,          10 left-handersPole        positionRightLongest        straight1,211 metresGrip        levelMediumTrack        layoutVery          long straight, flowing infieldStrain on        brakesMediumAmount at full        throttle27          seconds or 24.5 %Topspeed \/ lowest        speed322          km\/h \/ 65 km\/hBest overtaking        opportunityT1, T16Key        factorsEngine performance, good chassis, feeling on          the brakes  Track Facts Estoril.Circuit        length4.182 km – clockwiseCorners13 – 9 right-handers, 4 left-handersPole        positionLeftLongest        straight986 metres (start\/finish)Grip        levelMediumTrack        layoutUndulating (wheelie), some very tight cornersStrain on        brakesHighAmount at full        throttle22          seconds or 22.5 %Top-speed \/ lowest        speed288          kmph \/ 53 kmphBest overtaking        opportunityT1, T6, T9Key        factorsBraking performance, handling, stability  Note to editors: The two-part BMW M 1000 RR video documentary on the team launch of  the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team is available on YouTube and attached  here in the BMW Group PressClub: YouTube:b.mw\/Launch_2021_Part_1  and b.mw\/Launch_2021_Part_2 Attached, you will also find our comprehensive Media Guide,  containing all you need to know about BMW Motorrad Motorsport in  WorldSBK 2021, the new BMW M 1000 RR, the teams, and the riders. \n"}
{"prompt":"At the end of its series development process, the new edition of the sports car in the premium compact segment completes its driving dynamics tuning and testing run. Production starts in late summer 2021. ->","completion":" Munich. The new BMW 2 Series Coupé is on the final  stretch as it heads to the front row of the grid. The final phase of  the series development process for the new edition of the BMW 2 Series  Coupé has begun with the dynamic testing and tuning of its drive and  suspension systems under racetrack conditions. The two-door compact  sports car features numerous hallmark ingredients that are unique in  the premium compact segment for achieving a sporty and emotional  driving experience, which are carefully coordinated during the test  drives. This is what underpins this car’s claim to taking pole  position in its class. The unique selling points of the new BMW 2  Series Coupé in the competitive environment include the rear-wheel  drive setup, an extremely powerful in-line 6-cylinder engine, the  almost 50:50 balanced axle load distribution, an extremely torsionally  stiff body and chassis technology consistently designed for agile and  dynamic driving behaviour.Sporty driving pleasure in the tradition of the BMW  2002.The new BMW 2 Series Coupé, which will be  manufactured from late summer 2021, is designed for uncompromising  sporty driving pleasure. It continues the tradition of the brand's  particularly driver-oriented, compact and powerful two-door models,  which have been built since the legendary BMW 2002. In terms of power  delivery, traction, cornering dynamics and handling precision, the new  BMW 2 Series Coupé meets the needs of particularly discerning  customers who are enthusiastic about unadulterated sportiness in a  compact premium automobile.During the development of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé, the test and  tuning drives on the Nürburgring's Nordschleife serve as the ultimate  test for wheel suspension, chassis, damping, steering and braking  system. In addition, testing on public country roads around Munich and  at the BMW Group test site in Maisach ensure that the dynamic driving  qualities of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé can also be experienced in  everyday traffic and under different road conditions. By extensively  testing all drive and chassis systems, the development and test  engineers ensure that the engine's performance characteristics go hand  in hand with precisely controllable handling in every situation,  fascinating cornering dynamics, optimised traction in all weather and  road conditions and perfectly balanced ride comfort. At the same time,  the car is fine-tuned to optimise self-steering behaviour and the  dynamics when building up lateral acceleration forces. The power  transmission to the rear wheels, which is unique in the segment of the  new BMW 2 Series Coupé, is ideally suited to sporty, ambitious  cornering including easily controllable drift manoeuvres.BMW M version at the top of the model range.The  new BMW 2 Series Coupé's focus on maximum driving dynamics in the  segment is embodied particularly by the BMW M version at the top of  the model range. The BMW M240i xDrive Coupé top model (fuel  consumption combined: 8.2 l\/100 km, combined CO2 emissions: 186 g\/km;  provisional value according to WLTP) draws its drive torque from an  extremely powerful in-line 6-cylinder petrol engine with BMW TwinPower  Turbo technology. The drive, which is as spontaneously responsive as  it is powerfully thrusty, generates a maximum output of 275 kW\/374 hp  and is combined with an 8-speed Steptronic Sport transmission. The BMW  M model puts its power to the road using the intelligent BMW xDrive  all-wheel drive system. The system's rear-wheel oriented design  ensures hallmark BMW driving pleasure in conjunction with a power  distribution that adapts perfectly to adverse road and weather conditions.The driving dynamics tests also conducted on the Nürburgring, are  ideally suited for refining the interaction of the all-wheel-drive  system with the M sports differential in the rear-axle transmission.  With a fully variable locking effect generated by an electric motor,  the differential aids the new BMW 2 Series Coupé in optimising  cornering performance with regard to traction and driving stability.  The targeted distribution of power between the rear wheels enables  significantly higher lateral acceleration and also a noticeable  increase in dynamics when accelerating as you come out of bends.Vehicle concept designed for driving  dynamics.Regardless of the engine, all model variants  of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé benefit from a particularly  torsion-resistant body structure. Static torsional stiffness has been  increased by around 12 per cent compared to the predecessor model, for  example through the use of dynamic driving struts in the rear of the  vehicle, which contribute to the exceptionally high agility of the new  BMW 2 Series Coupé. In addition, the vehicle concept, which is  consistently designed for driving dynamics, offers significantly  increased track width at the front and rear axles. This effectively  reduces body roll and wheel load fluctuations during sporty cornering.All model variants of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé are also equipped  with stroke-dependent dampers as standard, the fine-tuning of which  leads to a noticeably optimised balance between sportiness and ride  comfort. They respond sensitively to slight road unevenness and  compensate vibrations to optimise comfort. When driving over large  bumps, the movements of the body are controlled by correspondingly  higher damper forces. An Adaptive M Chassis is offered as an option  for the new BMW 2 Series Coupé. Its electronically controlled dampers  offer the option of activating the appropriate mapping for both sporty  and comfort-oriented driving.Precise steering, optimised aerodynamic  properties.The new BMW 2 Series Coupé is characterised  by effortlessly controllable handling even in highly dynamic driving  situations. In addition to the powerful and highly controllable  brakes, the precise steering also characterises the handling of the  two-door model. In addition to the balanced axle load distribution  between the front and rear wheels, the model-specific design of the  steering and the particularly high connection stiffness of the support  bearings on the front axle contribute to this. Available as an option  for the new BMW 2 Series Coupé, Variable Sports Steering combines  further optimised precision when steering into bends with reduced  steering effort when parking and manoeuvring.The body design of the new BMW 2 Series Coupé not only reflects the  brand's modern, clear and reduced design language. Only visible at  second glance, but immediately noticeable during the high-speed test  drives at the Nürburgring, the measures that help optimise the  aerodynamic properties of the BMW M car in particular. In addition to  a model-specific front spoiler lip, front splitter and air curtains,  air deflectors, a tank and a rear axle cover as well as the contours  of the air-flow-optimised driving dynamics struts on the underbody  ensure that lift on the front axle has been reduced by 50 percent  compared to the predecessor model.\n"}
{"prompt":"MINI continues the realignment of its model range and announces the development of a successor to the open-top four-seater. ->","completion":" Munich. Electrification, the conquest of new target  groups and a consistent customer orientation are at the heart of the  realignment with which the British premium brand MINI is setting the  course for its future model range. Following the announcement of a new  generation of the brand's purely electric small cars, another decision  has now been made: The success story of the MINI Convertible will be  continued. The development of a successor to the only open-top  four-seater in the premium small car segment is a done deal. The new  model is scheduled to be unveiled in 2025. \"The MINI Convertible  has a large and particularly loyal fan base. This is also shown by the  great demand for the latest, freshly updated model,\" says Bernd  Körber, Head of the MINI brand. \"We are therefore firmly  convinced of the success of this vehicle concept for the future.\"With the new edition of the MINI Convertible launched a few weeks  ago, the brand's typical open-air driving pleasure has gained even  more appeal. The clear and reduced design expresses the vehicle's  extravagant charisma more intensively than ever - especially with the  body paint in the new Zesty Yellow variant available exclusively for  the MINI Convertible. In addition, the unmistakable design features of  the open-top MINI are showcased particularly effectively. The  hexagonal radiator grille is larger than ever, the standard LED  headlights have been redesigned as have the Side Scuttles, the black  wheel arch surrounds have been given new contours, and the rear lights  in the striking Union Jack design are now standard equipmentWith its fresh look, new standard and optional equipment and  innovative operating system, the MINI Convertible continues a success  story that began some three decades ago. After the prototype at the  British Motor Show in Birmingham in 1992 had already caused  enthusiastic reactions from the public, a convertible version was  added to the classic Mini for the first time. And even after the  relaunch of the brand, fans did not have to do without open-top  driving fun in typical MINI style. Since 2004, the combination of  go-kart feeling and open-air fun has thrilled discerning target groups  all over the world. At times, MINI's open-top four-seater was the  best-selling convertible in the world.The current MINI Convertible is not only the original in its vehicle  class, but also a true one-off as the only open-top model in the  premium small car segment. Three equally powerful and efficient  engines with MINI TwinPower Turbo technology ensure driving pleasure  made to measure. The MINI John Cooper Works Convertible (fuel  consumption combined: 7.4 - 7.1 l\/100 km according to WLTP, 7.4 - 7.1  l\/100 km according to NEDC; CO2 emissions combined: 167 - 161 g\/km  according to WLTP, 169 - 163 g\/km according to NEDC), with its 170  kW\/231 hp engine, makes the wind blow even more powerfully.The MINI Convertible enjoys particularly great popularity in the  German car market, followed by the USA and Great Britain. Especially  in these countries, but also in many other regions around the globe,  the news of the planned continuation of the model history is likely to  cause a sensation. \"Last year, almost one in five MINI customers  in Germany opted for open-top driving fun,\" said Bernd Körber.  \"This demonstrates the great enthusiasm of the MINI community for  a vehicle concept like this in the future.\" In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product  Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com Fuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption were    measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC)    2007\/715 as amended.

{"prompt":"High-grade Option 719 parts for perfect detail customisation available from September 2021. ->","completion":" Munich. The existing range of optional equipment and  the still growing range of Original BMW Motorrad accessories offer  many possibilities for customizing the R 18 and R 18 Classic according  to your own preferences. With the introduction of the Option 719  parts, BMW Motorrad is now adding features that enable highest-level  bike customisation based on historical roots. After all, the internal  code \"719\" at BMW Motorrad already stood for particularly  high-quality and exclusive special equipment, unusual special requests  and unique items decades ago. The new Option 719 parts will be  available from September 2021.Option 719 Design Package AERO.The Option 719  Design Package AERO includes the cylinder head covers on the left and  right, the front cover and the intake snorkel cover on the left and  right. All parts are made of aluminium sheet with a brushed,  colourless anodised surface. The cylinder head covers feature finely  wrought air vents reminiscent of the “streamliners” of the 1920s and  1930s. The highlight is a badge on the front and side covers: This is  made of solid copper which is chrome-plated and partially finished in  white. The white paint enclosing the number sequence “719” is  reminiscent of historical emblems that were typically lined with  enamel during that era.Option 719 seat.For the new R 18 and R 18 Classic, the Option 719 seat is a  particularly exclusive alternative to the standard seat. In addition  to the standard seat height, it offers a fascinating material  selection and finish. For example, two black upper materials are used,  which are combined with diamond-shaped quilted embossing. An  embroidered BMW logo and the 719 symbol on the side round off this  exclusive seat.Option 719 Paint finish Galaxy Dust metallic\/Titanium Silver 2 metallic.The colour Galaxy Dust metallic is a flip-flop finish that  shimmers in a spectrum from violet to turquoise blue, depending on the  incidence of light. In addition, the many large effect pigments create  a unique visual effect when exposed to sunlight. This special finish  is combined with a Titanium Silver 2 metallic mirror on the fuel tank.  The transition between the two colour surfaces consists of a  hand-applied smoke effect familiar from the legendary R 90 S. In  addition, the mirror surface is surrounded by a classic white double line.Option 719 Wheels AERO and ICON.The two Option 719 wheel sets AERO and ICON in the basic colours  matt silver and matt black, respectively, provide a particularly  refined and technically sophisticated look. The cast alloy wheels  feature a six-spoke design. The milled filigree ribs of the spokes are  a real eye-catcher. The milled areas give the aluminium a fascinating  contrast with the paint colour of the wheels - hence the name Contrast Cut.R 18 and R 18 Classic: Successful market launch with the First    Edition models.BMW Motorrad entered the cruiser segment with the market launch  of the R 18 in September 2020, followed in February 2021 by the R 18  Classic, the second member of the new model series. The R 18 Classic  embodies the nostalgic tourer, echoing the beginnings of the big  cruisers suitable for touring. Compared to the very purist R 18, the R  18 Classic is characterised above all by the large windshield, the  pillion seat, the saddlebags, the LED auxiliary headlights and the  16-inch front wheel.Both R 18 models are rooted in the tradition of historic BMW  motorcycles. Both technically and visually, they borrow from renowned  models such as the BMW R 5 and focus back on the essentials of the  motorcycle: purist, straight-up technology and the boxer engine as the  epicentre of riding pleasure, combined with \"good vibrations\".The very successful market launch of the BMW R 18 and the R 18  Classic was carried out with the First Edition models. Production of  these exclusive, limited-edition models will already cease at the end  of July 2021, after more than 13,000 units have been manufactured to date.You will find press material on BMW motorcycles and BMW Motorrad  rider equipment in the BMW Group PressClub at www.press.bmwgroup.com.In case of queries please contact:Dominik Schaidnagel, BMW Motorrad CommunicationsTel.: +49-89-382-50181, Dominik.Schaidnagel@bmw.deTim Diehl-Thiele, Head of Communications BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-57505, Tim.Diehl-Thiele@bmw.deJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communications MINI and BMW MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108, Jennifer.Ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.deInternet: www.press.bmw.deE-mail: presse@bmw.deThe BMW GroupWith its four brands BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad,  the BMW Group is the world's leading premium manufacturer of  automobiles and motorbikes and also provides premium financial and  mobility services.

{"prompt":"Ongoing expansion of the range of sounds for electric vehicles. BMW IconicSounds Electric enriches electric mobility with a fascinating and unmistakable sonic experience. Collaboration with the Academy Award winner produces a new, characteristic driving sound for the BMW i4, the M version of the BMW i4 and the BMW iX. ->","completion":" Munich.The future of driving pleasure is electric, locally emission-free –  and characterised by a typically BMW sporting flair expressed not only  in dynamic talent, but also through an emotionally rich aural  experience. BMW IconicSounds Electric brings an unmistakable sound  portfolio to BMW models powered by a fully electric or plug-in hybrid  drive system. The collaboration between composer and curator Hans  Zimmer and Renzo Vitale, Creative Director Sound at the BMW Group, has  produced a distinctive driving sound which customers will soon be able  to experience in a version developed specially for electric BMW M  cars. “Every BMW has its own character, which is reflected in the  sound it makes,” says film music creator and Academy Award winner  Zimmer. “So for the electrically driven BMW M models we have developed  a driving sound which accentuates their emotional driving experience  particularly vividly and ensures their performance can be felt with  even greater intensity.”Hans Zimmer had previously been involved in the development of an  inspiring ready-to-drive sound for electrically powered BMWs which  instils a sense of excitement at the prospect of electric driving when  the Start\/Stop button is pressed. The latest chapter in this  collaboration covers drive sounds for the BMW iX and BMW i4, including  a differentiated sound for the M-specification version of the BMW i4.While the hush of electric driving offers an unprecedented level of  comfort, the driving experience loses a degree of emotionality. This  is where BMW IconicSounds Electric steps in to put smiles on the faces  of customers keen to experience Sheer Driving Pleasure with all the  senses. In the future, electric driving pleasure will be enhanced by  acoustic feedback to every movement of the accelerator. Like the  on-board driving modes selectable at the touch of a button, the  driving sound also takes its cues from the driving situation at hand  and the driver’s personal preferences. In the basic setting, BMW  IconicSounds Electric employs a strikingly transparent timbre with  spherical components to convey the basic character of an electrically  driven BMW brand model. An immersive and pleasant atmosphere is  created initially in the BMW i4 in COMFORT mode. But when the driver  steps on the accelerator, the direct relationship between how the car  is being driven and the sounds it makes is immediately revealed: the  sound experience deepens as load and speed increase. In SPORT mode, in  particular, the car’s aural spectrum is more dominant and powerful,  the sound providing a constant commentary on the driving situation.  Drive system processes are registered within milliseconds and  acceleration, load changes or recuperation given a suitable acoustic  accompaniment. Only when the vehicle is travelling in ECO PRO mode is  the acoustic feedback reduced to nothing. Here, the silence of the  drive system underscores the driver’s decision to adopt an  ultra-efficient driving style.In the version developed specifically for electrified BMW M models,  the drive sound of the BMW i4 is charged with extra energy. Added to  which, the differentiation between COMFORT and SPORT mode is  especially strong. Overall, the drive system note displays a less  harmonious but engagingly rousing and technical sonic profile.  Acceleration sparks a rich intensification of the soundtrack’s  development, authentically reflecting the car’s performance character.  “When you press the pedal of an M car, you suddenly get goosebumps all  over your body,” says sound designer Renzo Vitale. “We translated this  feeling into a drive sound that expresses a fusion of superior power  and flowing energy.”Hans Zimmer and Renzo Vitale had already co-developed the driving  sound for the BMW Vision M NEXT revealed in 2019 and the BMW Concept  i4 presented the following year. Numerous learnings from this creative  process have now been channelled into the design of the sound for  future series-produced vehicles.The new drive sounds developed as part of the collaboration with Hans  Zimmer are expected to feature in the BMW i4 and BMW iX over the  course of 2022. IconicSounds Electric comes as standard in the BMW iX  and can be specified as an option for the BMW i4. In cars with earlier  build dates, the new sounds can be imported retrospectively via Remote  Software Upgrade, should the customer wish. The new spectrum includes  one ready-to-drive sound and one stop sound, plus a driving sound  which will be made available in the relevant version for BMW models  and BMW M cars with electrified drive system.\n"}

The BMW teams completed the final endurance test ahead of the    24-hour race at the Nürburgring (GER) this weekend, the six-hour    qualifying race. ROWE Racing, Schubert Motorsport, Walkenhorst    Motorsport and the BMW Junior Team were in action with their BMW M6    GT3s, as were countless other BMW teams in the various classes. The    dress rehearsal for the Eifel classic took place in glorious    weather, and the teams used the weekend to make preparations in race    conditions. The 49th running of the 24-hour race on the    Nordschleife will be held on 5th\/6th June. The best-placed BMW car in the final classification of the 24h  qualifying race was the #1 BMW M6 GT3 of ROWE Racing. The quartet of  drivers Nick Catsburg (NED), Nick Yelloly (GBR) John Edwards (USA) and  Philipp Eng (AUT) ended the race in P9, but then moved up into eighth  place. Their ROWE Racing team-mates in the #98 BMW M6 GT3 had  originally crossed the finish line in this position, but the car with  Connor De Phillippi (USA), Martin Tomczyk (GER), Sheldon van der Linde  (RSA) and Marco Wittmann (GER) at the wheel was disqualified for  violating the minimum number of laps per driver regulation. The #20 BMW M6 GT3 of Schubert Motorsport finished in P14. Jens  Klingmann (GER), Jesse Krohn (FIN) and Stef Dusseldorp (NED) shared  the cockpit of this car. Right behind them in P15 was the BMW Junior  Team in the #77 BMW M6 GT3. Dan Harper (GBR), Neil Verhagen (USA) and  Max Hesse (GER) are set to contest their first 24-hour race in the GT3  car. They will be supported by Augusto Farfus (BRA) in the cockpit.  The #102 BMW M6 GT3 of Walkenhorst Motorsport with Sami-Matti Trogen  (FIN), Jörg Müller (GER) and Jakub Giermaziak (POL) finished the race  in P18, which also saw them make the top 20. There were also several wins for the BMW teams in the individual  classes. Walkenhorst Motorsport won the SP10 class with the #74 BMW M4  GT4. This car was driven by Lance Boicelli, David Thilenius and  Charlie Postins (all USA). The other class winners in BMW cars  included Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive (CUP 5 with the  BMW M2 CS Racing and V2T with the BMW 330i GS20) and AVIA Sorg  Rennsport (BMW M240i). Markus Flasch, CEO of BMW M GmbH, also competed in the six-hour  qualifying race. He shared duties in the #241 BMW M2 CS Racing with  Matthias Malmedie, Jörg Weidinger und Nikolaus Schelle (all GER).  Adrenalin Motorsport Team Alzner Automotive was responsible for the  car’s outing. The quartet finished in fourth place of the CUP 5 class. Reactions to the qualifying race for 24h Nürburgring: Philipp Eng (#1 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “The race  was a lot of fun. The car felt great, we crossed off everything on our  to-do list and completed our programme. We also compared tyres. The  atmosphere in the team is really good, we’re all helping each other  out and are very open with each other. It’s a lot of fun, and now we  are all really looking forward to the big race at the beginning of June.” Marco Wittmann (#98 BMW M6 GT3, ROWE Racing): “Aside  from the subsequent penalty, our race was relatively unspectacular. We  started from eighth on the grid and crossed the finish line in the  same position. But our focus this weekend was on sorting a few things  out for the 24-hour race. I was at the wheel for the qualifying  session and a lap of the Nordschleife on your own without any traffic  is great fun. You can really push the car to the limit, and that is  every racing driver’s ultimate dream. Now we are all really looking  forward to the 24-hour race and are hoping for a good result there.” Jens Klingmann (#20 BMW M6 GT3, Schubert Motorsport):  “The weekend was hugely important to us, because we are still a little  behind in terms of experience, so we needed every kilometre. We  weren’t focussed on the result, we viewed the race as a test race,  tried to optimise our pace further, specifically for a long run, and  to fine-tune the set-up. We learned a great deal and I am confident  that we can improve our package even more in the coming weeks, and I’m  really looking forward to the 24-hour race.” Neil Verhagen (#77 BMW M6 GT3, BMW Junior Team): “I  am quite happy with the weekend. We definitely learnt a lot in the 24h  qualifying race, which was the main point for us. There are a lot of  things that we still need to smoothen out before the 24-hour race, and  getting the data and all the experience from this six-hour race  definitely will help us a lot to go and push in the big one. We had a  very strong car and if we get everything together then the result will  come. So there is a lot of positives to take away, and now the team  and us will work hard to make sure we are prepared as well as possible  for the 24h Nürburgring.” \n"}

In the seventh race of the season in the ABB FIA    Formula E World Championship, Maximilian Günther (GER) crossed the    finish line fifth in his adopted country, Monaco (MON). He just    missed out on the podium but equalled the best result of the season    and scored ten important points in the overall standings. After a    tight, thrilling race, Günther missed out on second place by just    four-tenths of a second in the #28 BMW iFE.21. Having won the    Valencia E-Prix (ESP), Jake Dennis (GBR) suffered back luck this    time. A not-at-fault collision early in the race put him at the back    of the field and he was unable to score any points. With the first    half of the season completed, BMW i Andretti Motorsport is now in    fifth place in the team standings with 55 points. Günther finished third in qualifying to reach Super Pole where he  secured fifth position on the grid. The BMW i Andretti Motorsport  driver was involved in some close-fought duels on the Formula 1  circuit in the principality. He moved up as high as third place and  was battling for his first podium finish of the season. Günther fell  back to fifth place as drivers attempted to get their ATTACK MODE  timings right, but sound energy management gave him the opportunity to  make up some ground towards the end of the race. A minor collision saw  Günther’s chance of a podium finish disappear however, when Oliver  Rowland (GBR, Nissan) clipped him from behind in the port chicane.  Victory went to António Félix da Costa (POR, DS Techeetah). Dennis’ first race in Monaco, and the first after his maiden Formula  E victory in Valencia, did not go according to plan. Starting from  14th on the grid, he was involved in a not-at-fault  accident on the very first lap and dropped to the back of the field.  He subsequently also received a drive-through penalty for excessive  energy use. Dennis finished the race in 16th place in the  #27 BMW iFE.21. The FIA Formula E Safety Car, the MINI Electric Pacesetter inspired  by JCW, pulled the field back together around 15 minutes before the  end after René Rast (GER, Audi) had retired, ensuring that there would  be plenty of excitement in the final stage of the race. Races eight and nine of this season’s ABB FIA Formula E World  Championship take place on 19th and 20th June in  Puebla (MEX). Reactions to Race 7 in Monaco. Roger Griffiths (BMW i Andretti Motorsport Team Principal,    team standings: 5th place):“It was fantastic to be back here in Monaco and race on the full  track. It’s been a day of mixed fortunes for our two drivers. Fifth  place for Maximilian after P5 in qualifying is a very good result.  It’s important for him to be back in the points and it’s also a good  finish for the team. Unfortunately for Jake it wasn’t the strong  result we had hoped for after such an impressive weekend in Valencia.  We go into the six-week break now and look forward to continuing our  progression up the standings.” Maximilian Günther (#28 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    5th place, race result: 5th place, points: 22,    driver standings: 16th place):“First of all P5 was a good start position for us. The race itself  was very spectacular and very strategic. When do you take the ATTACK  MODE, when do you use energy? Every overtaking move was right on the  edge. At one point I was running in P3 but then after the ATTACK MODES  I ended up in P5 fighting with Jean-Éric Vergne. He slightly touched  me in turn 6 and then had the better run through the tunnel to  overtake me. To sum it up, a bit of a shame to have missed the podium  here, but we had a good race and scored good points. That was  important for everybody.  All in all it was a positive day in Monaco.” Jake Dennis (#27 BMW iFE.21, starting position:    14th place, race result: 16th place, points:    33, driver standings: 10th place):“My race was a bit unfortunate. I was in the middle of the pack and  there was a backlog into turn 7. As I got hit, the car flipped into  reverse gear and I lost a lot of time. After that we managed the race  and hoped for a safety car. It came out towards the end but it just  wasn’t enough to gain a lot of positions. I think the biggest thing we  can take away from here is that we learned the track in Monaco. The  performance wasn’t that bad. It is what it is and we move on now.” The FANBOOST vote.FANBOOST gives Formula E fans the opportunity to vote for their  favourite driver and award them an extra boost of power during the  race.

{"prompt":"Statement Dr Peter Conference Call Q1 2021 ->","completion":" Ladies and Gentlemen, Good morning! The BMW Group made a good start to the financial year 2021. Our  operating result in the first quarter was at a very high level and we  exceeded market expectations. We achieved all of this despite growing headwinds from rising raw  material prices and in a market environment that remains volatile due  to the coronavirus pandemic. We were also able to maintain the supply of semiconductors in the  first quarter. As a result, there were no interruptions in production  during the reporting period. However, the situation remains difficult. Significantly improved pricing was a key driver for our strong Group  earnings. Additionally, the positive trend of the second half-year in  2020 continued during the first quarter in all major regions of the  world with over 636,000 vehicles delivered. In particular, our electrified vehicle fleet once again proved to be  an engine for growth. Our sales of electrified vehicles more than  doubled from the same period of last year to over 70,000 units (2020:  30,692, +129.8%). This means more than one in ten vehicles we sell is  already electrified. This underlines the high – and steadily growing –  importance of electromobility to our company. We took advantage of the past year to make ourselves more efficient  and more profitable for the long term. In addition to the better  pricing I mentioned before, this includes strict management of fixed  costs, a focus on controlling our inventory levels and cost-efficient  personnel structures. The company-wide Performance Programme continues to deliver important  contributions to sustainable earnings growth. Ladies and Gentlemen, All these factors are having a positive impact on our financial figures. Let’s now take a closer look at our financial performance. Group revenues for the first quarter of 2021 totalled around 26.8  billion euros (2020: 23.3 billion euros, +15.2%). Group earnings  before tax reached 3.76 billion euros (2020: 798 million euros) and  were therefore significantly higher than the previous year. The EBT  margin stood at 14%. The development in pre-owned car markets also contributed to the  margin increase through higher prices for the sale of end-of-lease vehicles. Manufacturing costs rose compared to the previous year, mainly driven  by the overall increase in sales volume and the growing share of  electrified vehicles. But also rising raw material prices contributed  to the increase. These increases, however, were partially offset by  lower risk provisioning. These results show that we remain on track with our transformation  process. Today’s profitability will secure our future competitiveness.  We continue to make systematic investments in important future areas  of activity, such as digitisation and electrification. This year  alone, two more all-electric vehicles will be released onto the  market: the BMW i4 and the BMW iX – important milestones in our  electromobility offensive. Research and development expenditure was almost on a par with last  year, at around 1.3 billion euros (2020: 1.34 billion euros\/-2.8%).  Our R&D ratio of 4.8% was lower than in 2020, due to the company’s  high revenues (2020: 5.7%). The ratio of capitalised development costs  of 22.6% was also lower year-on-year (2020: 28.4%). The financial result of 732 million euros for the first quarter  climbed more than 1.3 billion euros from the same period of last year  (2020: -577 million euros). One the one hand, this was mainly due to  significantly higher earnings of 503 million euros from BMW Brilliance  Automotive, which had been heavily impacted in the previous year by  China's lockdown in response to the pandemic (2020: 162 million euros). On the other hand, the other financial result improved significantly  year-on-year to reach a total of 334 million euros. This was due in  particular to positive valuation effects compared to the previous year. Group liquidity increased to 20.1 billion euros in the first quarter  – reflecting the strong operating result and positive free cash flow  (2020: 17.8 billion euros). Over the coming months, we will bring  liquidity back within our target range of 17-18 billion euros.Ladies and Gentlemen, Let's move on to the segments, beginning with the Automotive Segment. The segment’s EBIT margin for the first quarter was 9.8% and  underlines the company’s excellent performance. The key drivers here were the improved pricing, the significant  increase in sales and higher aftersales revenues. Significant growth  was posted by all three BMW Group brands: BMW (+36.1%), MINI (+15.9%)  and Rolls Royce (+61.8%). Rolls-Royce had its best quarter ever,  selling a total of 1,380 automobiles. At BMW, in addition to the  electrified vehicles, the BMW X models were especially in demand, as  well as the BMW 3 Series and BMW 5 Series. The high earnings quality is also reflected in our strong free cash  flow of 2.52 billion euros (2020: -2.218 billion euros). A key driver, in addition to the significant increase in earnings  before tax, was the strict management of our working capital. The segment’s net financial assets rose significantly year-on-year to  21.3 billion euros (2020: 18.5 billion euros) due to the strong free  cash flow. Let’s turn now to the Financial Services Segment. This segment also got off to a good start this year, with around  489,000 new financing and leasing contracts concluded with retail  customers during the reporting period. This represents a solid  increase of 8.8% over the previous year (2020: 449,687 contracts). The recovery in new business with retail customers can be attributed  to significant growth in financing business (+15.2%). Segment earnings before tax increased significantly to 787 million  euros (2020: 484 million euros, +62.6%). The improved result was mostly due to the positive development of the  pre-owned vehicle markets, and the related improvement in the risk  situation for the Segment. In the prior-year quarter, additional risk provisioning for  anticipated credit and residual value risks was needed, due to the  uncertainty created by the pandemic. Credit losses remain at a low level. The Financial Services Segment makes comprehensive provisions for its  main business risks on an ongoing basis. Current assessments confirm that residual  value and credit risks are appropriately covered. The Motorcycles Segment successfully continued its growth strategy in  the first quarter. Over the past year, 13 new models were released  onto the market. During the reporting period, more than 42,500  motorcycles were delivered to customers. This is significantly more than in the same period of last year  (+22.5%). The EBIT margin in this segment was 17.9% (2020: 12.9%). Ladies and Gentlemen, Let's take a look at our guidance for the year. We made a strong start to 2021. Despite this, we expect to see  increasing volatility and we will continuously reassess the risk situation. The semiconductor supply situation will remain difficult, for  instance. Additional headwinds are also expected due to rising raw  material prices, particularly for rhodium and palladium and steel. The volatile situation continues to affect the BMW Group’s business performance. Based on current information, we are able to confirm our guidance for  2021. The following forecast for the main key figures does not take  into account possible effects in connection with the European  Commission’s ongoing antitrust proceedings. We expect to see a significant increase in Group pre-tax earnings  this year. The Automotive Segment should post a solid increase in the number of  BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce vehicles delivered to customers compared to  the previous year. We expect the EBIT margin in the Automotive Segment to be at the  higher end of our target range of 6 to 8%, with a significant increase  in RoCE for the automotive business. Our share of electrified vehicles in our deliveries will also  continue to increase over the course of the year. In the Financial Services Segment, we expect return on equity to be  at the higher end of our target range of 12 to 15%. In the Motorcycles Segment, we anticipate a solid increase in  deliveries. The EBIT margin should be within our target range of 8 to  10% and RoCE for the segment should also be significantly higher year-on-year. Now, let’s take a look at the non-financial indicators. The percentage of female managers at the BMW Group will increase  slightly in 2021, as planned. We will significantly reduce CO₂ emissions in our new vehicle fleet  once again, from today's adjusted benchmark. According to the  planning, CO2 emissions per vehicle produced are likely to fall moderately. Thanks to ongoing personnel restructuring measures, it should be  possible to achieve the above-mentioned goals with a slightly smaller  workforce size than the previous year. Ladies and Gentlemen, Our thinking and actions are always geared towards the long term. We  are setting the right course today to achieve our short, medium and  long-term goals. This applies, in particular, to our focus areas of  digitalisation, electrification, and sustainability. Our products are in demand and our operating business is performing  well. For the remainder of the year, we expect a free cash flow of  over four billion euros.We have the right strategy to successfully continue our  transformation process based on our high profitability. And, although  we expect the second half of the year to be more volatile, we are  optimistic about the future. Thank you for your attention. \n"}
{"prompt":"Statement Zipse Conference Call Q1 2021 ->","completion":" Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. The BMW Group is a global company.We leveraged this strategic strength both during the financial year  2020 and in the first quarter of 2021. When the market situation is difficult in individual regions of the  world, the other markets carry us through. Since the start of the pandemic, we have done everything possible to  create a safe working environment for our employees. We also offer  safe and contact-free delivery of vehicles to customers. In more than 60 markets we have set up Mobile Sales Offices. Our new  Customer, Brands and Sales System is taking advantage of the momentum  and growing acceptance of digital services that has been building over  the past year. Our strong results underline the viability of our business model –  even during one of the worst crises the global economy has faced. It  is robust, in demand all over the world and full of innovations. In many areas, we have picked up the pace once again. I would like to give you a brief overview, focusing on three main points:  Let's start with the first point. The BMW Group delivered excellent results in the first quarter of 2021.  This shows clearly: our strategy is having a real impact. The Automotive Segment delivered an EBIT margin of 9.8 percent in the  first quarter – back within our strategic medium-term target range for  the first time in ten quarters. As in the past, this EBIT margin does  not include the at-equity result from our BBA joint venture in China. Another indicator of our operating strength is our free cash flow of  2.5 billion euros in the Automotive Segment – our best figure ever for  a first quarter. Our first-quarter deliveries also reached a new all-time high.  Compared with the first quarter of 2019 – in other words, the  comparable period before the crisis – Group sales increased by six percent. Our total market share worldwide has climbed up to 3.3 percent –  from 2.9 percent in the same period 2019. Our performance in the Chinese market stands out, in particular.  Compared to the first quarter of 2019 – again, pre-crisis – our China  sales increased by more than 36 percent. We recently presented our model line-up for our largest market at  Auto Shanghai 2021. With highly innovative, digitalised, electric and,  above all, exceptionally high-quality products, like the BMW iX3, the  BMW iX and the BMW i4, we intend to sustain our growth in China. Our electrified models are also in high demand globally. In the first  quarter, we were the biggest manufacturer of plug-in hybrids worldwide. With more than 70,000 electrified vehicles sold in the first three  months of 2021, we are on track to have a total of one million  fully-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids on the roads by the end of  the year. This also illustrates the success of our flexible architecture strategy. The BMW iX3 is receiving consistently outstanding ratings from the  automotive press: not only because of its many impressive  characteristics – such as its quality, comfort, connectivity,  operating ease and dynamic performance – but also its range. Its efficient drive train puts it on a par with electric models with  the highest ranges among all brands within its segment. Just yesterday, I met with journalists testing pre-production models  of the BMW i4. This car will put e-mobility right at the heart of the  BMW brand. I am extremely confident we will be able to build on our e-mobility  successes with the BMW i4 and BMW iX. Growth remains our industry’s strongest currency. Before the end of the decade, we want to reach the milestone of three  million delivered vehicles annually. As far as the BMW Group is  concerned, we are also growing profitably and sustainably – and we  will make sure this continues. That brings me to my second point:We are growing sustainably. Sustainability is the new language that connects the world. The three major world markets, Europe, the US and China, as well as  other industrial nations, have set themselves ambitious goals on the  road to climate neutrality. They have recently confirmed – and even  stepped up – these targets. The next big, binding step will be the year 2030 – also for the BMW Group. We have geared our company entirely towards sustainability. By 2030,  we aim to reduce our actual carbon footprint per vehicle by at least a  third from 2019 levels – in a verifiable and transparent manner,  everywhere around the world. During our Annual Conference, we published an integrated BMW Group  Report for the first time, which documents our progress and, most  importantly, gives equal weighting to our sustainable development and  financial indicators. A company does not become sustainable simply by flipping a switch or  buying certificates. What counts is not alleged sustainability – but  verifiable measures that deliver a real impact. That is why we joined the Science Based Targets Initiative. We think about sustainability in a way that goes far beyond emissions. Energy and resource consumption will be the next, much bigger issue.Raw materials are becoming more expensive. Water and many mineral  resources are scarce and valuable commodities. We are seeing that especially right now. This is why it is so  important to think in terms of a circular model and reduce our use of  materials from the outset. To achieve this, we are relying on partnerships and collaboration  across our industry, with NGOs as well as political institutions.This requires hard work, investment and an ongoing commitment.We firmly believe: we will add value for society in this way, and  also become a stronger company in the long term.  Let me give you a few examples from the last few months alone:        All these examples show that:Sustainability cannot be taken for granted. It takes a lot of  different measures to achieve a large-scale effect – as well as a  conscious openness towards choosing the most effective technology in  each case. Our ambition is clear:The greenest electric car will be a BMW. However, we also know that we always have to – and we will – combine  sustainability with technology, innovation and inspiring products for  our customers. That is the BMW way. And we will continue full speed ahead. That brings me to my third and final point: We are shaping the technology for tomorrow’s mobility.    We are electrifying all our brands to achieve this.    We will also be introducing our new and self-developed BMW Operating  System 8 with the BMW iX: a new generation of performance, user  experience and intelligent driver assistance. In combination with high-performance hardware, we are capable of  processing more data live than ever before. The data transfer is 10 to  20 times faster than in previous systems.We have also enhanced our award-winning and safe display and  operating concept.  BMW Operating System 8 is designed for 5G connectivity, with complete  functionality for applications like our powerful cloud-based  navigation software BMW Maps.  Third-party services can be fully integrated into the operating  system. This applies, for instance, to services from Apple,  Google, Tencent and Spotify, which can transform the vehicle into the  perfect digital companion. We already introduced over-the-air updates for our vehicles with  BMW Operating System 7. More than one million vehicles have already  received upgrades. This was a huge success that we will continue to build on. In many  cases, our vehicles can be configured with functions on demand at a  later date. By the end of the year, we will have the largest connected fleet in  the world, with around 2.5 million vehicles with Remote Software  Upgrade capabilities. And we are already planning the next big step. At the Annual Conference, we unveiled the broad strokes of our  vehicle strategy from the middle of the decade:the Neue Klasse – electric, digital and circular. It will be key to the future success of the BMW Group. We are putting  all our know-how and considerable investment into this development. The Neue Klasse will establish a new generation of technology modules  – targeting maximum synergies and scalability for our entire vehicle portfolio. We will be introducing a new digital architecture and a new  generation of electrical system. We will also be taking the next leap with our electric powertrain and  leveraging the opportunities of the new architecture to redesign our  batteries. At our Battery Cell Competence Centre, we are currently  testing different cell chemistries, formats and modules. We aim to realise an automotive-compatible solid-state battery in  collaboration with the battery specialist Solid Power by the end of  the decade. We will present an initial demonstrator vehicle with these  batteries well before 2025. Ladies and Gentlemen, The BMW Group is on course for success. We are growing and reaching more customers than ever. We are  focused on our goal of reaching three million units sold in a single  financial year within this decade. In recent years, we have been working hard to get back on a  profitable track. Today, we are seeing the benefits of this strategy. We are setting the standard with our sustainable global business model.We will eliminate mobility as a climate factor in the long term – by  implementing impactful and transparent measures in the BMW style. And we are paving the way for the next leaps in technology – that  will inspire our customers even ten years from now. Thank you for your attention. \n"}

With two weeks to go until the start of the 2021    season in the FIM FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK), BMW    Motorrad Motorsport has entered a crucial phase of preparations.    MotorLand Aragón, the Spanish circuit that will host the opening    races of the year, was the venue for this week’s intensive tests    with the new BMW M 1000 RR. Among those attending were the factory    team, the BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team, with riders Tom Sykes (GBR)    and Michael van der Mark (NED), as well as the two BMW satellite    teams: Bonovo MGM Racing with Jonas Folger (GER) and RC Squadra    Corse with Eugene Laverty (IRL). The test was primarily used to test further developments and  fine-tune the bikes to the individual needs of the riders ahead of the  start of the season. Working closely together, and blessed with ideal  conditions in the Spanish sun, the teams and riders gained a lot of  valuable information for their final preparations. WorldSBK kicks off the 2021 season with a double-header. The action  takes place from 21st to 23rd May at MotorLand Aragón. Round two of  the season follows just one week later (28th to 30th May), at Estoril, Portugal. Quotes after the test at MotorLand Aragón. Marc Bongers, BMW Motorrad Motorsport Director: “It  was the last test before it really gets serious – on this same track.  Again, we had productive days under perfect weather conditions without  any large technical issues so we could clearly conduct our test plan.  Already, the satellite teams have shown added value for us because we  can get more confirmation and we can share the test points so we can  get through more work. That is very positive, we still have some  homework to do before the first race but I am confident we will get  there and already in some areas it’s a clear improvement, like top  speed, brakes and so on. Overall I am happy and I am very much looking  forward to finally race.” Shaun Muir, Team Principal BMW Motorrad WorldSBK  Team: “It was good to get to the final test in pre-season  preparation at Aragón. We again had good conditions. I think we have  been very fortunate this year with the late start of the season and  selecting to start our testing late has paid dividends. On track  activities - we have been focusing on chassis and electronic work. I  think it is fair to say that we have completed most of that; we have a  good direction going into the Aragón race weekend. Lap times are  difficult to judge as from starting at ten o’clock to the middle of  the day and the end of the day, it is difficult to tell who was  running what tyres. But it is clear that the race pace is very strong  from last year to this year from the competition and we need to be on  point come Aragón race to be in contention for the podium.  Nevertheless, we are happy where we are and we look forward to the  first round.” Tom Sykes, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team: “It has been a  very productive test. We have done such a lot now with the electronics  all over, the traction control, the engine brake, the power level  maps. We’ve also been working with different chassis configurations  and set-up and were also trying some things with the engine. Apart  from that it was quite some other fundamental things that we have been  trying. So overall, they have been very busy days. A big thanks to the  whole BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team that has put in very long hours on  all the preparations. We just need to go back now and use all this  information but certainly there has been a lot gathered and I really  feel we can improve the whole package of the new BMW M 1000 RR. I am  looking forward to the first races now.” Michael van der Mark, BMW Motorrad WorldSBK Team:  “They have been fantastic days. All days, the weather was good. On  Monday, it was a bit cold but then it got warmer and warmer so we got  a lot of different weather and track conditions and this was really  good. It was perfect to test here just before the first race. A lot of  things to try, a lot of things to improve but I am really happy with  the progression we are making. Of course it’s always difficult to see  where you are at a test but we will find out at the race weekends. I  am looking forward to some good battles again and to fight with the  other guys on track.” Jonas Folger, Bonovo MGM Racing: “That was our final  test before the start of the season. We once again used the time to  test all our options and directions, from the chassis to the  electronics. We learned a lot, so we are well-prepared for the first races.” Eugene Laverty, RC Squadra Corse: “First and  foremost, I am so happy to be back on a bike after six and a half  months off. The big surprise for me was that after this period I was  able to get back on my bike and within two exists be on a good pace.  So we had three really good days, good weather, surprisingly fast lap  times and my main focus has been to improve the baking performance and  we did that. So, job well done and I am really happy with my RC  Squadra Corse team. Now I am looking forward to the first round here  at Aragón after our successful test.” \n"}

The virtual art installation premieres in  conjunction with Frieze New York 2021, as well as the 50th  anniversary of BMW Group Cultural Engagement. Content and videos  documenting its creation process are available today online via www.bmw.com“The Ultimate AI Masterpiece” virtual art installation was created in  partnership with creative technologist Nathan Shipley of Goodby,  Silverstein & Partners, and Gary Yeh, Art Collector & Founder  of ArtDrunk. The duo leveraged Nvidia’s open source “StyleGAN”  artificial intelligence software to cross-reference over 50,000 images  of artwork spanning 900 years of art history and a curated set of 50  works from renowned and emerging contemporary artists BMW has worked  with over the past 50 years. Using these inputs as a basis for  understanding art, the artificial intelligence then generates entirely  new works of art, merging what it learned from classical art and the  styles noted from the contemporary artists. These new works have been  projection-mapped onto a virtual rendition of BMW’s range-topping 8  Series Gran Coupe.“For 50 years, BMW has supported the arts and culture through  numerous initiatives as a way to engage and interact with consumers  around the world in an authentic way,” said Uwe Dreher, vice president  of marketing, BMW of North America.  “As we continue these efforts  into 2021 and look for new and creative ways to engage audiences, we  shift to a virtual setting where we are combining centuries-old art  and the latest AI technology to create something completely new and exciting.”To document the creative process behind the virtual installation,  Shipley and Yeh collaborated digitally from different parts of the  world – Yeh in Seoul, Shipley in San Francisco – and virtually joined  each other for an engaging conversation on the technology behind the  artwork created by the AI, as well as BMW’s decades-long support of  the arts. “The Ultimate AI Masterpiece” documentary video is available  at www.bmw.com“AI is an emerging medium of creative expression. It’s a fascinating  space where art meets algorithm,” said Nathan Shipley. “Combining the  historical works with the curated modern works and projecting the  evolving images onto the 8 Series Gran Coupe serves a direct nod to  BMW’s history of uniting automobiles, art, and technology.”“During an unusually isolated time in history, we took the  opportunity to curate and work with artists from around the world as a  means to give viewers a true art experience digitally,” said Gary Yeh.  “It was particularly exciting to push the boundaries of art, see how  technology may influence the art world in the years to come, and build  on 50 years of cultural engagement at BMW.”Today, BMW is committed to cultural engagement around the world and  takes its social responsibility seriously as a corporate citizen. Over  a hundred long-term cultural initiatives in the fields of modern and  contemporary art, classical music, jazz and sound as well as in  architecture and design have been well established throughout the  decades. Together with other partners, the BMW Group developed its own  range of partnerships and activations with renowned artists,  musicians, designers, curators, initiatives including the BMW  Guggenheim Lab, BMW Tate Live, BMW Open Work by Frieze, the BMW Welt  Jazz Award, the BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors, the BMW Art  Journey and the free concert series Opera for all in Berlin, Munich,  Moscow and London.From May 5-9, 2021, Frieze New York runs its tenth edition, taking  place for the first time at The Shed in Manhattan. Reimagined for its  new location, the fair brings together over 60 major galleries and  sees a strong representation from New York, celebrating the creative  spirit of the city. A dedicated edition of Frieze Viewing Room will  run parallel to the fair, through May 14, and will feature an expanded  list of over 160 exhibitors, connecting international galleries and  audiences unable to travel.

{"prompt":"With optional roof rails and a wide range of retrofit products for the exterior and interior, the first purely electrically powered model from the British premium brand also becomes the perfect companion for active leisure activities and excursions into nature.  ->","completion":" Munich. The temperatures are rising and with them the  anticipation of outdoor activities and excursions into nature. The  model-specific railing and roof rack systems from the MINI Genuine  Accessories range create ideal conditions for leaving the limits of  urban mobility behind and combining driving pleasure with active  leisure activities. The MINI Cooper SE (combined power consumption:  17.6 - 15.2 kWh\/100 km according to WLTP, 16.9 - 14.9 kWh\/100 km  according to NEDC) is a particularly sustainable escape from everyday  life. The MINI Cooper SE is the only fully electric model in its competitive    class, that can be equipped with optional roof rails and a wide    range of retrofit products. This means that nothing stands in  the way of locally emission-free transport of roof boxes, bicycles or  other sports and leisure utensils.With a range of 203 to 234 kilometres determined in the WLTP test  cycle, the MINI Cooper SE is ideally equipped to explore new routes  away from the urban jungle. And when it comes to versatility and  transport capacities, the first purely electrically powered model from  the British premium brand is in no way inferior to the conventionally  powered variants of the MINI 3-door. With all four seats utilised, its  luggage compartment volume is also 211 litres. And after folding down  the rear seat backrest, which can be divided in a 60 : 40 ratio, the  storage space increases to 731 litres, just like in a MINI 3-door with  an internal combustion engine. And that's not all: the railing and  roof rack systems from the MINI Genuine Accessories range turn the  electrified model into a versatile transport talent in no time at all.The conditions for this are created by the roof rails in matt black,  which are available directly from production site. On the roof of the  MINI Cooper SE, it forms the stable basis for various fastening and  transport systems, which are available in the MINI Genuine Accessories  range for both the MINI Cooper SE and the conventionally powered MINI  3-door and MINI 5-door models. For example, the railing rack available  there as a retrofit product enables the MINI roof box to be locked in  place comfortably and securely. With a tare weight of 13 kilograms, it  offers a capacity of 320 litres. This provides sufficient space for  sports clothing, bicycle helmets or even camping and picnic equipment.  Even skis can be stored in the roof box, which is around 1.90 metres  long. The all-black box has embossed stripes and MINI lettering. It is  lockable and can be opened on both sides.Because the brand's typical principle of creative use of space also  applies to the roof of the MINI Cooper SE, there is even room for a  bicycle next to the roof box. With the touring bike holder, which is  also available in the MINI Genuine Accessories range, two-wheelers of  different types and sizes can be mounted upright and securely on the  railing carrier. The holder made of high-strength aluminum fixes the  bike with a lockable clamping system and two tension straps. In  addition, the range includes other transport solutions such as ski  racks and an aluminum luggage basket, which are also compatible with  the railing carrier.The MINI Cooper SE becomes the ideal companion for a short trip or  weekend excursion with the model-specific Travel & Comfort System.  It consists of a basic carrier that can be firmly mounted between the  headrest rails of the driver's or front passenger's seat. Various  system attachments can be quickly and conveniently slipped on and  snapped into place. For example, holders for tablets or hangers and  universal hooks for bags can be securely attached to the backrests of  the front seats.In addition, a folding table that can be used as a work or storage  surface can be attached to the basic support of the Travel &  Comfort System. It can be adjusted in height and inclination as needed  and is held securely on the backrest of the seat. Another clever  detail of the folding table is the foldable cup holder. An ideal  solution in the fight against impatience and boredom in the rear of  the MINI Cooper SE is the universal holder for tablets with a screen  diameter of between seven and eleven inches. It ensures that the  tablet is securely fastened in an ergonomically optimal position,  making it easy to start an individual entertainment programme for the  passengers in the rear seats on longer trips beyond the city limits. In case of queries, please contact:Corporate CommunicationsJulian Kisch, Press Spokesperson Product  Communication MINITel.: +49-89-382-38072E-mail: julian.kisch@mini.comAndreas Lampka, Head of Communication MINITel.:  +49-89-382-23662E-mail: andreas.lampka@mini.comJennifer Treiber-Ruckenbrod, Head of Communication MINI and BMW  MotorradTel.: +49-89-382-35108E-mail: jennifer.ruckenbrod@bmwgroup.com Fuel consumption, CO2 emission figures and power consumption were    measured using the methods required according to Regulation VO (EC)    2007\/715 as amended.

BMW brand ambassador Alessandro Zanardi (ITA) has now    started the process of rehabilitation after his serious handbike    accident in June 2020. He has been constantly in the thoughts of the    BMW family since that accident and countless fans around the world    have been sending him their best wishes. Thanks to his fighting    spirit and his impressive personality, Zanardi has become an idol    for many. Some insights into this personality are also provided by a    50-minute documentary that was filmed over several months in 2018    and 2019 as Zanardi prepared for the Rolex 24 at Daytona (USA) in    the BMW M8 GTE: “Alex Zanardi – Disability is all relative”. This    documentary will be broadcast on Sunday (2nd May) on the    German TV channel Sky Sport F1. Zanardi has now begun a programme of rehabilitation after his  accident and is in very good hands. It is a very lengthy healing  process, in which there are rays of hope, but unfortunately there are  also repeated complications. His family have granted their permission  for the documentary to be shown. Zanardi himself viewed it before his  accident and was thrilled with the emotional and impressive way in  which his “Road to Daytona” is represented in this film. The title of the documentary reflects Zanardi’s attitude to life:  “Disability is all relative”. In his opening quote, he says: “We all  have to deal with restrictions in a certain way. It is all relative.  Life is a journey and we have to accept our limits. No person can fly  like a bird, so you try to deal with the problem if you cannot  overcome it.” Viewers then get to see exclusive insights into the  collaboration between Zanardi and BMW Motorsport, including some  unique scenes from the races at Misano (ITA) and Daytona that will  send shivers down the spine.  Zanardi’s appearance in the BMW M8 GTE for the BMW Team RLL at the  “24 Hours of Daytona” in January 2019 was one of countless highlights  in a long history of collaboration between Zanardi and BMW Motorsport  that stretches back to 2003 and which has witnessed him repeatedly  dealing with restrictions. The Daytona project kicked off in the  spring of 2018. This time, the greatest challenge was adjusting the  BMW M8 GTE to meet Zanardi’s requirements as he needed to be able to  compete in an endurance race without his prostheses: Zanardi  accelerated, braked, steered and changed gear using just his hands.  The Rückenwind Film crew accompanied him all the way through the  process – from initial preparations in Munich (GER) to the finish of  the 24-hour race. They were with Zanardi on his “Road to Daytona” for  eight months. The 50-minute documentary “Alex Zanardi – Disability is all relative”  will be broadcast this Sunday, 2nd May, at 19:30 CEST on  German Sky Sport F1. The documentary is also available on Amazon (in  Germany, UK and USA). \n"}

BMW M Motorsport has now taken the next important    step in the development of the new BMW M4 GT3. The new flagship in    the portfolio of cars from BMW M Motorsport successfully completed a    series of test drives on the Nürburgring Nordschleife (GER) on    Thursday. The two BMW works drivers Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Jens    Klingmann (GER) shared driving duties. The special characteristics of the over 20 kilometres of the  Nürburgring Nordschleife make it the perfect testing ground for the  development of new race cars. It is a very long track with plenty of  options, and its combination of high speeds, fast corners and  significant climbs and descents provide everything that BMW M  Motorsport engineers require for comprehensive vehicle testing. A race  car that emerges from testing on the Nordschleife is well prepared to  take on all other racetracks. Thursday's testing focused on gaining initial experience on the most  challenging racetrack in the world, especially with regard to the  durability of components under extreme levels of stress imposed by the  Nordschleife and driving behaviour in those very specific series of  corners. First impressions were very positive for the drivers. “The debut of the BMW M4 GT3 on the Nordschleife went very well,”  said Klingmann. “My initial feedback is that the BMW M4 GT3 has  retained the strengths of its predecessor on the Nordschleife, while  eradicating its weaknesses. Of course, it’s not possible to transfer  that 1:1 to other circuits from such a special track, but as a driver  you feel right at home from the word go in the BMW M4 GT3. It is not  unpredictable, but it’s fast nonetheless. It was really great fun.” Farfus said: “It is a great honour for me to be involved so  intensively in the development of the BMW M4 GT3, and to have been  there for the first laps on the legendary Nordschleife. Many thanks to  BMW M Motorsport! It is always special to hit the track for the first  time in a new car, as you never know what to expect and how the car  will behave. The BMW M4 GT3 made a good impression.

{"prompt":"BMW Group now producing high-voltage batteries and battery components at three locations in Germany alone: Dingolfing, Leipzig and Regensburg  Less than a year from decision to start of production in Leipzig and Regensburg  Production of battery components for BMW Group’s fifth generation of fully-electric vehicles ->","completion":"  Munich\/Leipzig\/Regensburg. The BMW Group is launching  production of battery components at its plants in Leipzig and  Regensburg and expanding its e-drive production network. It has been  less than a year since the decision was made to expand production  capacity for e-drives in Germany. BMW Group Plant Leipzig will launch  series production of battery modules on Monday, 3 May 2021, while BMW  Group Plant Regensburg began coating battery cells for high-voltage  batteries in April 2021. High-voltage batteries will also be produced  in Regensburg from 2022. “We expect at least 50 percent of the  vehicles we deliver to our customers worldwide to be fully electric by  2030,” said Michael Nikolaides, Senior Vice President Production  Engines and E-Drives. “And we are systematically expanding our  production network for electric drive trains in response to this.”The company is investing more than 250 million euros in its  Regensburg and Leipzig locations alone to supply the BMW Group’s  growing number of electrified vehicles with high-voltage batteries.  High-voltage battery components will be used in production of the BMW  iX* and BMW i4, both of which will be released onto the market  shortly. The production systems are highly flexible and will also  supply battery components for other BMW Group electrified vehicles in  the future.“We are increasing capacity at existing locations and developing  capabilities at others. In this way, we can make the most of our  associates’ expertise and experience and offer them long-term, secure  jobs,” Nikolaides added. The BMW Group is investing a total of around  790 million euros in expanding production capacity for drivetrain  components for electrified vehicles at its Dingolfing, Leipzig,  Regensburg and Steyr locations between 2020 and 2022.Production of battery modules at BMW Group Plant LeipzigLeipzig is the BMW Group’s pioneer plant for electromobility and has  been building the BMW Group’s first fully-electric vehicle, the BMW  i3*, since 2013. Now, the location will also produce electric  drivetrain components.“We are continuing on this track with the launch of battery module  production and further enhancing the plant’s future viability for  electromobility,” confirmed Hans-Peter Kemser, Plant Director of BMW  Group Plant Leipzig. “Plant Leipzig will play an important role in  supplying the growing number of BMW Group electrified vehicles with  battery components.” The successor to the MINI Countryman, scheduled  to come off the production line in Leipzig from 2023, will be released  onto the market with an electric drive train. “The expertise and  experience gained by staff at our location over the years can be put  to good use. Construction of the battery module lines will make a  major contribution to long-term job security,” emphasised Kemser.From May 2021, the 10,000 sq. m. production area previously reserved  for the BMW i8 will be used for manufacturing battery modules.  Production will get underway with 80 employees working in battery  module production; by the end of the year, there will be a staff of  around 150. The company will invest more than 100 million euros in the  initial phase of battery module production at the Leipzig location  between 2020 and 2022.However, the production line for battery modules that just ramped up  is only the beginning: The company has already decided to further  increase capacity for battery module production at its Leipzig  location. A second production line will come on stream in 2022. This  will ensure the company has sufficient volumes to meet growing demand  for drivetrains.Production of battery components and high-voltage    batteries at BMW Group Plant RegensburgBMW Group Plant Regensburg already produces two electrified models –  plug-in hybrid variants of the BMW X1* and BMW X2* – and will start  building the fully-electric BMW X1 in 2022. The site's e-mobility  expertise and experience will now also be used in production of  battery components and high-voltage batteries.The first of four coating lines for fifth-generation battery cells  went on stream in April 2021, occupying a production and logistics  area of more than 40,000 sq. m. “Regensburg has made a successful  start to production of electric drivetrain components – this is an  important milestone in our transformation,” according to Frank  Bachmann, Plant Director of BMW Group Plant Regensburg. The three  other systems will ramp up in stages between now and the end of 2021  to supply the growing volumes needed for the BMW Group’s fully  electric vehicles. Up until now, battery cells have been coated at BMW  Group Plant Dingolfing and the BMW Brilliance Automotive Plant  Powertrain in Shenyang, China.Coating increases the battery cell’s mechanical robustness and  thermal conductivity. This helps improve insulation and cooling of the  fifth-generation e-drive’s even more powerful battery cells. From  2022, the plant in Regensburg will produce high-voltage batteries from  battery modules. A total of 100 employees already work in battery  component production at the Regensburg site; by the end of 2022, there  will be more than 300. The company will invest more than 150 million  euros in ramping up production of battery components and high-voltage  batteries between 2020 and 2022.Holistic approach to sustainabilityThe BMW Group has a clear mission to ensure the “greenest electric  vehicle comes from the BMW Group”, starting in production. The BMW  Group already sources only green power for its manufacturing locations worldwide.The BMW Group’s energy goals are geared towards the long term. The  company reduced its emissions per vehicle produced by more than 70  percent between 2019 and 2006.The aim is to lower these CO2 emissions  by another 80 percent by 2030. This means the BMW Group will have  reduced its CO2 emissions from production to less than ten percent of  what they were in 2006.A further corporate objective is to reduce CO2 emissions in the  supplier network by 20 percent by 2030. At the same time, the BMW  Group has reached an agreement with its suppliers that they will only  use renewable green power for producing fifth-generation battery    cells.From battery cell to high-voltage batteryProduction of high-voltage batteries can be broken down into two  stages: Battery modules are produced in a highly automated process.  The lithium-ion cells first undergo a plasma cleaning, before a  specially developed system coats the cells to ensure optimal  insulation. Next, the battery cells are assembled into a larger unit,  the so-called battery module. The BMW Group obtains its battery cells  from partners who produce them to the company’s exact specifications.  The BMW Group uses different battery cells, depending on which  provides the best properties for each vehicle concept.The battery modules are then installed in an aluminium housing,  together with the connections to the vehicle, and the control and  cooling units. The size and shape of the aluminium housing and the  number of battery modules used differ according to the vehicle  variant. This ensures the high-voltage battery is optimally adjusted  to the vehicle.Global e-drive production network focused in GermanyThe high-voltage batteries and battery components needed for all BMW  and MINI electrified vehicles come from the company’s own battery  factories in Dingolfing, Leipzig and Regensburg in Germany, as well as  from Spartanburg (USA) and Shenyang (China). The BMW Group has also  localised production of high-voltage batteries in Thailand, at its  Rayong plant, and is working with the Dräxlmaier Group for this.  Munich is home to the e-drive pilot plant and the Battery Cell  Competence Centre, where the BMW Group is conducting a full analysis  of battery cell value creation processes and refining technology for  its production processes.The company produces electric motors at the Competence Centre for  E-Drive Production in Dingolfing and at BMW Group Plant Landshut. BMW  Group Plant Steyr builds the housing for the highly integrated  fifth-generation e-drive.With the BMW Group’s electro-offensive now in full swing, increased  production capacity is needed for electric drivetrain components.  Thanks to intelligent vehicle architectures and a highly flexible  production network, the BMW Group will have about a dozen  fully-electric models on the roads from 2023. The BMW i3*, MINI Cooper  SE* and BMW iX3* already on the market will be joined later this year  by the BMW iX* and BMW i4. Between now and 2025, the BMW Group will  increase its sales of fully-electric models by an average of well over  50 percent per year – more than ten times the number of units sold in  2020. By the end of 2025, the company will have delivered a total of  around two million fully-electric vehicles to customers. Based on  current market forecasts, the BMW Group expects at least 50 percent of  its global sales to come from fully-electric vehicles in 2030. In  total, over the next ten years or so, the company will release about  ten million fully-electric vehicles onto the roads.This means the BMW Group is strategically on track to reach the  European Union’s ambitious CO2 reduction targets for 2025 and 2030 as well.\n"}

In our monthly BMW SIM News, we  briefly summarise news from the world of virtual racing, and provide  information on driver backgrounds, teams, technology, and much more.  Over the year, we also regularly focus on individual subjects in  separate press releases. Kevin Siggy at the wheel of a real Formula E car. A dream came true for BMW Team Redline driver Kevin Siggy (SLO) last  weekend. Ahead of the Valencia E-Prix in the ABB FIA Formula E World  Championship, he was able to claim his prize for topping the overall  standings in the 2020 ‘ABB Formula E Race at Home Challenge’, the  chance to drive a real Formula E car. Siggy completed his laps in the  Gen2 car at the ‘Circuit Ricardo Tormo’ and had a first taste of the  forces at work in the cockpit. “The car was really cool and it was  fantastic to be able to drive on the real racetrack in it,” said Siggy  afterwards. “I hadn’t expected it to feel so lively through the fast  turns. I had oversteer a few times and the front wheels locked up a  few times when braking. The Formula E car is tricky to drive. That’s  why it's absolutely understandable that we went out behind the safety  car. In particular, I was impressed by the torque and the power that  is applied through the turns and under braking. You just don’t feel  that in the simulator. Overall, I tried to squeeze every last drop of  enjoyment out of this drive.” Siggy spent the entire race weekend in the paddock, visiting the pit  area for BMW i Andretti Motorsport, where team principal Roger  Griffiths showed him the BMW iFE.21 and explained how everything works  in the team. Siggy also met BMW i Andretti Motorsport driver  Maximilian Günther (GER), who he had coached last year for his sim  racing appearances in the ‘Race at Home Challenge’. IMSA iRacing Pro Series.Two out of three races in the IMSA iRacing Pro Series took place in  April. BMW works drivers celebrated some fine results. This applied  first and foremost to Philipp Eng (AUT), who drive the virtual BMW M8  GTE to victory in the season-opener at Sebring and in the second race  at Laguna Seca. After these two wins from two races, he heads the  overall standings before the third and final race on 6th May, at Road  Atlanta. “I am delighted to be back racing in the IMSA iRacing Pro  Series,” said Eng. “I think it is always great for there to be a  virtual race series taking place in parallel to the one in the real  world. The calendar is short and sweet, with three races. I have  prepared extremely well for all three races and, just like last year,  I am taking it very seriously. We are lucky that we have a very strong  team in the background to take care of setup and strategy. Now I am  really excited about the finale. The competition is really strong, so  winning the championship would mean even more to me.” Behind Eng,  Bruno Spengler (CAN) and Connor De Phillippi (USA) secured one-two  results for BMW in Sebring and Laguna Seca respectively. Augusto  Farfus (BRA), John Edwards (USA) and Turner Motorsport driver Robby  Foley (USA) are also competing for BMW. iRacing 24h Nürburgring.The BMW SIM Racing Teams celebrated a top-three lock-out in the  virtual BMW M4 GT3 at one of the highlights of the season on the  iRacing simulation platform, the Special 24h Nürburgring powered by  VCO. After 153 laps on the Nürburgring-Nordschleife, Maximilian  Benecke (GER), Chris Lulham (GBR) and Formula 1 driver Max Verstappen  (NED) claimed victory for the BMW Team Redline. “Pole position,  fastest lap and then the race win - that was a mega race for us and  there were only a few heart-stopping situations. The car did really  well and it felt like we could go to the limit on every lap,” was how  Benecke summed it up. Team BMW Bank crossed the line in second place,  followed by the BMW Team GB in third position. G2 Esports.The BMW Team G2 Esports has enjoyed an eventful month with numerous  races on the Assetto Corsa Competizione platform. Without a doubt, the  greatest success was Nils Naujoks’ title win in the British GT Esports  Championship with the virtual BMW M4 GT4 in the GT4 class. Naujoks had  already won the race at the start of April on the Brands Hatch  circuit, where his team-mate Gregor Schill finished in third place.  After finishing fourth in the penultimate race, Naujoks recorded a  dominant victory from pole position in the season finale to claim the  class win and the title. G2 Esports was also very active at the wheel of the virtual BMW M6  GT3 in April. The high point was marked by victory for Naujoks and  Arthur Kammerer in the third round of the SimGrid Sprint Cup at the  Imola circuit. The G2 Esports team crossed the line in 16th place at  the season-opener in the prestigious ‘The SimGrid x VCO World Cup’,  the 12h Bathurst. Interview with Nils Naujoks.  Congratulations on winning the title in the British GT Esports    Championship! What did you think about the season and the    championship format?Nils Naujoks: “Many thanks! The races with multiple classes were  certainly something new for us. For virtually my entire sim racing  career, I have been involved in one-make cups or have just raced  within one class. And if I had been involved in a race with multiple  classes, I was normally in one of the faster cars. So, I had to get  used to looking in the mirror a lot more and learn how to let the  faster GT3 cars go past without losing any time myself. In addition,  the real racing drivers also had to adjust to the sim racing  environment and they had to get used to the level as well. That  improved from race to race, so that there were no more major incidents  towards the end of the season.” How important is collaboration like that with BMW SIM Racing    for you as a team, and for the Assetto Corsa Competizione platform?Naujoks: “It helps the whole sim racing scene hugely when a major  player like BMW decides to get involved. It demonstrates recognition  of what we are doing and helps us to make our intensive hobby more  professional, as well as making sim racing more attractive for  partners. Of course, we at G2 Esports benefit from this as we have  more resources to work with than other teams, and it provides  additional motivation.” What highlights do you and the team have to look forward to now?Naujoks: “The British GT Esports Championship was only the beginning  – the season is just getting started. We are focusing on the SimGrid  and SRO series, which have already begun or will be starting soon.  This series contain sprint and endurance formats, meaning that the  weeks and months ahead will be anything but boring for us. The results  in the British GT Esports Championship mean that I have received a  wildcard for the SRO championship, which is a huge help in terms of  time management. I won’t have to complete hot laps each week to  qualify. We only have to wait a few weeks for the next highlight, the  24 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps in the ‘Sim Grid x VCO World Cup’, where  we are hoping to score plenty of points in the BMW M6 GT3.” BMW SIM M2 CS Racing Cup.Jiri Toman (CZE) and defending champion Erhan Jajovski (MKD) are the  latest pair of sim racers to secure their tickets for this year’s BMW  SIM M2 CS Racing Cup finale on the rFactor 2 platform. Toman was  declared the winner after a dramatic finish to the third race of the  season in the virtual one-make trophy at Silverstone. Second place  went to Marcell Csincsik (HUN), who had already claimed his ticket for  the finale with victories in the first two races. Risto Kappet (EST)  finished in third place. Jajovski secured his first win of the season  in the fourth race of the season, which took place on the Nürburgring  Grand Prix circuit. Jajovski had dominated the series last year before  winning the season finale at the BMW SIM Live 2020 event. Johannes  Drayss (GER) and Joonas Raivio (FIN) followed him to complete the  podium. Csincsik, Toman and Jajovski will be joined at the finale by  Michal Smidl (CZE), who secured his place by finishing second in the  second race of the season. The two final races in the BMW SIM M2 CS  Racing Cup take place on 3rd May (Sebring) and on 17th May (Indianapolis).\n"}
